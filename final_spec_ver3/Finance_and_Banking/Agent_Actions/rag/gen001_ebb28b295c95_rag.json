    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes ethical practices, compliance, and consumer protection. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring professional verification. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical issues, from tax avoidance and insider trading to bias detection in lending. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling predatory lending and fiduciary responsibilities. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of cybersecurity or data privacy, which are critical in finance.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 15, SPEC 5 and SPEC 6). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for ethical practices and compliance. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on transforming requests into educational content, which may not be adaptable to all contexts."
