    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial and banking operations. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial interactions, such as regulatory compliance, risk management, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12) and overlapping areas that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybersecurity, ethical practices, and user protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as market volatility and cross-border transactions. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital currencies more comprehensively.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17) and overlapping requirements that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, and could be simplified for better practicality."
