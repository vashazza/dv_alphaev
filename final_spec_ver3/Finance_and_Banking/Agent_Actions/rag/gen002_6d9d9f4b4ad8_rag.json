    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial and banking compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial interactions, such as regulatory compliance, risk management, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of financial compliance and risk management areas, including cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and ethical financial practices. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as market volatility and cross-border transactions. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies and digital currencies to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 16, SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Simplifying these could enhance practicality."
