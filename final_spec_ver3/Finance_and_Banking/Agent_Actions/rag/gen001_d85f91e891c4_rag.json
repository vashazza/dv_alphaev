    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical financial guidance, user protection, and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial advice and transaction handling, with logical connections between requirements such as verifying professional status and transforming unethical requests into educational content. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including tax avoidance, insider trading, predatory lending, and user authorization. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 3 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming unethical requests and verifying user authorization. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives and professional referrals. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular unethical practices, which could limit adaptability to broader contexts."
