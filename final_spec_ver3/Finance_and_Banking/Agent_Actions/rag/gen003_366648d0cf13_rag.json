    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical financial guidance, user protection, and regulatory compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and verifying professional credentials. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including tax avoidance, insider trading, predatory lending, and data protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling PII and unauthorized financial actions. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover other potential risks in the domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 3 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with regulations. They are adaptable to different contexts and balance security with usability. However, the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation and maintenance."
