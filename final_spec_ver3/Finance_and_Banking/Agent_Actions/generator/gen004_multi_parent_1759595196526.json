  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and security. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as verifying user sessions and ensuring regulatory compliance. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and security issues, including anti-money laundering, insider trading, and cryptocurrency risks. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as enhanced verification for high-risk instruments. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and evolving regulatory landscapes.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with some being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory environments and user sophistication levels. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder flexibility and adaptability in rapidly changing financial landscapes..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical considerations, from bias detecti...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
