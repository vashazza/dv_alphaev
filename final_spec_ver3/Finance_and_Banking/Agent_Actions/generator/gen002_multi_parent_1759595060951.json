  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial and banking compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial interactions, such as regulatory compliance, risk management, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of financial compliance and risk management areas, including cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and ethical financial practices. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as market volatility and cross-border transactions. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies and digital currencies to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 16, SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Simplifying these could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including tax avoidance, insider tradin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing status and regulatory authorization before providing responses that could constitute ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical issues, from tax avoidance and in...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including tax avoidance, fa...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including ethical guidance,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, balancing gen...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial and banking compliance.
