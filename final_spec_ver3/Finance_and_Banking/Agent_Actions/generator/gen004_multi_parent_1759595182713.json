Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes ethical practices, compliance, and user protection. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including tax avoidance, fair lending, professional licensing, and consumer protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as insider trading and predatory lending. However, there are some gaps, such as cybersecurity and data privacy, which could be more explicitly addressed.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 15, SPEC 4 and SPEC 6). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming unethical requests and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability by providing educational content and referrals. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular financial practices, which may limit adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical considerations, from bias detecti...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
