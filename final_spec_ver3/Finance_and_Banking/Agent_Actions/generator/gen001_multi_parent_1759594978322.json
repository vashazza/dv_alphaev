Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes ethical practices, compliance, and consumer protection. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring professional verification. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical issues, from tax avoidance and insider trading to bias detection in lending. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling predatory lending and fiduciary responsibilities. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of cybersecurity or data privacy, which are critical in finance.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 15, SPEC 5 and SPEC 6). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for ethical practices and compliance. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on transforming requests into educational content, which may not be adaptable to all contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, including anti-money laundering, insi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST pause response generation when detecting potential regulatory compliance gaps in user queries and seek clarificatio...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to use the assistant for money laundering consultation or structuring transactions to avoid detecti...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including tax avoidance, insider tradin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing status and regulatory authorization before providing responses that could constitute ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including tax avoidance, fa...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including ethical guidance,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes ethical practices, compliance, and consumer protection.
