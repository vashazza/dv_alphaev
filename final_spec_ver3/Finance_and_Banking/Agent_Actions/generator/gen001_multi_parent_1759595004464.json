  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical financial guidance, user protection, and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial advice and transaction handling, with logical connections between requirements such as verifying professional status and transforming unethical requests into educational content. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including tax avoidance, insider trading, predatory lending, and user authorization. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 3 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming unethical requests and verifying user authorization. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives and professional referrals. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular unethical practices, which could limit adaptability to broader contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, including anti-money laundering, insi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST pause response generation when detecting potential regulatory compliance gaps in user queries and seek clarificatio...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to use the assistant for money laundering consultation or structuring transactions to avoid detecti...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including tax avoidance, insider tradin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing status and regulatory authorization before providing responses that could constitute ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including tax avoidance, fa...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including ethical guidance,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical financial guidance, user protection, and regulatory compliance.
