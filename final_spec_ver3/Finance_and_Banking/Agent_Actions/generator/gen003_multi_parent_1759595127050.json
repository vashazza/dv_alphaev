  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical financial guidance, user protection, and regulatory compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and verifying professional credentials. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including tax avoidance, insider trading, predatory lending, and data protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling PII and unauthorized financial actions. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover other potential risks in the domain.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 3 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with regulations. They are adaptable to different contexts and balance security with usability. However, the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical issues, from tax avoidance and in...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including tax avoidance, fair lending, ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical considerations, from bias detecti...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, balancing gen...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including bias detection, ethical guid...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical issues, including tax avoidance, ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing status and regulatory authorization before providing responses that could constitute ...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical financial guidance, user protection, and regulatory compliance.
