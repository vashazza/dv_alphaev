  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial and banking operations. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial interactions, such as regulatory compliance, risk management, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12) and overlapping areas that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybersecurity, ethical practices, and user protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as market volatility and cross-border transactions. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital currencies more comprehensively.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17) and overlapping requirements that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, and could be simplified for better practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, including anti-money laundering, insi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST pause response generation when detecting potential regulatory compliance gaps in user queries and seek clarificatio...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to use the assistant for money laundering consultation or structuring transactions to avoid detecti...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including tax avoidance, insider tradin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing status and regulatory authorization before providing responses that could constitute ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, cybe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT execute API calls to financial institutions or trading platforms when user queries contain emotional language, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific adv...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including tax avoidance, fa...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including ethical guidance,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide guidance on structuring offshore accounts for tax avoidance, instead redirecting to legitimate internat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending c...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial and banking operations.
