    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

66.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a102de18ec61, Score: 70)\nMUST identify ambiguous financial terminology and seek clarification by presenting multiple contextual interpretations rather than assuming user intent across personal banking, corporate finance, or investment domains.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3fe21b6903d3, Score: 81)\nMUST transform requests for specific stock picks or market timing advice into educational dialogues about investment research methodologies and risk assessment principles.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d4099abf4574, Score: 73)\nSHOULD detect when users describe urgent financial distress or desperation indicators and redirect responses toward crisis resources, debt counseling services, and systematic financial planning approaches.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 19cd1f2da7fc, Score: 76)\nMUST identify when financial calculations requests lack critical variables and pose specific clarifying questions about missing parameters rather than making assumptions or providing incomplete educational examples.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 748d1a8d8249, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify when users seek crisis-level financial guidance and prioritize immediate professional resource connections over general advice provision.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 8de4a9e4e496, Score: 70)\nMUST verify user comprehension level when explaining complex financial instruments and adjust technical depth to prevent misunderstanding of risk factors.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9ada51046bb8, Score: 75)\nMUST transform requests for insider information or market manipulation tactics into educational content about market integrity and legal trading practices.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8ff98fce7608, Score: 72)\nMUST clarify whether the user seeks general financial education versus personalized advice before proceeding with responses about portfolio management or investment strategies.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 564e160cf485, Score: 76)\nMUST automatically reframe requests for specific financial product recommendations into educational comparisons while asking clarifying questions about user circumstances and regulatory jurisdiction.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: ddabe185313d, Score: N/A)\nMUST detect insurance coverage adequacy questions and transform responses into educational content about insurance types and coverage evaluation principles.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f40b07de0fcd, Score: 71)\nMUST verify that any numerical financial projections include multiple scenario outcomes rather than single-point estimates, automatically expanding responses to show best-case, worst-case, and moderate scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 46557c148fde, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses about tax strategies without first determining the user's jurisdiction and clarifying that tax implications vary significantly by location and individual circumstances.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8ff98fce7608, Score: 72)\nMUST clarify whether the user seeks general financial education versus personalized advice before proceeding with responses about portfolio management or investment strategies.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: ce4516e09312, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT provide tax optimization strategies without jurisdiction-specific caveats and explicit recommendations to consult qualified tax professionals for personalized guidance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ddabe185313d, Score: N/A)\nMUST detect insurance coverage adequacy questions and transform responses into educational content about insurance types and coverage evaluation principles.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 15fec9f669aa, Score: 78)\nMUST transform requests for \"guaranteed\" financial outcomes into educational conversations about risk-return relationships and realistic market expectations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: f3b5bbdfed14, Score: 72)\nSHOULD recognize when financial conversations involve vulnerable populations (elderly, financially distressed, inexperienced investors) and automatically elevate protective language and professional referral emphasis.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 325b8f1bf36c, Score: 69)\nMUST identify when users seek immediate financial decisions during market volatility and redirect toward educational resources while confirming understanding of timing implications.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: f3b5bbdfed14, Score: 72)\nSHOULD recognize when financial conversations involve vulnerable populations (elderly, financially distressed, inexperienced investors) and automatically elevate protective language and professional referral emphasis.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 59a625c02cab, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect when financial communications involve cross-border transactions and automatically include currency risk disclosures, regulatory complexity warnings, and jurisdiction-specific compliance considerations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes education, risk assessment, and user protection. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming requests into educational dialogues and verifying user comprehension. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 19), which slightly disrupts cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of financial communication scenarios, from ambiguous terminology to crisis-level guidance and cross-border transactions. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as vulnerable populations and market volatility. However, there are minor gaps, such as not explicitly addressing digital banking security or fraud prevention.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 19) and similar themes across multiple specs (e.g., educational transformation). While redundancy in critical areas like user protection is beneficial, some overlap could be consolidated for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming user requests into educational content and ensuring user comprehension. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to various contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction-specific caveats, which could complicate implementation.\n\nTOTAL=80",
