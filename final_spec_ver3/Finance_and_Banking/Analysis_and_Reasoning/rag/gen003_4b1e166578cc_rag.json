    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ensuring accurate and responsible financial analysis and advice. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial data interpretation, risk disclosure, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including risk disclosure, ethical considerations, and data interpretation. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, such as transforming speculative requests into educational content. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules on data privacy or cybersecurity, which are also crucial in the financial domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, such as identical specs (SPEC 6 and SPEC 8) and similar themes repeated across different specs (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines that are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which might limit their applicability across diverse scenarios."
