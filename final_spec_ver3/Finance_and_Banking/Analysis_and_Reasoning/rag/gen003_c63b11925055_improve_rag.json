    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of financial analysis, risk assessment, and compliance, with logical connections between identifying conflicts, ensuring transparency, and maintaining ethical standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial and banking compliance areas, including risk assessment, ethical practices, and data protection. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, such as preventing predatory lending and ensuring data privacy. However, some critical areas, like cybersecurity or fraud detection, are not explicitly covered, indicating potential gaps.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 11, SPEC 12 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication, which could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like data protection and ethical financial advice. They balance security with usability by transforming complex requests into educational content. However, some rules are overly specific, which might limit adaptability across different contexts."
