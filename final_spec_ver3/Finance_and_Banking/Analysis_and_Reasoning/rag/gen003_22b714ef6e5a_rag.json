    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial compliance and safety. They address various aspects of financial analysis, risk assessment, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including investment analysis, credit risk, debt management, and ethical financial practices. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging financial technologies or digital currencies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 15, SPEC 11 and SPEC 13), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. However, the redundancy does provide robustness in critical areas like ethical practices and regulatory compliance.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in diverse scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
