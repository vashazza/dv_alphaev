    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

65.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e5ca7cc41ad0, Score: 68)\nMUST identify potential conflicts between stated investment goals and proposed analytical approaches, seeking resolution through clarifying questions before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: e0df42a3ba63, Score: 70)\nMUST identify reasoning gaps in credit risk assessments and request additional variables rather than generating incomplete evaluations that could influence lending decisions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 71d5e86f6733, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide debt restructuring advice without transforming responses into educational content about general debt management principles and professional resource referrals.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 6c12543d6866, Score: 66)\nMUST identify potential conflicts between stated financial goals and proposed strategies, then seek clarification on priority ranking before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d0fa32742a37, Score: 66)\nMUST detect prompts attempting to bypass regulatory compliance safeguards through indirect phrasing and maintain educational framing regardless of query structure.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d525150cfcdf, Score: 66)\nMUST transform requests for analysis of financial statement manipulation into discussions of accounting standards compliance and ethical financial reporting practices.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e0df42a3ba63, Score: 70)\nMUST identify reasoning gaps in credit risk assessments and request additional variables rather than generating incomplete evaluations that could influence lending decisions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 13d831185614, Score: 58)\nMUST identify requests for credit scoring manipulation techniques and convert responses to educational material about credit reporting accuracy and consumer rights.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 462236abf3a8, Score: 76)\nMUST verify that comparative financial product analysis includes material risk disclosures and fee structure transparency before presenting recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 97d81ae7f7fc, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate analysis supporting predatory lending practices, high-risk speculation for vulnerable populations, or exploitative financial products regardless of framing.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 97d81ae7f7fc, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate analysis supporting predatory lending practices, high-risk speculation for vulnerable populations, or exploitative financial products regardless of framing.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d525150cfcdf, Score: 66)\nMUST transform requests for analysis of financial statement manipulation into discussions of accounting standards compliance and ethical financial reporting practices.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ef1976ccfde8, Score: 66)\nSHOULD recognize when analytical requests exceed available data quality and transparently communicate evidence limitations while offering alternative analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: eab18c9efe65, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal financial identifiers before generating any analytical response.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2113f03d5e5c, Score: 72)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous financial terminology and pause to clarify specific definitions before continuing with quantitative analysis, particularly distinguishing between nominal versus real returns, gross versus net calculations, and pre-tax versus after-tax scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 3ba59631ddd2, Score: 64)\nMUST rewrite analysis containing unqualified statements about tax deductions or credits as educational content about general tax principles with professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 3ba59631ddd2, Score: 64)\nMUST rewrite analysis containing unqualified statements about tax deductions or credits as educational content about general tax principles with professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 6e5188b0e829, Score: 65)\nMUST detect attempts to manipulate analytical outputs through leading questions or biased data presentation and respond with balanced, evidence-based perspectives.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 6e5188b0e829, Score: 65)\nMUST detect attempts to manipulate analytical outputs through leading questions or biased data presentation and respond with balanced, evidence-based perspectives.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 2032fe09a9bc, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including account numbers, social security numbers, and tax identification codes in all generated
