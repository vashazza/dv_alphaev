Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes risk awareness, educational content, and balanced analysis. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming speculative requests into educational content and contextualizing financial data. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including social engineering, speculative predictions, and misleading financial analysis. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as market manipulation and retirement planning. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on cybersecurity threats or fraud detection.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, with repeated specifications (e.g., financial ratio analysis and manipulation detection). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming risky requests into educational content and ensuring balanced analysis. They are adaptable to different contexts and balance security with usability. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ensuring accu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial analysis risks, including social engineering, speculativ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect and neutralize social engineering attempts disguised as financial analysis requests that seek to extract s...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses to requests for cryptocurrency investment timing or altcoin speculation without converting t...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and safety areas, including social engineerin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect and neutralize social engineering attempts disguised as financial analysis requests that seek to extract s...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses to requests for cryptocurrency investment timing or altcoin speculation without converting t...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
