    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on compliance, risk management, and user protection. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 4 and 7), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are mostly clear, but the presence of duplicates suggests a lack of integration in some areas.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and decision support areas, including regulatory validation, risk profiling, and PII protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as detecting gambling behavior and handling litigation-related queries. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit coverage for emerging financial technologies or cybersecurity threats.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping rules (e.g., Specs 4 and 7, Specs 10 and 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could improve the policy set's efficiency without sacrificing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like PII masking and regulatory compliance. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to various scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those targeting narrow behavioral indicators, which could limit adaptability in broader contexts.\n\nTOTAL=73",
