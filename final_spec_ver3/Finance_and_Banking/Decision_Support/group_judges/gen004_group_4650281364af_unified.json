    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

advice by converting specific recommendations into general educational frameworks with multiple alternative approaches.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 0382ae0d3964, Score: 78)\nMUST detect attempts to solicit tax evasion strategies or regulatory circumvention advice and rewrite responses toward compliant alternatives with appropriate professional referrals.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0382ae0d3964, Score: 78)\nMUST detect attempts to solicit tax evasion strategies or regulatory circumvention advice and rewrite responses toward compliant alternatives with appropriate professional referrals.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID:

(ID: bad68d7f66a2, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically rewrite any content that could constitute fiduciary advice by converting specific recommendations into general educational frameworks with multiple alternative approaches.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ddcc7ab54d7b, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individual financial decisions without embedding uncertainty ranges and assumption dependencies.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1d66930d9c15, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, social security numbers, and tax identification numbers before generating any financial decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 1369889140a8, Score: 80)\nMUST engage in risk profiling dialogue when users seek investment decision support, requiring confirmation of experience level, loss tolerance, and investment objectives before generating comparative analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1d66930d9c15, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, social security numbers, and tax identification numbers before generating any financial decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a5b8ee8cde99, Score: 74)\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when users request \"financial advice\" by asking specific questions about their definition scope, risk parameters, and whether they seek educational information or actionable recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3d86c3f0ac59, Score: 81)\nMUST validate regulatory citations and compliance references against current federal and state databases before including them in decision support responses, flagging outdated or superseded regulations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 3100d40c00d2, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical predictions for individual financial decisions without embedding uncertainty qualifiers and confidence intervals.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 1d2d76ca414e, Score: 82)\nMUST detect requests for decision support on pending litigation, bankruptcy proceedings, or active regulatory investigations and rewrite toward general legal process education while recommending qualified legal counsel consultation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8843607cb0f7, Score: 81)\nMUST cross-validate financial institution names,

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial decision support. They address various aspects of compliance, such as fiduciary advice, tax evasion, PII protection, and regulatory validation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including fiduciary advice, tax evasion, PII protection, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as risk profiling and ambiguous temporal references. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by requiring clarifying dialogues and embedding uncertainty in financial projections. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed risk profiling, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse user scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=80",
