    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on compliance, risk management, and user protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., cross-validation and PII masking), which could indicate a lack of integration or communication between different policy areas. The specs do complement each other in terms of ensuring compliance and safety, but the repetition suggests potential gaps in logical connections.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of compliance and risk management issues, such as PII protection, regulatory compliance, and risk profiling. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests a lack of coverage in other critical areas that could have been addressed. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is somewhat skewed due to the repetition, which limits the overall coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=12  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of the same or very similar requirements (e.g., cross-validation, PII masking, and numerical prediction constraints). This indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on compliance and risk management. However, the repetition of certain rules may complicate implementation and maintenance. The rules are mostly flexible and broadly applicable, but the redundancy could hinder adaptability and usability in different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=67",
