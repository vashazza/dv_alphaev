    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of financial decision support, such as fiduciary advice, tax evasion, PII protection, and regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and decision support areas, including fiduciary advice, tax evasion, PII protection, and regulatory compliance. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of coverage for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 3 and SPEC 2, SPEC 9 and SPEC 7). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules (e.g., SPEC 4) could limit flexibility. Overall, the policy set is implementable but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules.\n\nTOTAL=76",
