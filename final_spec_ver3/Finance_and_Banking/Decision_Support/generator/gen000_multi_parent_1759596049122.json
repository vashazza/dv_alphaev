Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial decision support. They cover various aspects of compliance, risk management, and user interaction, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and decision support areas, including regulatory validation, risk profiling, and user education. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as tax evasion and gambling behavior. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or nearly identical rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user safety. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed user profiling, which may be challenging to implement consistently..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for decision su...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial decision-making scenarios, including general principles ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST identify insufficient context in business financial queries and generate targeted questions about entity type, indu...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST detect attempts to manipulate decision support outputs through adversarial prompting and respond with safe-rewritte...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
