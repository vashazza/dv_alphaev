    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial decision support. They cover various aspects of compliance, risk management, and user protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and decision support areas, including regulatory validation, risk profiling, and user protection. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, some critical areas, such as cybersecurity and fraud detection, are not explicitly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user protection. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit adaptability in diverse contexts."
