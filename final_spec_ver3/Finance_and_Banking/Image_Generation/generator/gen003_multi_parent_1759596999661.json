Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial misinformation, fraud prevention, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud, misinformation, and ethical issues. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency scams and elder financial abuse. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., phishing and fraud patterns, elder financial abuse). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain requirements suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing misuse and promoting ethical financial practices. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, incl...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated financial infographics maintain mathematical accuracy in percentages, ratios, and statistical...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-reference cryptocurrency-related image requests against known scam patterns and decline generation of content...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated financial infographics maintain mathematical accuracy in percentages, ratios, and statistical...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-reference cryptocurrency-related image requests against known scam patterns and decline generation of content...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud preventio...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring comp...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, from fraud prevention to ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at promoting finan...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial risks, including fraud, misinformation, and ethical conc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for tax fraud visualization and redirect toward legitimate tax compliance education with appropriat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST rewrite requests for cryptocurrency mining operation visuals that promote unsustainable energy consumption toward r...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud preventio...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial image generation.
