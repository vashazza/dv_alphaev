Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial image generation. They complement each other by focusing on different facets of compliance, such as fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as tax fraud and elder financial abuse. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital asset risks..

They complement each other by focusing on different facets of compliance, such as fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as tax fraud and elder financial abuse. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital asset risks.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 10) and overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 18). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition could be consolidated for efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting harmful requests to educational or protective resources. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, which may limit adaptability across different contexts. The focus on educational redirection is a practical approach, but the specificity in some areas could hinder broader applicability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card detai...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST NOT create images showing specific bank login interfaces, mobile banking screens, or financial ...\n  - [3] (Score: 67) MUST transform requests for deceptive financial imagery into transparent educational materials that ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
