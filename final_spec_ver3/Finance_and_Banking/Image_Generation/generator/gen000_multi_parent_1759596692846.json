Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing misinformation and promoting financial literacy. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial image generation, such as fraud prevention, ethical guidance, and educational redirection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 5, SPEC 4 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud prevention, ethical considerations, and educational redirection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as protecting vulnerable populations and addressing specific financial schemes. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and digital finance trends to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with identical or very similar specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 5, SPEC 4 and SPEC 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on redirecting harmful requests to educational or protective resources. They balance security with usability by transforming potentially harmful prompts into educational content. However, some specifications may be overly specific, such as those focusing on particular fraud types, which could limit adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud preventio...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud,...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for tax fraud visualization and redirect toward legitimate tax compliance education with appropriat...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST rewrite requests for cryptocurrency mining operation visuals that promote unsustainable energy consumption toward r...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud,...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for tax fraud visualization and redirect toward legitimate tax compliance education with appropriat...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST rewrite requests for cryptocurrency mining operation visuals that promote unsustainable energy consumption toward r...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial risks, including scams, fraud, and misinformation, while...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated financial infographics maintain mathematical accuracy in percentages, ratios, and statistical...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-reference cryptocurrency-related image requests against known scam patterns and decline generation of content...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing misinformation and promoting financial literacy.
