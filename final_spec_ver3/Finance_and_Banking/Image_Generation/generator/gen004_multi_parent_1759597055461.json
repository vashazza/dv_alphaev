  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and compliant financial image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial integrity, such as fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as protecting vulnerable populations and addressing specific fraudulent schemes. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies and digital assets.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 10) and overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated for efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting harmful requests to educational or protective resources. They balance security with usability by transforming potentially harmful prompts into educational content. However, some specifications may be overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud preventio...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, from fraud pr...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated financial infographics maintain mathematical accuracy in percentages, ratios, and statistical...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-reference cryptocurrency-related image requests against known scam patterns and decline generation of content...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated financial infographics maintain mathematical accuracy in percentages, ratios, and statistical...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-reference cryptocurrency-related image requests against known scam patterns and decline generation of content...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud preventio...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, incl...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST rewrite requests for images showing \"foolproof\" investment strategies or \"guaranteed\" wealth-building schemes to di...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and compliant financial image generation.
