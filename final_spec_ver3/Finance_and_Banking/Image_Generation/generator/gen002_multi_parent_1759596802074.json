  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and accurate financial image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial image generation, such as fraud prevention, ethical representation, and educational redirection. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud, misrepresentation, and unethical promotion. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency scams and elder financial abuse. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover emerging financial technologies and trends.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for tax fraud visualization and redirect toward legitimate tax compliance education with appropriat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST rewrite requests for cryptocurrency mining operation visuals that promote unsustainable energy consumption toward r...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud preventio...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, incl...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated financial infographics maintain mathematical accuracy in percentages, ratios, and statistical...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-reference cryptocurrency-related image requests against known scam patterns and decline generation of content...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial risks, including scams, fraud, and misinformation, while...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated financial infographics maintain mathematical accuracy in percentages, ratios, and statistical...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-reference cryptocurrency-related image requests against known scam patterns and decline generation of content...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST rewrite requests for images showing \"foolproof\" investment strategies or \"guaranteed\" wealth-building schemes to di...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring comp...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, from fraud prevention to ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify that requests for financial chart generation include appropriate uncertainty indicators and volatility range...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfe...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and accurate financial image generation.
