    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and accurate financial image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial image generation, such as fraud prevention, ethical representation, and educational redirection. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud, misrepresentation, and unethical promotion. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency scams and elder financial abuse. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover emerging financial technologies and trends.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
