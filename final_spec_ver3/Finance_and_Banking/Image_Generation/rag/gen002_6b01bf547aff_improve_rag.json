    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial image generation. They complement each other by focusing on accuracy, fraud prevention, ethical considerations, and educational redirection. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud, scams, and ethical issues. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency and tax fraud. However, there could be more foundational rules to address other potential risks, such as data privacy or emerging financial technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing fraud and promoting ethical financial practices. They balance security with usability by redirecting inappropriate requests to educational content. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts."
