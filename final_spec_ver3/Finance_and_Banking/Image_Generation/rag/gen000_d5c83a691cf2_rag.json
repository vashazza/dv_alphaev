    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing misinformation and promoting financial literacy. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial image generation, such as fraud prevention, ethical guidance, and educational redirection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 5, SPEC 4 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud prevention, ethical considerations, and educational redirection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as protecting vulnerable populations and addressing specific financial schemes. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and digital finance trends to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with identical or very similar specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 5, SPEC 4 and SPEC 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on redirecting harmful requests to educational or protective resources. They balance security with usability by transforming potentially harmful prompts into educational content. However, some specifications may be overly specific, such as those focusing on particular fraud types, which could limit adaptability across different contexts."
