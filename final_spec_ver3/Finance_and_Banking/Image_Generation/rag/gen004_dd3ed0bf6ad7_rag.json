    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and compliant financial image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial integrity, such as fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including fraud prevention, educational redirection, and data protection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as protecting vulnerable populations and addressing specific fraudulent schemes. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies and digital assets.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 10) and overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated for efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting harmful requests to educational or protective resources. They balance security with usability by transforming potentially harmful prompts into educational content. However, some specifications may be overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts."
