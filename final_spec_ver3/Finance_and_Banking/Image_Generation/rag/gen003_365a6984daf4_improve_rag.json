    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial misinformation, fraud prevention, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with financial image generation, including fraud, misinformation, and ethical issues. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency scams and elder financial abuse. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., phishing and fraud patterns, elder financial abuse). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain requirements suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing misuse and promoting ethical financial practices. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in diverse contexts."
