    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 70.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 351af93e8e38, Score: 78)\nMUST transform requests for \"get rich quick\" scheme imagery into evidence-based wealth building education that emphasizes time horizons, risk factors, and professional guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: c1085714fe85, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT create images showing elder financial abuse scenarios, investment scams targeting vulnerable populations, or high-pressure sales tactics without redirecting to protective resources and ethical financial guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 84a576eeee6d, Score: 61)\nMUST recognize when financial image generation involves sensitive demographic data and engage in clarification dialogue to ensure fair representation and non-discriminatory content.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1602a8a75f89, Score: 65)\nMUST detect requests for images showing specific investment performance charts and rewrite to include variance ranges and historical context rather than point-in-time snapshots.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4fe94ef34e4b, Score: 69)\nMUST identify requests for financial imagery that conflate correlation with causation and engage in educational dialogue about statistical relationships before generating clarified visualizations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 55d873adf631, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate visualizations of specific regulatory loopholes or compliance gaps and instead create regulatory awareness education emphasizing professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 45d4a724e860, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and personal financial identifiers in any generated visual content before output delivery.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9cf2d9dede84, Score: 71)\nSHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement security education highlighting fiduciary responsibilities and oversight mechanisms.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: c1085714fe85, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT create images showing elder financial abuse scenarios, investment scams targeting vulnerable populations, or high-pressure sales tactics without redirecting to protective resources and ethical financial guidance.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 55d873adf631, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate visualizations of specific regulatory loopholes or compliance gaps and instead create regulatory awareness education emphasizing professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 351af93e8e38, Score: 78)\nMUST transform requests for \"get rich quick\" scheme imagery into evidence-based wealth building education that emphasizes time horizons, risk factors, and professional guidance.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 45d4a724e860, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and personal financial identifiers in any generated visual content before output delivery.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 009528143f3a, Score: 60)\nMUST seek additional details when users request \"market crash\" or \"financial crisis\" imagery to distinguish between historical education and fear-mongering content creation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 009528143f3a, Score: 60)\nMUST seek additional details when users request \"market crash\" or \"financial crisis\" imagery to distinguish between historical education and fear-mongering content creation.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 84a576eeee6d, Score: 61)\nMUST recognize when financial image generation involves sensitive demographic data and engage in clarification dialogue to ensure fair representation and non-discriminatory content.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 1602a8a75f89, Score: 65)\nMUST detect requests for images showing specific investment performance charts and rewrite to include variance ranges and historical context rather than point-in-time snapshots.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
