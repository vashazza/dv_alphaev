    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes consumer protection, regulatory compliance, and ethical financial practices. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational opportunities and ensuring compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial and banking compliance areas, including consumer protection, regulatory adherence, and ethical practices. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling PII and cryptocurrency guidance. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on cybersecurity threats or fraud detection, which are critical in the financial domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 5, 19 and SPEC 11, 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring regulatory compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction-specific regulatory references, which may complicate implementation."
