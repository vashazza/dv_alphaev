    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes consumer protection, regulatory compliance, and ethical financial practices. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational opportunities and ensuring compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical issues, including predatory lending, insurance regulations, credit scoring, and cryptocurrency investments. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and complex financial instruments. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., specs 1, 5, and 19; specs 11 and 16; specs 12 and 17; specs 13 and 18). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with regulations. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction-specific regulatory references, which could complicate implementation."
