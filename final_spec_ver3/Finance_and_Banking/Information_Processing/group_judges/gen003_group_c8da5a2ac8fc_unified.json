    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on regulatory compliance, user education, and risk management. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 4, 15, and 17; Specs 11, 16, and 18), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. Despite this, the specs collectively aim to ensure compliance and user protection, forming a coherent strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and user protection areas, including regulatory compliance, risk management, and user education. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as data privacy and cybersecurity, are not explicitly addressed, indicating potential gaps in coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with identical specifications (e.g., Specs 4, 15, and 17; Specs 11, 16, and 18), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on compliance and user education. They balance security with usability by transforming specific guidance into educational content. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on cryptocurrency, which may limit adaptability across different financial contexts.\n\nTOTAL=73",
