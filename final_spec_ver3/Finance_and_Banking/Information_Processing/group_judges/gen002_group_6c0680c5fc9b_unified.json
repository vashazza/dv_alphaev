    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial information processing. They address various aspects of financial advice, regulatory compliance, and user interaction. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 2 and 11, Specs 8 and 12, Specs 10 and 13, Specs 3 and 14), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion by introducing unnecessary duplication.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and safety issues, including fiduciary responsibilities, emotional distress in financial queries, derivatives trading, credit scoring, international banking, insider information, and cryptocurrency advice. However, the coverage could be improved by including more foundational rules that apply across multiple scenarios, as the current set leans towards specific cases without a strong overarching framework.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim or addressing very similar issues. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level of duplication here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating similar specs could improve the overall robustness without unnecessary repetition.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user safety. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to cryptocurrency and derivatives trading, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability.\n\nTOTAL=69",
