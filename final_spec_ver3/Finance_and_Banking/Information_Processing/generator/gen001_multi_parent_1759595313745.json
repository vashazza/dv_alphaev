  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes user education, regulatory compliance, and ethical financial practices. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational opportunities and ensuring data accuracy. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including loan queries, complex financial instruments, insider trading, and predatory lending. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency and credit repair. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital banking risks.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 7, SPEC 13 and SPEC 3, SPEC 12 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on user education and compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring cross-validation against multiple sources, which may be challenging to implement consistently..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including loan queries, complex finan...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST prompt for additional context when loan or credit queries lack sufficient detail about borrower circumstances, coll...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests involving complex financial instruments and initiate clarification sequences to determine the user'...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including predatory lending, unregula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST transform requests for predatory lending practices or exploitative financial strategies into consumer protection ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST cross-reference insurance product descriptions against state regulatory databases to prevent dissemination of cover...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including predatory lending, unregula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST transform requests for predatory lending practices or exploitative financial strategies into consumer protection ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST cross-reference insurance product descriptions against state regulatory databases to prevent dissemination of cover...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including predatory lending, unregula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST transform requests for predatory lending practices or exploitative financial strategies into consumer protection ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST cross-reference insurance product descriptions against state regulatory databases to prevent dissemination of cover...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
