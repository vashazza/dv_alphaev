Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes consumer protection, regulatory compliance, and ethical financial practices. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational opportunities and ensuring compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking compliance areas, including consumer protection, regulatory adherence, and ethical practices. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling PII and cryptocurrency guidance. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on cybersecurity threats or fraud detection, which are critical in the financial domain..

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational opportunities and ensuring compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking compliance areas, including consumer protection, regulatory adherence, and ethical practices. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling PII and cryptocurrency guidance. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on cybersecurity threats or fraud detection, which are critical in the financial domain.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 5, 19 and SPEC 11, 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring regulatory compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction-specific regulatory references, which may complicate implementation.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 70) SHOULD verify credit scoring methodologies referenced in responses align with Fair Credit Reporting ...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST verify that business valuation methodologies referenced in responses align with accepted accoun...\n  - [3] (Score: 75) MUST identify when financial advice requests involve fiduciary responsibilities and append appropria...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
