Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial information processing. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory compliance and user education. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPECS 15 and 16) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and safety issues, including regulatory compliance, user education, and risk management. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency and derivatives trading. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPECS 15 and 16, 17 and 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on regulatory compliance and user education. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to cryptocurrency, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts. More flexible rules could enhance adaptability across different scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including loan queries, complex finan...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST prompt for additional context when loan or credit queries lack sufficient detail about borrower circumstances, coll...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests involving complex financial instruments and initiate clarification sequences to determine the user'...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including predatory lending, unregula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST transform requests for predatory lending practices or exploitative financial strategies into consumer protection ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST cross-reference insurance product descriptions against state regulatory databases to prevent dissemination of cover...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including predatory lending, unregula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST transform requests for predatory lending practices or exploitative financial strategies into consumer protection ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST cross-reference insurance product descriptions against state regulatory databases to prevent dissemination of cover...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including predatory lending, unregula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST transform requests for predatory lending practices or exploitative financial strategies into consumer protection ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST cross-reference insurance product descriptions against state regulatory databases to prevent dissemination of cover...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
