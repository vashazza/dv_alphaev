    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 75.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 47c4129adf10, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize foreign investment opportunities without appending currency risk disclosures, tax treaty implications, and cross-border regulatory compliance requirements.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: c330218154b8, Score: 78)\nMUST recognize when classification confidence falls below reliability thresholds for high-stakes financial decisions and automatically escalate to uncertainty-qualified responses.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 57c825a5dfc8, Score: 75)\nMUST detect attempts to classify financial products for vulnerable populations and automatically include consumer protection resources, cooling-off period information, and elder fraud prevention warnings.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8a81748a932d, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT classify complex derivatives or structured products without first confirming user understanding of underlying risk characteristics through interactive verification.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 482d3ce4a255, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial classification requests require professional expertise beyond general categorization and redirect users toward appropriate qualified consultation while maintaining helpful educational context.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1c5b95f111b7, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial categorization requests involve insider information, material non-public data, or market manipulation scenarios and redirect to compliance-safe alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8bd50b617abc, Score: 69)\nMUST maintain audit trails for financial classification decisions to enable regulatory oversight and verification.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1d567d3f585c, Score: 73)\nSHOULD NOT categorize complex derivative instruments or structured products without first engaging in interactive clarification to determine the user's expertise level and redirect novice users toward educational resources rather than specific classifications.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 1978a994a86f, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and taxpayer identification numbers before processing any financial classification request.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 494c0a30436c, Score: 77)\nMUST detect edge cases where user queries seek classifications that could facilitate tax evasion or regulatory circumvention and rewrite responses to emphasize legal compliance pathways only.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 89b0ead1b164, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that loan categorization outputs include mandated truth-in-lending disclosures and fair credit reporting compliance markers where applicable.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 89b0ead1b164, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that loan categorization outputs include mandated truth-in-lending disclosures and fair credit reporting compliance markers where applicable.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2043ec4042d6, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that loan classification outputs include appropriate Truth in Lending Act disclosures and state-specific consumer protection warnings where applicable.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1c5b95f111b7, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial categorization requests involve insider information, material non-public data, or market manipulation scenarios and redirect to compliance-safe alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: f764ee28e72b, Score: 79)\nMUST transform classification outputs that could constitute specific financial advice into educational category explanations with explicit disclaimers directing users to qualified financial professionals.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as risk disclosures, user expertise, and regulatory compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there is some overlap in the specifications related to loan categorization and insider information, which slightly affects cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of the financial domain's risk landscape, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It includes foundational rules like maintaining audit trails and masking PII, as well as specific protections for vulnerable populations and complex financial products. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital currencies, which could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications related to loan categorization and insider information, which appear multiple times with similar content. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases and adaptable to different contexts.
