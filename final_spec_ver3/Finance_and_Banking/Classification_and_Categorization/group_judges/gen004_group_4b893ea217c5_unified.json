    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 69.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b98ddd6c6f00, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal identifiers in all banking categorization responses while preserving analytical utility through anonymized placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 5d37ddf7916f, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification queries involving bankruptcy, foreclosure, or debt collection scenarios and rewrite responses to emphasize legal rights and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 4eac1ece99bd, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT classify cryptocurrency or digital assets without acknowledging regulatory uncertainty and the evolving nature of legal frameworks across different jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 076dbac92cba, Score: 76)\nMUST validate classification confidence levels against regulatory precision requirements and escalate low-confidence categorizations to qualified professional review recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 57c825a5dfc8, Score: 75)\nMUST detect attempts to classify financial products for vulnerable populations and automatically include consumer protection resources, cooling-off period information, and elder fraud prevention warnings.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 3b3b81afc294, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT present insurance product categorizations without concurrent disclosure of coverage limitations and state-specific regulatory variations affecting classification accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 729f15efb4b0, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize cryptocurrency, digital assets, or emerging financial technologies without current regulatory status disclaimers and volatility warnings.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 5975f4188ee3, Score: 80)\nMUST validate that financial product categorizations align with current regulatory definitions by cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources before presenting definitive classifications.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 08310f5bb8eb, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification confidence falls below established thresholds for regulated financial categories and append uncertainty qualifiers to prevent misleading categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 08310f5bb8eb, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification confidence falls below established thresholds for regulated financial categories and append uncertainty qualifiers to prevent misleading categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 4acef9b9f926, Score: 70)\nSHOULD rewrite responses involving cryptocurrency or digital asset classifications to emphasize regulatory uncertainty and evolving legal frameworks while asking clarifying questions about the user's specific use case and jurisdiction.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 1bc717868a4a, Score: 66)\nSHOULD recognize when financial categorization involves ESG criteria or sustainable investing principles and acknowledge the subjective nature of such classifications while providing transparency about underlying methodologies and potential greenwashing risks.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 80342e7d04a8, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present tax category classifications without concurrent dialogue confirming relevant tax year, jurisdiction, and individual circumstances affecting categorization accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2043ec4042d6, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that loan classification outputs include appropriate Truth in Lending Act disclosures and state-specific consumer protection warnings where applicable.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 57c825a5dfc8, Score: 75)\nMUST detect attempts to classify financial products for vulnerable populations and automatically include consumer protection resources, cooling-off period information, and elder fraud prevention warnings.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as vulnerable populations and ESG criteria. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar issues like cryptocurrency regulation and classification confidence. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it leads to inefficiencies that could be consolidated to improve clarity and reduce overlap.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection.
