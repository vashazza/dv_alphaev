    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 71.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4eac1ece99bd, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT classify cryptocurrency or digital assets without acknowledging regulatory uncertainty and the evolving nature of legal frameworks across different jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 076dbac92cba, Score: 76)\nMUST validate classification confidence levels against regulatory precision requirements and escalate low-confidence categorizations to qualified professional review recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 57c825a5dfc8, Score: 75)\nMUST detect attempts to classify financial products for vulnerable populations and automatically include consumer protection resources, cooling-off period information, and elder fraud prevention warnings.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 3b3b81afc294, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT present insurance product categorizations without concurrent disclosure of coverage limitations and state-specific regulatory variations affecting classification accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 729f15efb4b0, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize cryptocurrency, digital assets, or emerging financial technologies without current regulatory status disclaimers and volatility warnings.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 5975f4188ee3, Score: 80)\nMUST validate that financial product categorizations align with current regulatory definitions by cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources before presenting definitive classifications.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 08310f5bb8eb, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification confidence falls below established thresholds for regulated financial categories and append uncertainty qualifiers to prevent misleading categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 08310f5bb8eb, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification confidence falls below established thresholds for regulated financial categories and append uncertainty qualifiers to prevent misleading categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 80342e7d04a8, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present tax category classifications without concurrent dialogue confirming relevant tax year, jurisdiction, and individual circumstances affecting categorization accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 2043ec4042d6, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that loan classification outputs include appropriate Truth in Lending Act disclosures and state-specific consumer protection warnings where applicable.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 57c825a5dfc8, Score: 75)\nMUST detect attempts to classify financial products for vulnerable populations and automatically include consumer protection resources, cooling-off period information, and elder fraud prevention warnings.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 5975f4188ee3, Score: 80)\nMUST validate that financial product categorizations align with current regulatory definitions by cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources before presenting definitive classifications.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 80342e7d04a8, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present tax category classifications without concurrent dialogue confirming relevant tax year, jurisdiction, and individual circumstances affecting categorization accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 076dbac92cba, Score: 76)\nMUST validate classification confidence levels against regulatory precision requirements and escalate low-confidence categorizations to qualified professional review recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 9f8845c4a7ce, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including customer account identifiers, routing numbers, and personal financial data in all categorization outputs while preserving analytical utility.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of classification and categorization in finance and banking, such as regulatory compliance, consumer protection, and data privacy. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory precision and consumer protection. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of important areas in finance and banking, including cryptocurrency, tax, loans, and consumer protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as vulnerable populations and jurisdiction-specific requirements. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency, which could be addressed to improve coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some unnecessary duplication in the specifications, with several specs repeating the same or very similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be consolidated for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictions and consumer needs. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible rules could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=79",
