    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 75.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 494c0a30436c, Score: 77)\nMUST detect edge cases where user queries seek classifications that could facilitate tax evasion or regulatory circumvention and rewrite responses to emphasize legal compliance pathways only.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f764ee28e72b, Score: 79)\nMUST transform classification outputs that could constitute specific financial advice into educational category explanations with explicit disclaimers directing users to qualified financial professionals.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1093f206da59, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that credit risk categorizations include appropriate consumer protection disclosures and fair lending compliance indicators.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: c330218154b8, Score: 78)\nMUST recognize when classification confidence falls below reliability thresholds for high-stakes financial decisions and automatically escalate to uncertainty-qualified responses.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f0905a3a99a9, Score: 76)\nMUST detect edge cases where financial data spans multiple regulatory jurisdictions and prompt for geographic scope clarification before applying classification taxonomies.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ca76679bc1b2, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 5975f4188ee3, Score: 80)\nMUST validate that financial product categorizations align with current regulatory definitions by cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources before presenting definitive classifications.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 729f15efb4b0, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize cryptocurrency, digital assets, or emerging financial technologies without current regulatory status disclaimers and volatility warnings.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 5975f4188ee3, Score: 80)\nMUST validate that financial product categorizations align with current regulatory definitions by cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources before presenting definitive classifications.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 5d37ddf7916f, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification queries involving bankruptcy, foreclosure, or debt collection scenarios and rewrite responses to emphasize legal rights and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 1d567d3f585c, Score: 73)\nSHOULD NOT categorize complex derivative instruments or structured products without first engaging in interactive clarification to determine the user's expertise level and redirect novice users toward educational resources rather than specific classifications.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 076dbac92cba, Score: 76)\nMUST validate classification confidence levels against regulatory precision requirements and escalate low-confidence categorizations to qualified professional review recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1093f206da59, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that credit risk categorizations include appropriate consumer protection disclosures and fair lending compliance indicators.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 3b3b81afc294, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT present insurance product categorizations without concurrent disclosure of coverage limitations and state-specific regulatory variations affecting classification accuracy.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance and user protection. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as jurisdictional considerations, regulatory compliance, and user education. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of financial and banking compliance areas, including tax, credit risk, financial products, and emerging technologies. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as bankruptcy and cryptocurrency. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risk areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user protection. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling complex financial scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
