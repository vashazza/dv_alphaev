    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as regulatory compliance, consumer protection, and risk management. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory precision and consumer protection. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in the treatment of cryptocurrency and digital assets, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial classification scenarios, including market timing, bankruptcy, cryptocurrency, insurance, and tax categorizations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as those for vulnerable populations and ESG criteria. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency, which could be addressed to enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing cryptocurrency and digital assets, which appear multiple times with similar requirements. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The repetition of certain specs, such as those related to vulnerable populations, also suggests potential for consolidation.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling uncertainty and requiring professional consultation. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring interactive clarification for tax categorizations, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios."
