    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as regulatory compliance, consumer protection, and the handling of sensitive information. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory precision and consumer protection. However, there are minor overlaps, particularly in the handling of cryptocurrency and digital assets, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including PII protection, regulatory compliance, consumer protection, and the handling of emerging financial technologies. The specifications balance general principles with specific edge cases, such as vulnerable populations and ESG criteria. However, there could be more emphasis on other emerging financial products and technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with the repeated emphasis on cryptocurrency and digital asset classifications. Specifications 3, 7, and 11 cover similar ground and could be consolidated to reduce overlap. While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas, such as regulatory compliance, the repetition in certain areas suggests inefficiency that could be improved.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring accurate classifications. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on cryptocurrency, which may limit adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
