    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of financial classification, such as market timing, bankruptcy, cryptocurrency, and tax categorizations, with a focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory precision and consumer protection. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in cryptocurrency and digital asset classifications, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of financial classification scenarios, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses critical compliance areas like regulatory uncertainty, consumer protection, and tax categorizations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency, which could enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to cryptocurrency and digital assets, which appear multiple times with similar requirements. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it could be reduced to improve efficiency without compromising robustness. Consolidating similar specs would enhance the overall efficiency of the policy set.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling various financial classification scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to cryptocurrency, which may limit adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would improve practicality."
