    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as user understanding, regulatory compliance, and data protection. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on user education and compliance with legal standards. However, there are some repeated themes, such as tax categorizations, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including consumer protection, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as insider information and tax evasion. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of cybersecurity threats or digital fraud, which are critical in the financial sector.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly concerning tax categorizations and the handling of complex financial products. Several specs address similar issues, such as user understanding and regulatory compliance, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is necessary for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user protection. They balance security with usability by providing educational resources and redirecting users to professional advice when necessary. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to tax categorizations, which may limit their applicability across different contexts."
