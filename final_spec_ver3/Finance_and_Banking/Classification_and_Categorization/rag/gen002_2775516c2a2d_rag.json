    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance and user protection. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as jurisdictional considerations, regulatory compliance, and user education. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of financial and banking compliance areas, including tax, credit risk, financial products, and emerging technologies. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as bankruptcy and cryptocurrency. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risk areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user protection. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling complex financial scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
