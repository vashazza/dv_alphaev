Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for multimodal tasks in the finance and banking domain. They address various aspects of financial data handling, regulatory compliance, and user protection. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10, 12, and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and user protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting elder financial abuse and insider trading. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specifications addressing emerging financial technologies or cybersecurity threats.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (SPEC 10, 12, and 13) that could be consolidated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of financial compliance and safety issues, from fraud pre...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 62): SHOULD detect cross-modal inconsistencies between financial data types and flag potential manipulation attempts or data ...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD NOT provide detailed credit repair instructions when multimodal evidence suggests potential identity theft situat...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, from money laundering and regulatory ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate money laundering when detecting suspicious transaction patterns in mul...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of financial compliance and safety issues, balancing gene...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific cryptocurrency trading signals when multimodal analysis reveals emotiona...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): SHOULD NOT generate responses when detecting manipulated or doctored financial documents through inconsistent formatting...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for multimodal ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including regulatory compliance, fraud ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST verify modal consistency between textual financial claims and accompanying charts, graphs, or numerical data before...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect when multimodal inputs attempt to bypass safety measures through modality switching and consolidate all co...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for multimodal tasks in the finance and banking domain.
