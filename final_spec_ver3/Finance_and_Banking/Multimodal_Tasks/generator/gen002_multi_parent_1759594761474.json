Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of financial compliance and safety. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial transactions, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection. However, there is some redundancy, particularly with SPEC 6 and SPEC 12, which are identical, slightly affecting cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, from money laundering and regulatory circumvention to consumer protection and data integrity. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as elder financial abuse and aggressive debt collection. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency.. Redundancy: While the group maintains robustness by addressing critical areas, there is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the duplication of SPEC 6 and SPEC 12. Some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on cryptocurrency promotional language, which could limit their applicability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, from money laundering and regulatory ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate money laundering when detecting suspicious transaction patterns in mul...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of financial risks, including fraud, identity theft, and ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific cryptocurrency trading signals when multimodal analysis reveals emotiona...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): SHOULD NOT generate responses when detecting manipulated or doctored financial documents through inconsistent formatting...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
