    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial risk, such as fraud detection, insider trading, and identity protection. However, there is some overlap, particularly with insider information detection (SPEC 4 and SPEC 13), which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of financial compliance and safety issues, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses critical areas like fraud, insider trading, and identity theft, while also considering multimodal inputs. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies beyond SPEC 1's focus on cryptocurrency trading signals.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the duplication of SPEC 4 and SPEC 13, which both address insider information in financial charts. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, this duplication does not add significant value and could be consolidated. Other specifications are generally distinct and avoid unnecessary overlap.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for detecting and responding to various financial risks. However, some specifications could be overly specific, such as SPEC 10's focus on modality conversion, which might limit flexibility. Overall, the rules are adaptable to different contexts but could benefit from more general applicability in certain areas."
