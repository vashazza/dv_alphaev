    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for multimodal tasks in the finance and banking domain. They address various aspects of financial data handling, regulatory compliance, and user protection. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10, 12, and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and user protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting elder financial abuse and insider trading. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specifications addressing emerging financial technologies or cybersecurity threats.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (SPEC 10, 12, and 13) that could be consolidated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios, slightly reducing practicality."
