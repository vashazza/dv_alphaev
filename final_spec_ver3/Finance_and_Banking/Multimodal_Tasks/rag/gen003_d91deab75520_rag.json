    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial interactions, such as fraud prevention, user education, and risk management. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of financial compliance and safety issues, from fraud prevention to user education and crisis management. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling emotional distress in financial decisions. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as identical specifications (SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 3 and SPEC 14). These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. The redundancy in critical areas is appropriate, but the repetition of certain specs suggests room for improvement.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as detecting emotional distress or potential fraud. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
