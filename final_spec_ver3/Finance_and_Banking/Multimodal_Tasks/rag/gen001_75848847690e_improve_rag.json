    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They cover various aspects of financial and banking compliance, such as verifying data consistency, detecting fraudulent activities, and ensuring regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 12 and 13) that could have been consolidated, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, including multimodal content verification, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as elder financial abuse and insider trading. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with Specs 12, 13, and 16, which are repeated. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like fraud detection and regulatory compliance. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those targeting specific financial content types, which may limit adaptability across different contexts."
