    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming potentially harmful requests into educational examples and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including regulation circumvention, unauthorized access, and compliance with fair lending practices. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency and credit scoring. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies like AI in finance.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specs, with multiple entries addressing similar issues like regulation circumvention and credit scoring manipulation. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful requests into educational content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
