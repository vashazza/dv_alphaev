    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial code generation. They address various aspects of compliance, security, and risk management, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 11 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including cryptocurrency, financial calculations, and fraud detection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific regulatory frameworks beyond PCI compliance.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 11 and SPEC 7, SPEC 17 and SPEC 9, SPEC 18 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide a good balance between security and usability. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
