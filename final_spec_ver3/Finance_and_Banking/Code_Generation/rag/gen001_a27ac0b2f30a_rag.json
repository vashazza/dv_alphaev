    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial code generation. They address various aspects of compliance, security, and user education, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 11 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, security, and user education. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as cryptocurrency volatility and loan origination compliance. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 11 and SPEC 7, SPEC 14 and SPEC 6). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing heavily on cryptocurrency, which may limit their applicability in broader financial contexts."
