    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a unified policy framework, focusing on compliance, education, and risk management in financial code generation. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are present, but the repetition slightly detracts from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance issues, including regulation circumvention, data privacy, and fair lending practices. However, there is a lack of foundational rules that could provide a more comprehensive framework. The focus is heavily on specific scenarios, such as cryptocurrency and credit scoring, which leaves potential gaps in other critical compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specs, with several specifications addressing similar issues (e.g., PII masking and regulation circumvention). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating overlapping requirements could improve the group's efficiency without sacrificing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user education. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on cryptocurrency and credit scoring, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability.\n\nTOTAL=69",
