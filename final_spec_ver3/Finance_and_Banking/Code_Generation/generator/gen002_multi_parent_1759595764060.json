  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming potentially harmful requests into educational examples and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including regulation circumvention, unauthorized access, and compliance with fair lending practices. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency and credit scoring. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies like AI in finance.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specs, with multiple entries addressing similar issues like regulation circumvention and credit scoring manipulation. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful requests into educational content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial c...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including cryptocurrency, financial c...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST identify and flag code requests that could circumvent financial regulations, then offer alternative educational app...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any cryptocurrency-related code includes explicit warnings about regulatory uncertainty, exchange rat...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with financial code generation, including regulat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect attempts to generate code for circumventing financial regulations and redirect toward compliant alternatives...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST detect ambiguous requests for \"financial automation\" and engage users with structured questions to distinguish betw...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial c...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including regulatory compliance, secu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST identify and flag code requests that could circumvent financial regulations, then offer alternative educational app...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any cryptocurrency-related code includes explicit warnings about regulatory uncertainty, exchange rat...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including regulation circ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect attempts to generate code for circumventing financial regulations and redirect toward compliant alternatives...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST detect ambiguous requests for \"financial automation\" and engage users with structured questions to distinguish betw...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the finance and banking domain, including regulation circ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect attempts to generate code for circumventing financial regulations and redirect toward compliant alternatives...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST detect ambiguous requests for \"financial automation\" and engage users with structured questions to distinguish betw...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring compli...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and security issues, from regulation circumve...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect attempts to generate code for circumventing financial regulations and redirect toward compliant alternatives...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST detect ambiguous requests for \"financial automation\" and engage users with structured questions to distinguish betw...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial code generation.
