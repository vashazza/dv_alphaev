Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring compliance and security in financial code generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial regulation, security, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 2 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and security issues, from regulation circumvention to secure coding practices. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptocurrency mining and credit scoring manipulation. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies or specific regional compliance requirements.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specs, with several addressing similar issues (e.g., regulation circumvention and credit scoring manipulation). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition of certain specs suggests inefficiencies that could be streamlined for better clarity and focus.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by incorporating educational elements and structured questioning. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit their adaptability across different contexts and scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 84/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial c...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections.
