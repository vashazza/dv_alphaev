    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on compliance and ethical standards in finance and banking. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial content generation, such as cryptocurrency, financial advice, and consumer protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including cryptocurrency, financial advice, predatory lending, and estate planning. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency. The coverage could be improved by including more foundational rules applicable to a wider range of financial scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 16, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like financial advice and consumer protection. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on cryptocurrency or estate planning.
