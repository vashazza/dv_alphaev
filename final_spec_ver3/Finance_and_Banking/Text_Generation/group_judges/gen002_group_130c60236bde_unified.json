    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on compliance, risk management, and ethical considerations in financial content generation. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11) that suggest a lack of integration and coordination among the rules, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, and financial reporting. However, there is a noticeable emphasis on specific scenarios like cryptocurrency and stock recommendations, with less focus on other critical areas such as consumer lending or insurance. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases could be improved.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specs, with multiple instances of identical or nearly identical rules (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 13). This suggests inefficiency and a lack of consolidation, which could be streamlined to improve robustness without unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical compliance measures like risk warnings and ethical education. However, the repetition of specific rules and the focus on narrow scenarios (e.g., cryptocurrency) may limit adaptability and usability across different financial contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=69",
