    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance, risk awareness, and ethical practices in finance and banking. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with regulations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including foreign exchange, cryptocurrency, insider trading, money laundering, and consumer protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as transforming requests for unethical practices into educational content. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital banking risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11) and overlapping requirements that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications could be more flexible to cover multiple use cases, and there is a slight tendency towards overly specific rules in certain areas."
