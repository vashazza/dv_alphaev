    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance, risk management, and ethical standards in financial content generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and risk management areas, including cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, and ethical financial practices. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency and more detailed coverage of traditional banking risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications overlapping in their focus on similar areas, such as cryptocurrency content and financial advice. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could hinder practical implementation. The specs could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules to cover multiple use cases effectively."
