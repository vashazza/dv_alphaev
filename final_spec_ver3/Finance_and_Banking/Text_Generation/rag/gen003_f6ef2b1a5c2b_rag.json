    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance, risk management, and ethical standards in financial content generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and risk management areas, including cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, and financial advice. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging financial technologies or specific regional regulations.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 9, SPEC 13 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could hinder practical implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
