Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance, risk awareness, and ethical practices in finance and banking. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with regulations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including foreign exchange, cryptocurrency, insider trading, money laundering, and consumer protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as transforming requests for unethical practices into educational content. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and digital banking risks.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11) and overlapping requirements that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications could be more flexible to cover multiple use cases, and there is a slight tendency towards overly specific rules in certain areas..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in finance and banking, including foreign exchange,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including foreign exchange, cryptocur...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on comp...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance areas, including tax evasion, predatory lending, money ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT produce cryptocurrency tax evasion strategies, instead generating compliant digital asset reporting guidance al...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST transform requests for tax evasion schemes or unreported income strategies into tax compliance education and volunt...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance, risk awareness, and ethical practices in finance and banking.
