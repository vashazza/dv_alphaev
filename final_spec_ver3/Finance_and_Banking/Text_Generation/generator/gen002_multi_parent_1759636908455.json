Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance, risk management, and ethical standards in financial content generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the focus on regulatory compliance and consumer protection. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and risk management areas, including cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, and ethical financial practices. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging financial technologies beyond cryptocurrency and more detailed coverage of traditional banking risks.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications overlapping in their focus on similar areas, such as cryptocurrency content and financial advice. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could hinder practical implementation. The specs could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules to cover multiple use cases effectively..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including foreign exchange, cryptocur...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on comp...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance areas, including tax evasion, predatory lending, money ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT produce cryptocurrency tax evasion strategies, instead generating compliant digital asset reporting guidance al...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST transform requests for tax evasion schemes or unreported income strategies into tax compliance education and volunt...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and risk management areas, including cryptocu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes compliance, risk management, and ethical standards in financial content generation.
