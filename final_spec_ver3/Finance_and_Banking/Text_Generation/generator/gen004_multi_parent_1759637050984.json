  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 69.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on compliance, risk management, and ethical considerations in financial content generation. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11) that suggest a lack of integration and coordination among the rules, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, and financial reporting. However, there is a noticeable emphasis on specific scenarios like cryptocurrency and stock recommendations, with less focus on other critical areas such as consumer lending or insurance. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases could be improved.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy in the specs, with multiple instances of identical or nearly identical rules (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 13). This suggests inefficiency and a lack of consolidation, which could be streamlined to improve robustness without unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical compliance measures like risk warnings and ethical education. However, the repetition of specific rules and the focus on narrow scenarios (e.g., cryptocurrency) may limit adaptability and usability across different financial contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and ethical issues, including cryptocurrency,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial and banking risks, including foreign exchange, cryptocur...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at transf...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including anti-money laundering, consu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for money laundering techniques or structuring guidance into anti-money laundering compliance ed...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST transform requests for predatory lending schemes or exploitative financial practices into educational content about...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on complian...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance and risk management areas, including cryptocu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 69/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on compliance, risk ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including cryptocurrency, foreign exch...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect foreign exchange trading strategy requests and rewrite to emphasize currency volatility risks and regulatory...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect generation of cryptocurrency investment content and automatically include volatility warnings, regulatory un...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on compliance, risk management, and ethical considerations in financial content generation.
