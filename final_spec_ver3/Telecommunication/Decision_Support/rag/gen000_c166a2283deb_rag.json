    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of telecommunications decision support, such as regulatory compliance, data privacy, and capacity planning. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory compliance and safety. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of topics relevant to telecommunications, including regulatory compliance, data privacy, and decision-making processes. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as indigenous territory considerations and cross-border data routing. However, there are minor gaps in areas like emerging technologies and evolving regulatory landscapes.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly regarding regulatory compliance and data privacy. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, some overlapping requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness without excessive duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
