    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommunication decision support. They cover various aspects such as bandwidth optimization, troubleshooting, compliance, and critical infrastructure, with logical connections between them. However, there are a few areas where the integration could be tighter, such as better linking between general principles and specific scenarios.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including compliance, security, and infrastructure. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas like cybersecurity and user privacy could be more explicitly addressed. The balance between broad and specific rules is mostly maintained, but there are minor gaps in emerging technology and disaster recovery.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, a few specifications overlap, such as those dealing with critical infrastructure and professional consultation advisories. Consolidating these could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness. The redundancy is mostly appropriate, but there is room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in different contexts. The practicality could be improved by making some requirements more flexible and broadly applicable."
