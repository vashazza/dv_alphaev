    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommunications decision support. They cover various aspects such as regulatory compliance, data privacy, and environmental considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 14, SPEC 4 and SPEC 15, SPEC 2 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including regulatory compliance, data privacy, and environmental considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as indigenous territories and cross-border data routing. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies like 5G or AI integration in telecom.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 14, SPEC 4 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
