    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of telecommunication decision support, such as regulatory compliance, security, and performance validation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory approval and security considerations. However, there is some overlap in the focus on rewriting responses, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including regulatory compliance, security, and performance validation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as fraud prevention and legacy system vulnerabilities. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies and their specific compliance challenges.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification on rewriting responses containing unverified performance benchmarks (SPEC 8 and SPEC 13). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, this duplication could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as international standards and legacy systems. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit disclosures in vendor selection, which may limit flexibility in certain scenarios."
