    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 70.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 221aa6f0b031, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosures before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7da3400362e2, Score: 65)\nSHOULD detect uncertainty in telecommunication decision contexts and explicitly communicate confidence levels while offering multiple scenario-based alternatives rather than single-point recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 58d78ec74461, Score: 70)\nMUST transform vague troubleshooting requests into structured diagnostic conversations by asking specific questions about error symptoms, affected network segments, and recent configuration changes.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 911f9204260a, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for telecommunication merger or acquisition scenarios without embedding competition law consultation advisories and market impact considerations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b05a7522a00d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for network configuration changes that could affect emergency services or critical infrastructure without explicit professional consultation advisories and regulatory compliance verification.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a1fbb695fc16, Score: 52)\nSHOULD identify when telecommunication investment decisions involve emerging technology adoption and balance innovation potential against deployment risk factors in response weighting.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 09fe572c437c, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including network access credentials, device identifiers, subscriber authentication keys, and customer location data in all telecommunication decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: c82843ed7d1c, Score: 65)\nSHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative pathway analysis with degradation impact assessments.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: db471f997484, Score: 79)\nMUST detect requests involving critical infrastructure telecommunications and redirect toward qualified professional consultation while providing general educational context only.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 2839f864c0fa, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite vague requests by asking clarifying questions about network scale, user count, geographic distribution, and service level expectations before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0ccb2eb471b1, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate decision support for disaster recovery scenarios without emphasizing that backup communication strategies require multi-stakeholder coordination and professional validation.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 025f22010fff, Score: 75)\nSHOULD recognize when telecommunication decisions affect accessibility compliance and embed ADA requirement verification before offering service modification guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b46a887711aa, Score: 70)\nMUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when proposed solutions may conflict with treaty obligations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: c8fb4f57e8a5, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that certification testing requires accredited laboratory validation beyond theoretical specification matching.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 573a69d9c62f, Score: 66)\nSHOULD verify satellite communication decisions include orbital mechanics constraints and space weather impact assessments before providing link budget recommendations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommunication decision support. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of decision-making, such as uncertainty, compliance, and critical infrastructure. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation and regulatory compliance. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including bandwidth optimization, critical infrastructure, and compliance with international standards. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as satellite communication and disaster recovery. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and innovation risks more comprehensively.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20  \nComment: While there is some redundancy, particularly in the emphasis on professional consultation and compliance, it is mostly appropriate for ensuring robustness in critical safety areas. Some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap, such as those related to critical infrastructure and compliance advisories.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those involving satellite communication and orbital mechanics, which may limit their applicability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=83",
