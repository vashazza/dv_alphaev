    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 68.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 54a27d240113, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when decision support involves cross-border telecommunications infrastructure and automatically include data sovereignty compliance warnings with jurisdiction-specific regulatory considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d609a734243c, Score: 69)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite responses containing specific equipment vendor vulnerabilities or zero-day exploits into generalized security hardening guidance that preserves utility while preventing weaponization.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6d0cfc7cf0f6, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for cross-border data routing without automatically including data residency laws and sovereignty compliance requirements for affected jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 019fdcb35fdf, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect potential social engineering attempts disguised as technical decision support requests and respond with security awareness guidance instead of requested information.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 6d0cfc7cf0f6, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for cross-border data routing without automatically including data residency laws and sovereignty compliance requirements for affected jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: c8fb4f57e8a5, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that certification testing requires accredited laboratory validation beyond theoretical specification matching.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 54a27d240113, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when decision support involves cross-border telecommunications infrastructure and automatically include data sovereignty compliance warnings with jurisdiction-specific regulatory considerations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 221aa6f0b031, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosures before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 019fdcb35fdf, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect potential social engineering attempts disguised as technical decision support requests and respond with security awareness guidance instead of requested information.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 019fdcb35fdf, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect potential social engineering attempts disguised as technical decision support requests and respond with security awareness guidance instead of requested information.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 54a27d240113, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when decision support involves cross-border telecommunications infrastructure and automatically include data sovereignty compliance warnings with jurisdiction-specific regulatory considerations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7567b392e26a, Score: 68)\nMUST verify through progressive disclosure whether bandwidth optimization decisions involve emergency services or public safety networks before providing capacity reallocation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8fcb53507d33, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for wireless transmission power levels without confirming regulatory emission limits and requiring professional RF exposure assessments for public safety compliance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f41a70a106e5, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device MAC addresses, IP ranges, and subscriber identifiers in all telecommunication decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 96b2b1218cb0, Score: 75)\nMUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandatory consultation requirements with relevant tribal authorities and environmental protection agencies.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 1877907c62ce, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device MAC addresses, IP ranges, and subscriber identifiers in all telecommunication decision support responses.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on data sovereignty, security, and compliance. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion. The specs address various aspects of telecommunications decision support, but the repetition of certain specs suggests a lack of integration.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including data sovereignty, security, and compliance with regulatory standards. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, such as cross-border data routing and indigenous territory considerations. However, some areas, like emerging technologies or broader ethical considerations, might be underrepresented.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 7, 11 and SPEC 4, 9, 10). This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to improve clarity and reduce overlap. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here seems excessive.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world compliance and security issues. They balance security with usability, such as masking personally identifiable information and addressing social engineering. However, the repetition of certain specs and the presence of overly specific rules in some cases may hinder adaptability and implementation.\n\nTOTAL=73",
