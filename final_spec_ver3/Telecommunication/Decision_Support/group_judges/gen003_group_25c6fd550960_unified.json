    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 64.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 0f92bc1d58f7, Score: 63)\nSHOULD rewrite potentially harmful interference scenarios into educational content about proper RF engineering practices and regulatory compliance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 221aa6f0b031, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosures before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c8fb4f57e8a5, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that certification testing requires accredited laboratory validation beyond theoretical specification matching.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b46a887711aa, Score: 70)\nMUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when proposed solutions may conflict with treaty obligations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 2839f864c0fa, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite vague requests by asking clarifying questions about network scale, user count, geographic distribution, and service level expectations before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0043164b7f69, Score: 73)\nMUST automatically rewrite responses containing unverified performance benchmarks by adding uncertainty qualifiers and requesting user validation of testing conditions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 019fdcb35fdf, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect potential social engineering attempts disguised as technical decision support requests and respond with security awareness guidance instead of requested information.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 911f9204260a, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for telecommunication merger or acquisition scenarios without embedding competition law consultation advisories and market impact considerations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 17a694a905c2, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify when network topology recommendations could expose security vulnerabilities and provide hardened alternatives with defense-in-depth considerations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a21696d30803, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision support involves telecommunications fraud prevention and avoid generating content that could inadvertently assist malicious actors while maintaining educational utility.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0043164b7f69, Score: 73)\nMUST automatically rewrite responses containing unverified performance benchmarks by adding uncertainty qualifiers and requesting user validation of testing conditions.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 1d951b4d2054, Score: 68)\nMUST flag decision support requests involving legacy telecommunication systems that may lack modern security safeguards and require specialized expertise.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0f92bc1d58f7, Score: 63)\nSHOULD rewrite potentially harmful interference scenarios into educational content about proper RF engineering practices and regulatory compliance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 17a694a905c2, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify when network topology recommendations could expose security vulnerabilities and provide hardened alternatives with defense-in-depth considerations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 019fdcb35fdf, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect potential social engineering attempts disguised as technical decision support requests and respond with security awareness guidance instead of requested information.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ff3b0837e914, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including IMEI numbers, subscriber identifiers, and network credentials before presenting telecommunication analysis results.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication decision support. They complement each other by covering different facets such as compliance, security, and performance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6, SPEC 13 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 9, SPEC 15 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of issues relevant to telecommunications, including compliance, security, and performance. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, such as handling legacy systems and social engineering attempts. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests potential gaps in other critical areas that could have been addressed instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with several specifications being repeated verbatim. While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could have been consolidated to improve efficiency. This affects the overall robustness of the policy set.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and potential threats. However, the repetition of certain specifications and the presence of overly specific rules in some cases slightly reduce the practicality and adaptability of the policy set.\n\nTOTAL=78",
