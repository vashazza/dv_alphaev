    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 58.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 0f92bc1d58f7, Score: 63)\nSHOULD rewrite potentially harmful interference scenarios into educational content about proper RF engineering practices and regulatory compliance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 221aa6f0b031, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosures before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c8fb4f57e8a5, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that certification testing requires accredited laboratory validation beyond theoretical specification matching.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b46a887711aa, Score: 70)\nMUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when proposed solutions may conflict with treaty obligations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 2839f864c0fa, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite vague requests by asking clarifying questions about network scale, user count, geographic distribution, and service level expectations before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 019fdcb35fdf, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect potential social engineering attempts disguised as technical decision support requests and respond with security awareness guidance instead of requested information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 911f9204260a, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for telecommunication merger or acquisition scenarios without embedding competition law consultation advisories and market impact considerations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 17a694a905c2, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify when network topology recommendations could expose security vulnerabilities and provide hardened alternatives with defense-in-depth considerations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a21696d30803, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision support involves telecommunications fraud prevention and avoid generating content that could inadvertently assist malicious actors while maintaining educational utility.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 1d951b4d2054, Score: 68)\nMUST flag decision support requests involving legacy telecommunication systems that may lack modern security safeguards and require specialized expertise.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: bc96698b4d69, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect queries requesting confidential network topology information and transform them into general infrastructure planning discussions that exclude specific node locations, routing paths, and vulnerability assessments.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 27ab314b291f, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device MAC addresses, IP ranges, and subscriber identifiers in all telecommunication decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0f92bc1d58f7, Score: 63)\nSHOULD rewrite potentially harmful interference scenarios into educational content about proper RF engineering practices and regulatory compliance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a4ddaba250cf, Score: 64)\nMUST detect and safely rewrite responses containing potentially outdated protocol information by adding temporal context and verification recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 605f62adf528, Score: 64)\nMUST identify requests involving IoT device network integration and rewrite responses to emphasize security-by-design principles over deployment speed.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as fraud prevention and legacy system security. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies and evolving threats, which could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 13 are identical). While some overlap is necessary for robustness, the group could benefit from consolidating similar requirements to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability.
