    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

69.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 02ef9902a6d2, Score: 71)\nMUST transform vague capacity planning queries into structured dialogues that establish current load baselines, growth projections, and budget constraints before offering expansion recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 96b2b1218cb0, Score: 75)\nMUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandatory consultation requirements with relevant tribal authorities and environmental protection agencies.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 8fcb53507d33, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for wireless transmission power levels without confirming regulatory emission limits and requiring professional RF exposure assessments for public safety compliance.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f41a70a106e5, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device MAC addresses, IP ranges, and subscriber identifiers in all telecommunication decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 025f22010fff, Score: 75)\nSHOULD recognize when telecommunication decisions affect accessibility compliance and embed ADA requirement verification before offering service modification guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 54a27d240113, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when decision support involves cross-border telecommunications infrastructure and automatically include data sovereignty compliance warnings with jurisdiction-specific regulatory considerations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 6d0cfc7cf0f6, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for cross-border data routing without automatically including data residency laws and sovereignty compliance requirements for affected jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7da3400362e2, Score: 65)\nSHOULD detect uncertainty in telecommunication decision contexts and explicitly communicate confidence levels while offering multiple scenario-based alternatives rather than single-point recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 7567b392e26a, Score: 68)\nMUST verify through progressive disclosure whether bandwidth optimization decisions involve emergency services or public safety networks before providing capacity reallocation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 58d78ec74461, Score: 70)\nMUST transform vague troubleshooting requests into structured diagnostic conversations by asking specific questions about error symptoms, affected network segments, and recent configuration changes.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 605f62adf528, Score: 64)\nMUST identify requests involving IoT device network integration and rewrite responses to emphasize security-by-design principles over deployment speed.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 221aa6f0b031, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosures before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 6ba009ee057d, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically prompt for clarification when decision support requests involve wireless coverage without specifying indoor versus outdoor deployment, user density, or mobility requirements.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8fcb53507d33, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for wireless transmission power levels without confirming regulatory emission limits and requiring professional RF exposure assessments for public safety compliance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID:

support responses.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 96b2b1218cb0, Score: 75)\nMUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandatory consultation requirements with relevant tribal authorities and environmental protection agencies.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 7702822d3d60, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including device identifiers, network credentials, and subscriber information when providing telecommunications guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommunications decision support. They cover various aspects such as regulatory compliance, data privacy, and environmental considerations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 14, SPEC 4 and SPEC 15), which could indicate a lack of cohesion in terms of unique contributions from each spec.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including regulatory compliance, data privacy, and environmental considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as indigenous territories and cross-border data routing. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or cybersecurity threats beyond IoT.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 14, SPEC 4 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, this level of duplication suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these specs could improve the overall robustness without unnecessary repetition.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as transforming vague queries into structured dialogues. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=75",
