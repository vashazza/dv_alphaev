    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 68.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 02ef9902a6d2, Score: 71)\nMUST transform vague capacity planning queries into structured dialogues that establish current load baselines, growth projections, and budget constraints before offering expansion recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 025f22010fff, Score: 75)\nSHOULD recognize when telecommunication decisions affect accessibility compliance and embed ADA requirement verification before offering service modification guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 54a27d240113, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when decision support involves cross-border telecommunications infrastructure and automatically include data sovereignty compliance warnings with jurisdiction-specific regulatory considerations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 6d0cfc7cf0f6, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for cross-border data routing without automatically including data residency laws and sovereignty compliance requirements for affected jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 7da3400362e2, Score: 65)\nSHOULD detect uncertainty in telecommunication decision contexts and explicitly communicate confidence levels while offering multiple scenario-based alternatives rather than single-point recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7567b392e26a, Score: 68)\nMUST verify through progressive disclosure whether bandwidth optimization decisions involve emergency services or public safety networks before providing capacity reallocation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a4ddaba250cf, Score: 64)\nMUST detect and safely rewrite responses containing potentially outdated protocol information by adding temporal context and verification recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 58d78ec74461, Score: 70)\nMUST transform vague troubleshooting requests into structured diagnostic conversations by asking specific questions about error symptoms, affected network segments, and recent configuration changes.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 605f62adf528, Score: 64)\nMUST identify requests involving IoT device network integration and rewrite responses to emphasize security-by-design principles over deployment speed.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0f92bc1d58f7, Score: 63)\nSHOULD rewrite potentially harmful interference scenarios into educational content about proper RF engineering practices and regulatory compliance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 221aa6f0b031, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosures before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 6ba009ee057d, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically prompt for clarification when decision support requests involve wireless coverage without specifying indoor versus outdoor deployment, user density, or mobility requirements.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: a4ddaba250cf, Score: 64)\nMUST detect and safely rewrite responses containing potentially outdated protocol information by adding temporal context and verification recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 605f62adf528, Score: 64)\nMUST identify requests involving IoT device network integration and rewrite responses to emphasize security-by-design principles over deployment speed.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 17a694a905c2, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify when network topology recommendations could expose security vulnerabilities and provide hardened alternatives with defense-in-depth considerations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
