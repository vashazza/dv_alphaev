    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 73.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 221aa6f0b031, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosures before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: c8fb4f57e8a5, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that certification testing requires accredited laboratory validation beyond theoretical specification matching.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 82287fff906e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide decision support recommendations for spectrum allocation or frequency management without explicitly stating that regulatory approval from telecommunications authorities is mandatory and that interference calculations require professional validation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 09fe572c437c, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including network access credentials, device identifiers, subscriber authentication keys, and customer location data in all telecommunication decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b46a887711aa, Score: 70)\nMUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when proposed solutions may conflict with treaty obligations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 2839f864c0fa, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite vague requests by asking clarifying questions about network scale, user count, geographic distribution, and service level expectations before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 0043164b7f69, Score: 73)\nMUST automatically rewrite responses containing unverified performance benchmarks by adding uncertainty qualifiers and requesting user validation of testing conditions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 911f9204260a, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for telecommunication merger or acquisition scenarios without embedding competition law consultation advisories and market impact considerations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a21696d30803, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision support involves telecommunications fraud prevention and avoid generating content that could inadvertently assist malicious actors while maintaining educational utility.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0043164b7f69, Score: 73)\nMUST automatically rewrite responses containing unverified performance benchmarks by adding uncertainty qualifiers and requesting user validation of testing conditions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 1d951b4d2054, Score: 68)\nMUST flag decision support requests involving legacy telecommunication systems that may lack modern security safeguards and require specialized expertise.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b438ed5695fb, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate vendor selection recommendations without explicitly disclosing potential conflicts of interest, market bias limitations, and requiring independent verification of technical specifications.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 82287fff906e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide decision support recommendations for spectrum allocation or frequency management without explicitly stating that regulatory approval from telecommunications authorities is mandatory and that interference calculations require professional validation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 09fe572c437c, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including network access credentials, device identifiers, subscriber authentication keys, and customer location data in all telecommunication decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b438ed5695fb, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate vendor selection recommendations without explicitly disclosing potential conflicts of interest, market bias limitations, and requiring independent verification of technical specifications.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
