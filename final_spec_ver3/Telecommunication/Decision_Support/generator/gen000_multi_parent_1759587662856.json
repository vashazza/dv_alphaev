  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 69.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on data sovereignty, security, and compliance. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with repeated specs, which slightly detract from overall cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are present but could be more explicitly defined to enhance the unified strategy.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including data sovereignty, security vulnerabilities, and compliance. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as emerging technologies or broader regulatory changes, could be better addressed. The balance between broad and specific rules is mostly maintained, but there are minor gaps in coverage.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy in the specs, with several repeated entries (e.g., Specs 4 and 7, Specs 1 and 9, Specs 6, 11, and 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on cross-border data routing, which may not be applicable in all contexts. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but the adaptability to different scenarios could be improved..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunication ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including regulatory compliance, security...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD rewrite potentially harmful interference scenarios into educational content about proper RF engineering practices...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST verify that bandwidth optimization recommendations include uncertainty bounds and performance limitation disclosure...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
