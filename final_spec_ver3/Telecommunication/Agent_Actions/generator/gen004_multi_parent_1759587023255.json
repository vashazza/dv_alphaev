  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting potentially harmful requests to legitimate practices and ensuring compliance with standards. However, there could be more explicit links between some specs to enhance cohesion further.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, from adversarial prompts to unauthorized access and spectrum usage. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SIM swapping and social engineering. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging threats or new technologies in telecommunications.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly in areas like unauthorized access and fraud prevention. While this redundancy can enhance robustness, it could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, but some consolidation could improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidance on legitimate practices and compliance. However, some specs could be overly specific, potentially limiting their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, from adversarial prompts to unauthorized ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 64): SHOULD detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary protocol specifications and respond with publicly av...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST detect requests for bypassing telecommunication security controls and transform responses into explanations of prop...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including security, compliance with stand...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate that any network security recommendations align with current NIST cybersecurity standards and telecommunic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST initiate clarification dialogue when network configuration requests lack sufficient detail about target equipment m...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including signal interference, identity t...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide specific signal jamming techniques or interference generation methods, instead offering guidance on leg...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands or API calls without first validating against approve...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 69/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including network security, privacy, and...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST automatically sanitize output containing network topology details, IP address ranges, or infrastructure vulnerabili...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST validate that any network security recommendations align with current NIST cybersecurity standards and telecommunic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on security an...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including data protection, network security, and c...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST automatically sanitize output containing network topology details, IP address ranges, or infrastructure vulnerabili...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST validate that any network security recommendations align with current NIST cybersecurity standards and telecommunic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 64/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally aim to enhance security and compliance in telecommunications, focusing on preven...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including fraud prevention, data protection, and accessibil...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 61): RECOMMENDED to detect potential conflicts between requested telecommunication actions and accessibility requirements, of...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT provide responses that could enable SIM cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing without exp...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance.
