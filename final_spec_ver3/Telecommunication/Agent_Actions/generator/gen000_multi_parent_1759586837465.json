Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with standards. However, there could be more explicit links between some specs to enhance cohesion further.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, from adversarial prompts to unauthorized access and spectrum usage. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SIM swapping and toll fraud.

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with standards. However, there could be more explicit links between some specs to enhance cohesion further.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, from adversarial prompts to unauthorized access and spectrum usage. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SIM swapping and toll fraud. However, there might be minor gaps in addressing emerging threats or new technologies in telecommunications.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: The policy set avoids unnecessary duplication, with each spec addressing distinct aspects of telecommunication security. There is appropriate redundancy in critical areas like network security and fraud prevention, ensuring robustness without waste. Some specs could be consolidated for efficiency, but overall redundancy is well-managed.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, with flexible rules covering multiple use cases. However, some specs are slightly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Simplifying these could enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized in...\n  - [2] (Score: 65) MUST NOT generate responses about submarine cable systems without first masking specific landing poi...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands or API calls without first valida...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
