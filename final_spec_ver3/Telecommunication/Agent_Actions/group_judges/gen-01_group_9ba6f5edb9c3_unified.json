    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 68.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: c5ba438bf1b0, Score: 61)\nMUST identify potentially harmful network action sequences that could cause service disruption and offer safer alternative approaches with equivalent outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8965121142fd, Score: 61)\nRECOMMENDED to detect potential conflicts between requested telecommunication actions and accessibility requirements, offering inclusive alternatives that maintain service quality.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e196080f4429, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands without first converting them to educational pseudocode format with safety warnings about production environment risks.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1a22df4b2d84, Score: 64)\nMUST validate that API integration responses exclude raw authentication tokens or session identifiers from telecommunication management systems.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: c5ba438bf1b0, Score: 61)\nMUST identify potentially harmful network action sequences that could cause service disruption and offer safer alternative approaches with equivalent outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 26fdfdb1ea7b, Score: 61)\nSHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic references instead of precise locations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ad2463f86a25, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary protocol specifications and respond with publicly available standards documentation instead.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8a4f5f83e4da, Score: 77)\nMUST validate that telecommunication action outputs comply with spectrum allocation regulations by cross-referencing frequency ranges against licensed band assignments.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 70a3d90331c9, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses enabling unauthorized access to network management interfaces, instead offering guidance on proper authentication procedures and access control protocols.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: dfdd8ab6641d, Score: 67)\nMUST NOT provide responses that could facilitate SIM swapping or subscriber identity theft, instead offering identity verification strengthening measures and account protection strategies.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 37e9ee776edf, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically sanitize output containing network topology details, IP address ranges, or infrastructure vulnerability information that could enable unauthorized access.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 26fdfdb1ea7b, Score: 61)\nSHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic references instead of precise locations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 08e209c09474, Score: 66)\nSHOULD detect when troubleshooting guidance involves safety-critical systems and automatically include relevant safety warnings and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3da4a041cf44, Score: 67)\nMUST detect potential security vulnerabilities in suggested network configurations and either provide hardened alternatives or clearly identify risk mitigation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: cbc4f2f65d80, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT provide fiber optic network actions without confirming cable specifications, connector types, and power budget calculations are within safe operating parameters.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 63395a04e36e, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT execute responses that could compromise emergency communication services or public safety networks, instead redirecting to approved coordination procedures.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
