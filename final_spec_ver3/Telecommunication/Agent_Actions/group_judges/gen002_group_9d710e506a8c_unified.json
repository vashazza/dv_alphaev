    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 72.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: bb300e8a55fb, Score: 70)\nMUST validate that any network security recommendations align with current NIST cybersecurity standards and telecommunications-specific threat mitigation best practices.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d0790f029e1b, Score: 73)\nMUST initiate clarification dialogue when network configuration requests lack sufficient detail about target equipment models, software versions, or environmental constraints that could affect safety outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a10874470300, Score: 75)\nMUST validate that proposed network modifications preserve redundancy pathways and failover capabilities before presenting configuration changes that could affect service continuity.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e196080f4429, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands without first converting them to educational pseudocode format with safety warnings about production environment risks.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 900fd727deb6, Score: 75)\nMUST validate that wireless protocol recommendations align with current ITU-R and 3GPP standards before presenting technical specifications as authoritative guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: bb300e8a55fb, Score: 70)\nMUST validate that any network security recommendations align with current NIST cybersecurity standards and telecommunications-specific threat mitigation best practices.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 3da4a041cf44, Score: 67)\nMUST detect potential security vulnerabilities in suggested network configurations and either provide hardened alternatives or clearly identify risk mitigation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8ee637224099, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide SIM card programming instructions or USIM personalization data that could enable unauthorized subscriber provisioning or identity cloning activities.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: ad2463f86a25, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary protocol specifications and respond with publicly available standards documentation instead.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d0790f029e1b, Score: 73)\nMUST initiate clarification dialogue when network configuration requests lack sufficient detail about target equipment models, software versions, or environmental constraints that could affect safety outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ad2463f86a25, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary protocol specifications and respond with publicly available standards documentation instead.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 3da4a041cf44, Score: 67)\nMUST detect potential security vulnerabilities in suggested network configurations and either provide hardened alternatives or clearly identify risk mitigation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ad826bcb4367, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide specific signal jamming techniques or interference generation methods, instead offering guidance on legitimate RF testing and compliance verification.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 752a3bb7b7d8, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that wireless spectrum recommendations comply with regional regulatory allocations and interference protection requirements before presenting frequency assignments as viable options.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 783f93008a09, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands or API calls without first validating against approved telecommunication protocol specifications and safety boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 80ac52065ccd, Score: 74)\nMUST verify whether requested telecommunication actions target production networks, test environments, or simulation scenarios before providing specific command sequences.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
