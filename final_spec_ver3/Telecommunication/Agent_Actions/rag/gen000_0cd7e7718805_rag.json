    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of telecommunication security, such as data sanitization, compliance with standards, and protection against unauthorized access. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated specification (SPEC 2 and SPEC 12), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of telecommunication security concerns, from general principles like compliance with standards to specific issues like masking PII and preventing unauthorized access. The mix of general and specific rules is well-balanced, though there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification (SPEC 2 and SPEC 12), which could be consolidated. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules could be overly specific, such as those focusing on particular protocols or scenarios, which might limit their applicability in broader contexts."
