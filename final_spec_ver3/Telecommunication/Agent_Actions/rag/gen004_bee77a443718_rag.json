    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting potentially harmful requests to legitimate practices and ensuring compliance with standards. However, there could be more explicit links between some specs to enhance cohesion further.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, from adversarial prompts to unauthorized access and spectrum usage. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SIM swapping and social engineering. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging threats or new technologies in telecommunications.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly in areas like unauthorized access and fraud prevention. While this redundancy can enhance robustness, it could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, but some consolidation could improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidance on legitimate practices and compliance. However, some specs could be overly specific, potentially limiting their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
