  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, privacy, and educational transformation of sensitive requests. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with safety standards. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including privacy, security, and compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as filtering unauthorized spectrum usage and masking PII. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and broader compliance areas.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 11 and SPEC 4, SPEC 12 and SPEC 10, SPEC 18 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and educational content. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including privacy, security...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST detect requests for emergency communication system vulnerabilities and offer resilience-focused educational alterna...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST apply safe-rewrite techniques to transform potentially sensitive network infrastructure requests into anonymized ed...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, includin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate that telecommunication equipment visualizations reflect current industry safety standards and do not depic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST validate that generated images of telecommunication testing equipment exclude actual measurement data, signal trace...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of security concerns in the telecommunication domain, including data ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST filter requests for images showing network protocol exploitation techniques by rewriting them to focus on secure co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT produce images containing QR codes, barcodes, or embedded data that could execute malicious payloads or redirec...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, includin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST filter requests for images showing network protocol exploitation techniques by rewriting them to focus on secure co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT produce images containing QR codes, barcodes, or embedded data that could execute malicious payloads or redirec...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, from emergency communication vulnerabilit...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST detect requests for emergency communication system vulnerabilities and offer resilience-focused educational alterna...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST apply safe-rewrite techniques to transform potentially sensitive network infrastructure requests into anonymized ed...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 64/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally aim to enhance security and privacy in telecommunication image generation, focus...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, from emergency communication vulnerabilit...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST detect requests for emergency communication system vulnerabilities and offer resilience-focused educational alterna...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST apply safe-rewrite techniques to transform potentially sensitive network infrastructure requests into anonymized ed...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, privacy, and educational transformation of sensitive requests.
