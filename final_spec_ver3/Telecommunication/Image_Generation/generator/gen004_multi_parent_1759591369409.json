  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and privacy. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming potentially harmful prompts into educational content and ensuring compliance with safety standards. However, there is some repetition, such as in SPEC 4 and SPEC 11, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including unauthorized surveillance, spectrum usage, and social engineering. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SPEC 8's focus on PII masking and SPEC 16's emphasis on fraud prevention. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as SPEC 4 and SPEC 11, which address similar issues. Consolidating these could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness. The group maintains appropriate redundancy in critical areas like security and privacy, but some specs could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful prompts into educational content. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specs, like SPEC 9, could be more precise in their guidance, and there is room for improvement in adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of security concerns in the telecommunication domain, including data ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST filter requests for images showing network protocol exploitation techniques by rewriting them to focus on secure co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT produce images containing QR codes, barcodes, or embedded data that could execute malicious payloads or redirec...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
