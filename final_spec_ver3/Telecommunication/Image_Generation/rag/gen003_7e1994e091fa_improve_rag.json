    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, privacy, and educational transformation of sensitive requests. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with safety standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 11 and SPEC 4) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including emergency communication, network security, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as illegal signal amplification and unauthorized spectrum usage. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or digital transformation challenges.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 11 and SPEC 4, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 17 and SPEC 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with safety standards. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific and could be more flexible to cover multiple use cases."
