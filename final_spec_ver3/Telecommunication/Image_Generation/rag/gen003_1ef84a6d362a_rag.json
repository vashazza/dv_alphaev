    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, privacy, and educational transformation of sensitive requests. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with safety standards. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including privacy, security, and compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as filtering unauthorized spectrum usage and masking PII. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and broader compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 2, SPEC 11 and SPEC 4, SPEC 12 and SPEC 10, SPEC 18 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and educational content. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts."
