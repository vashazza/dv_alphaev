    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications safety and compliance. They address various aspects of data protection, bias detection, and security, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 19), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including data protection, network security, and performance analysis. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as regulatory compliance and user privacy beyond PII, could be more comprehensively addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 19). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular technical details, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
