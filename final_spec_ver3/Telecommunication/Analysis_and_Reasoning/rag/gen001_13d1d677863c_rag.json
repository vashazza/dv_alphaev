    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They cover various aspects of telecommunications analysis, such as protocol compliance, network performance, and security, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like network performance and security that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas such as protocol compliance, network security, and performance analysis. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and newer compliance challenges, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some redundancy, particularly in network performance and security analysis, it is generally appropriate for critical safety areas. Some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap, but the redundancy does not significantly detract from the overall efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific and could be more flexible to cover broader scenarios. This slightly impacts their practicality in real-world applications."
