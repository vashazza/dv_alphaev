Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications safety and compliance. They address various aspects of data protection, bias detection, and security, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 19), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including data protection, network security, and performance analysis. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as regulatory compliance and user privacy beyond PII, could be more comprehensively addressed..

They address various aspects of data protection, bias detection, and security, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 19), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including data protection, network security, and performance analysis. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as regulatory compliance and user privacy beyond PII, could be more comprehensively addressed.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 19). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular technical details, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device identifiers,...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identifiers, network authentication cred...\n  - [3] (Score: 65) SHOULD apply bias detection when analyzing network performance disparities across different geograph...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
