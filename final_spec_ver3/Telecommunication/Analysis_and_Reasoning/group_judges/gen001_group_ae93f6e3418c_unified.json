    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add robustness and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability.
