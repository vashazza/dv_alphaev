    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of telecommunications analysis, such as frequency coordination, network performance, and security, without apparent conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and verifying compliance with standards, contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including network security, performance analysis, and regulatory compliance. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as encryption standards and emergency communication systems. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel threats that could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 16, SPEC 14 and SPEC 17, SPEC 7 and SPEC 18, SPEC 3 and SPEC 19), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, the repetition of similar rules suggests room for streamlining without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as international treaty obligations and cryptographic standards. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=79",
