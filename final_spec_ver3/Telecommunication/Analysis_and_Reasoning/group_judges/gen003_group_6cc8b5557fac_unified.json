    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

about protocol compatibility, equipment interoperability, or standards compliance assessments.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1c6f6b318264, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning chains that could enable

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of telecommunications analysis, such as data privacy, security, and analytical integrity. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on protecting sensitive information and ensuring accurate analytical conclusions. However, there is some redundancy, particularly in the repeated emphasis on masking PII, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including data privacy, security, and analytical accuracy. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring legitimate use of network vulnerability information. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or evolving threats, which could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly regarding the repeated emphasis on masking PII and preventing unauthorized access. While these are critical areas, the repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The redundancy in bias detection and logical reasoning chains also suggests potential for consolidation. However, the redundancy does provide robustness in critical safety areas.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can be adapted to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular analytical methodologies, which could limit their applicability.
