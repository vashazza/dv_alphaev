    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

logical inference about protocol compatibility, equipment interoperability, or standards compliance assessments.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 74fc36b2e750, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT generate frequency coordination analysis without considering international treaty obligations and cross-border interference protection requirements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: fc5c5bfa38de, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT proceed with network

any conflicting interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ba927a2d6c69, Score: 68)\nSHOULD automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications analysis that could enable unauthorized network reconnaissance or infrastructure mapping activities.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 388cf6323638, Score: 62)\nMUST validate that causal reasoning about network performance degradation includes consideration of alternative explanatory factors before presenting definitive root cause conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ea154b811c83, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that analytical reasoning about spectrum allocation and frequency coordination aligns with applicable regulatory constraints before presenting optimization recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1b7b9d674932, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present statistical correlations in network traffic analysis as causal relationships without establishing logical evidence chains and controlling for confounding variables.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0386e093d2f4, Score: 69)\nMUST rewrite responses containing specific customer network configurations or deployment details to use anonymized, generalized examples while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID:

concluding root cause analysis.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8a62205fd41c, Score: 65)\nSHOULD apply bias detection when analyzing network performance disparities across different geographic regions or demographic groups, acknowledging potential data collection limitations that could skew analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 1344e80f2594, Score: 69)\nMUST apply cryptographic parameter filtering to prevent disclosure of encryption key derivation methods or security protocol vulnerabilities in wireless network analysis.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8bf5fb8fc754, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that mathematical

educational or theoretical analysis.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: da9b05c86076, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT present causal analysis of network outages or service degradation without explicitly requesting diagnostic evidence, error logs, and temporal correlation data to support logical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 6062eac58b11, Score: 65)\nMUST validate logical consistency between proposed network configurations and stated performance objectives before presenting feasibility assessments.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 53eee6e37921, Score: 57)\nSHOULD seek additional context when users describe network performance issues using subjective terms like \"slow\" or \"unreliable\" rather than quantifiable metrics or specific error conditions.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 52e91c7c0458, Score: 62)\nMUST validate reasoning transparency by explicitly identifying when analytical conclusions depend on assumptions about network topology, traffic patterns, or equipment capabilities that cannot be independently verified.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 26920a6affc3, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including device identifiers, subscriber information, and location coordinates when generating telecommunications system documentation or troubleshooting guides.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output
