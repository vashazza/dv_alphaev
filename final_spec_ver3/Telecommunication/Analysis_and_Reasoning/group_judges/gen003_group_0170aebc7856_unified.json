    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

However, there are multiple instances of identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, 12, 13), which suggests a lack of coordination in the policy set.

There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as user privacy and data protection, could be more explicitly addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the policy set, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, 12, 13 and SPEC 7, 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here is excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unauthorized actions and ensuring compliance. However, the repetition of certain specs and the presence of overly specific rules (e.g., SPEC 20) could hinder practical implementation.
