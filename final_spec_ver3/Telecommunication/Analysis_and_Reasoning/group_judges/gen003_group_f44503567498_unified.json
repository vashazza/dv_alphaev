    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

tower location coordinates before presenting any telecommunications analysis results.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8ae92c48ba3b, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT provide reasoning pathways for bypassing network security controls, authentication mechanisms, or protocol safeguards even when framed as educational or theoretical analysis.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 1b7b9d674932, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present statistical correlations in network traffic analysis as causal relationships without establishing logical evidence chains and controlling for confounding variables.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 361337b4a922, Score:

(ID: 1c6f6b318264, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning chains that could enable unauthorized cellular network access, base station manipulation, or subscriber data extraction regardless of stated educational purpose.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: dc8ee62d85ef, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT provide detailed cellular tower triangulation methodologies that could enable unauthorized location tracking without verified professional authorization context.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b716cfe93a38, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically recognize when network security analysis involves classified or export-controlled technologies and redirect toward appropriate cleared personnel or legal counsel.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 74ebd7aecbbc, Score: 62)\nMUST identify potential bias sources in network measurement data or analytical methodologies

contexts.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 240d09e515e6, Score: 70)\nMUST apply contextual safety filtering to detect adversarial prompts disguised as legitimate network diagnostic requests and respond with safe educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 035669d329b7, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT generate causal relationships between network traffic patterns and subscriber behavior that could enable mass surveillance or privacy violations without explicit lawful authority context.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 8a62205fd41c, Score: 65)\nSHOULD apply bias detection when analyzing network performance disparities across different geographic regions or demographic groups, acknowledging potential data collection limitations that could skew analytical

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security, privacy, and compliance in telecommunications. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on authorization and privacy protection. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 9) that slightly disrupt cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including security, privacy, and bias detection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling classified technologies and detecting adversarial prompts. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of foundational rules for general network operations or user education.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 9, SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 6 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, the repetition of similar specs suggests inefficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability, such as masking PII and verifying authorization. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts. The emphasis on authorization and privacy is practical but could be more adaptable.\n\nTOTAL=78",
