    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=20  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework focused on security and compliance in telecommunications. However, there are multiple instances of identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19), which suggests a lack of diversity in addressing different aspects of the domain. This repetition detracts from the overall cohesion as it indicates a narrow focus rather than a broad, interconnected strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers several important areas such as regulatory compliance, unauthorized access prevention, and network security. However, the heavy repetition of certain specs limits the breadth of coverage. While there is a mix of general principles and specific edge cases, the overemphasis on certain specs suggests potential gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas within telecommunications.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=10  \nComment: There is significant redundancy due to the repeated inclusion of identical specs. This repetition does not contribute to robustness but rather indicates inefficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent seen here is excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance.
