    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security, compliance, and operational integrity within the telecommunications domain. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1, SPEC 13 and SPEC 11, SPEC 16 and SPEC 4, SPEC 18 and SPEC 3, SPEC 19 and SPEC 8), which slightly disrupt the logical flow and cohesion of the policy set.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including network security, classification accuracy, and compliance with standards. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency services and dual-use technologies. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and broader regulatory frameworks that could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with several specifications being repeated verbatim, which indicates inefficiency in the policy set. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve clarity and efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules applicable to various scenarios.
