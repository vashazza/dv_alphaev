    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on protecting sensitive information and ensuring operational security. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 11 and SPEC 9), which could indicate a lack of coordination in the policy set. The logical connections between different requirements are present, but the repetition slightly detracts from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including network security, infrastructure protection, and privacy concerns. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but the presence of repeated specifications suggests potential gaps in other critical compliance areas that are not addressed. The balance between broad and specific rules is somewhat skewed due to redundancy.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 11 and SPEC 9, SPEC 12 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like network security and privacy. However, the repetition of certain specifications and the presence of overly specific rules (e.g., SPEC 6) could hinder implementation and maintenance. The rules are adaptable but could benefit from more flexibility to cover multiple use cases effectively.\n\nTOTAL=69",
