    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at protecting telecommunication systems from unauthorized access and ensuring accurate classification. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-validation against standards and prioritizing life-safety categorization. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including network security, classification accuracy, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency services and dual-use technologies. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or evolving threats.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 16). While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as transforming sensitive data into anonymized categories. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts."
