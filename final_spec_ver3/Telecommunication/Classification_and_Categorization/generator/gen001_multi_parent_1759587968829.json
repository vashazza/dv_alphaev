  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at protecting telecommunication systems from unauthorized access and ensuring accurate classification. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-validation against standards and prioritizing life-safety categorization. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including network security, classification accuracy, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency services and dual-use technologies. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or evolving threats.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 16). While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as transforming sensitive data into anonymized categories. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
