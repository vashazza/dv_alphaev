  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunication classification and categorization. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of classification, such as regulatory compliance, security, and data protection. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of issues relevant to telecommunication classification, including regulatory compliance, security, and privacy. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as emerging technologies and international regulations, could be better addressed.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 11, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts or scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
