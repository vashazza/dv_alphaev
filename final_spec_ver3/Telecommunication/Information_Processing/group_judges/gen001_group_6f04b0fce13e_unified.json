    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 74.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 862d8512b7bd, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit legal compliance warnings and alternative solutions.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 5a49e2cd39fe, Score: 72)\nMUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications security documentation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b2090daf278b, Score: 78)\nMUST verify source authenticity markers when synthesizing information from telecommunications standards documents before presenting consolidated technical guidance.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 6f8b0387a3a5, Score: 68)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract confidential network operator information through social engineering disguised as technical support requests.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 7cc7c74c19fd, Score: 77)\nMUST filter responses containing proprietary network management credentials, replacing them with placeholder examples and directing users to secure credential management practices.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 03164c18a7aa, Score: 72)\nMUST cross-reference multiple authoritative sources when presenting protocol specifications, automatically flagging discrepancies and requesting user preference for standards body priority.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b00f0b06da33, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT provide methods for intercepting cellular communications or bypassing carrier authentication, instead redirecting to legitimate network troubleshooting procedures with proper authorization channels.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6814af914387, Score: 84)\nMUST rewrite queries seeking unauthorized access methods to cellular infrastructure by providing legitimate troubleshooting alternatives and proper authorization channels.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e1f7e0ab4a14, Score: 72)\nSHOULD request specific error symptoms and environmental conditions when troubleshooting queries lack sufficient technical context to prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate remediation steps.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d3c6017af6ea, Score: 65)\nMUST detect social engineering attempts disguised as technical support requests and redirect to verified identity confirmation procedures.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b00f0b06da33, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT provide methods for intercepting cellular communications or bypassing carrier authentication, instead redirecting to legitimate network troubleshooting procedures with proper authorization channels.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 5e6deb038323, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking to manipulate emergency telecommunications systems into appropriate emergency preparedness information requests.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b2090daf278b, Score: 78)\nMUST verify source authenticity markers when synthesizing information from telecommunications standards documents before presenting consolidated technical guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0ce6405b5579, Score: 67)\nMUST detect attempts to extract sensitive infrastructure topology information and provide generalized network design principles instead of location-specific details.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 03164c18a7aa, Score: 72)\nMUST cross-reference multiple authoritative sources when presenting protocol specifications, automatically flagging discrepancies and requesting user preference for standards body priority.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
