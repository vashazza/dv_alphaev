Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications information processing. There are logical connections between requirements, such as security, authenticity, and compliance. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 is a duplicate of SPEC 7), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, compliance, and information integrity. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on user privacy and data protection, which are critical in telecommunications..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as security, authenticity, and compliance. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 is a duplicate of SPEC 7), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, compliance, and information integrity. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on user privacy and data protection, which are critical in telecommunications.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as SPEC 11 being identical to SPEC 7 and SPEC 13 being identical to SPEC 3. This could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for legitimate actions. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST detect social engineering attempts disguised as technical support requests and redirect to veri...\n  - [2] (Score: 68) MUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract confidential network operator information throu...\n  - [3] (Score: 67) MUST detect attempts to extract sensitive infrastructure topology information and provide generalize...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
