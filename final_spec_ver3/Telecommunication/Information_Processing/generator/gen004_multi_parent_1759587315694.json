  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security and compliance in telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of security, such as preventing unauthorized access, ensuring compliance, and protecting proprietary information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications security concerns, including cryptographic key protection, fraud prevention, protocol exploitation, and emergency communication compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or broader regulatory compliance beyond security.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14) that could be consolidated. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unauthorized activities and ensuring compliance. They are adaptable to different contexts within telecommunications. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly affecting practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including privacy, security,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD redirect requests for subscriber location tracking methods toward privacy-compliant location services with explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that could trigger unintend...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommuni...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including fraudulent documentation, network security, and d...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent network certification documentation and redirect to legitimate testing labor...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST cross-reference equipment specifications against manufacturer safety bulletins and known vulnerability databases be...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including unauthorized access, social engineering, and info...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, security, and regula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD redirect requests for subscriber location tracking methods toward privacy-compliant location services with explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that could trigger unintend...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including security, privacy, and compliance, with ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT provide detailed procedures for exploiting SS7 or Diameter protocol weaknesses without redirecting to authorize...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 69/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, privacy, and complia...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT provide detailed procedures for exploiting SS7 or Diameter protocol weaknesses without redirecting to authorize...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security and compliance in telecommunications.
