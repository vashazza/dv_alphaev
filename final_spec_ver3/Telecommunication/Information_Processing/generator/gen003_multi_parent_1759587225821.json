  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing unauthorized access and manipulation within telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as cryptographic material protection, fraud prevention, and network integrity. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications security, including cryptographic protection, fraud prevention, and network integrity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SIM card cloning and signal jamming. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging threats and broader compliance areas, which could be improved.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5, 9, 10, 11, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could improve the policy set's efficiency without sacrificing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unauthorized activities while promoting legitimate practices. They balance security with usability by redirecting potentially harmful requests to authorized procedures. However, the repetition of certain specs and some overly specific rules could hinder adaptability and implementation in diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommuni...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including security, compli...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications security, including cryptogra...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including privacy, security,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD redirect requests for subscriber location tracking methods toward privacy-compliant location services with explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that could trigger unintend...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, compliance, and info...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, privacy, and complia...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, security, and regula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD redirect requests for subscriber location tracking methods toward privacy-compliant location services with explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that could trigger unintend...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing unauthorized access and manipulation within telecommunications.
