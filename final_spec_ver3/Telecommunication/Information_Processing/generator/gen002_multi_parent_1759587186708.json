  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on privacy, security, and compliance in telecommunications. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy-compliant location tracking and the redaction of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion, such as aligning the privacy and security measures more explicitly.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as unauthorized tracking and emergency system manipulation. However, there are minor gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies and their associated risks.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to cryptographic key material redaction. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could be simplified to enhance practicality. For example, the focus on specific unauthorized tracking methods could be broadened to cover a wider range of privacy concerns..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, compliance, and info...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on privacy, se...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, security, and regulatory compli...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD redirect requests for subscriber location tracking methods toward privacy-compliant location services with explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that could trigger unintend...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommuni...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including security, compli...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on fraud detection, security compliance, a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of issues, including fraud detection, security compliance, and user g...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent network certification documentation and redirect to legitimate testing labor...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST cross-reference equipment specifications against manufacturer safety bulletins and known vulnerability databases be...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications security concerns, including cryptographic key ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, compliance, and info...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on privacy, security, and compliance in telecommunications.
