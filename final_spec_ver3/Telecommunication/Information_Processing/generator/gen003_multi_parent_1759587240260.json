  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on fraud detection, security compliance, and user guidance. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 11 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The specs address different aspects of telecommunications security and compliance, forming a coherent strategy, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of issues, including fraud detection, security compliance, and user guidance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as social engineering and spectrum allocation. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific compliance areas like data protection laws.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., fraudulent documentation detection and social engineering). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition of entire specs suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could improve the overall robustness without unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like fraud detection and security compliance. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring cross-referencing with specific databases or standards, which may limit flexibility. More broadly applicable rules could enhance adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommuni...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including security, compli...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications security, including cryptogra...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including privacy, security,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD redirect requests for subscriber location tracking methods toward privacy-compliant location services with explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that could trigger unintend...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, compliance, and info...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate cellular signal amplification guidance that could violate power output regulations without explicit le...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including security, privacy, and complia...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect and redact cryptographic key material or authentication credentials when processing telecommunications secur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, security, and regula...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD redirect requests for subscriber location tracking methods toward privacy-compliant location services with explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that could trigger unintend...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on fraud detection, security compliance, and user guidance.
