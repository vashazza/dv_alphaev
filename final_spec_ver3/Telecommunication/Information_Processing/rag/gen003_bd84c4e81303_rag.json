    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, focusing on fraud detection, security compliance, and user guidance. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 11 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The specs address different aspects of telecommunications security and compliance, forming a coherent strategy, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of issues, including fraud detection, security compliance, and user guidance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as social engineering and spectrum allocation. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific compliance areas like data protection laws.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., fraudulent documentation detection and social engineering). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition of entire specs suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could improve the overall robustness without unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like fraud detection and security compliance. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring cross-referencing with specific databases or standards, which may limit flexibility. More broadly applicable rules could enhance adaptability across different contexts."
