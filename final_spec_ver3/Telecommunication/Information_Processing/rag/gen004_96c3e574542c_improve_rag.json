    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on privacy, security, and compliance in telecommunications. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy-compliant location tracking and the redaction of sensitive information. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in privacy-related specs, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized tracking and emergency telecommunications manipulation. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific cybersecurity threats beyond cryptographic key protection.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs related to privacy-compliant location tracking (SPEC 1 and SPEC 7) and the duplication of SPEC 10 and SPEC 12. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these overlaps could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as through privacy-compliant redirection and information masking. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts, such as SPEC 15's focus on network capacity planning."
