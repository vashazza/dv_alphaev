    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing unauthorized access and manipulation within telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as cryptographic material protection, fraud prevention, and network integrity. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications security, including cryptographic protection, fraud prevention, and network integrity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SIM card cloning and signal jamming. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging threats and broader compliance areas, which could be improved.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5, 9, 10, 11, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could improve the policy set's efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unauthorized activities while promoting legitimate practices. They balance security with usability by redirecting potentially harmful requests to authorized procedures. However, the repetition of certain specs and some overly specific rules could hinder adaptability and implementation in diverse contexts."
