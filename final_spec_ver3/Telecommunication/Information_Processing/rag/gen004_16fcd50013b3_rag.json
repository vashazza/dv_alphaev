    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security and compliance in telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of security, such as preventing unauthorized access, ensuring compliance, and protecting proprietary information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of telecommunications security concerns, including cryptographic key protection, fraud prevention, protocol exploitation, and emergency communication compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or broader regulatory compliance beyond security.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14) that could be consolidated. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unauthorized activities and ensuring compliance. They are adaptable to different contexts within telecommunications. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly affecting practicality."
