    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on privacy, security, and compliance in telecommunications. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy-compliant location tracking and the redaction of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion, such as aligning the privacy and security measures more explicitly.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as unauthorized tracking and emergency system manipulation. However, there are minor gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies and their associated risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to cryptographic key material redaction. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could be simplified to enhance practicality. For example, the focus on specific unauthorized tracking methods could be broadened to cover a wider range of privacy concerns."
