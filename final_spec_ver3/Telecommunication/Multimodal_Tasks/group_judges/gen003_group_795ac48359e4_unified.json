    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on preventing unauthorized access and misuse of telecommunications data. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 2, SPEC 7 and SPEC 1), which could indicate a lack of cohesion in terms of unique contributions. The specs do form a coherent strategy for safety and compliance, but the repetition slightly detracts from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including unauthorized data access, privacy protection, and misuse of emergency communication systems. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests potential gaps in addressing other critical areas that could have been covered instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing specific risks in telecommunications. They balance security with usability, but the repetition of certain specs suggests a lack of flexibility and adaptability. More broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality by covering multiple scenarios without needing repetition.\n\nTOTAL=73",
