    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of telecommunications security, such as multimodal content generation, emergency communication protocols, and personal data protection. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 2), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including multimodal content security, emergency protocols, and personal data protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or evolving threats. The coverage could be improved by addressing these areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 6). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could be more streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=79",
