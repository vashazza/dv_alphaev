    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for managing multimodal tasks in telecommunications. They address various aspects of safety and compliance, such as user qualification, content verification, and information masking. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 3, SPEC 16 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunications, including critical infrastructure, emergency services, and personal data protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as preventing unauthorized network mapping and deepfake content. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 3, SPEC 16 and SPEC 15, SPEC 19 and SPEC 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical measures like verifying user qualifications and ensuring content consistency.
