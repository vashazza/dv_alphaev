    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of multimodal tasks, such as user qualification, content verification, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 8, SPEC 2 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including infrastructure protection, user verification, and data security. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing unauthorized network mapping and ensuring cross-modal consistency. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 8, SPEC 2 and SPEC 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across various scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=81",
