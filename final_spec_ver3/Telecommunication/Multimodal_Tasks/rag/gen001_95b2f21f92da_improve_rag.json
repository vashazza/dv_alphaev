    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications safety and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as verifying user qualifications and ensuring content consistency across modalities. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including infrastructure protection, content verification, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and broader cybersecurity threats.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, with certain specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 3 and 9, Specs 7 and 13, Specs 11 and 2). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, though some rules are overly specific, which could limit flexibility. The policies are adaptable to different contexts, but further simplification could enhance practicality."
