    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications security and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 3, and 7) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including unauthorized access, regulatory compliance, and sensitive information protection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deprecated protocols and verifying technical claims. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2, 3, and 7; SPEC 8 and 9; SPEC 15 and 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory environments and technical roles. However, some specifications could be overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability in broader scenarios."
