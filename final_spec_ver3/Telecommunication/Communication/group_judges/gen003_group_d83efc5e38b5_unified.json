    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on security and compliance in telecommunications. However, there are multiple instances of redundancy, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9) and similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 2, 7, 17, and 18), which suggest a lack of cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are present but could be more streamlined to form a more coherent strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including unauthorized access, regulatory compliance, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cross-border inquiries and high-voltage equipment discussions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or digital privacy beyond PII masking.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=12  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specs, with multiple instances of identical or nearly identical requirements (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 9 and SPEC 2, 7, 17, 18). While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to improve robustness without waste.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. However, the presence of overly specific rules and repeated specs reduces practicality. The rules are adaptable to different contexts, but the redundancy and specificity could hinder real-world implementation and maintenance.\n\nTOTAL=65",
