    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety, security, and compliance in telecommunications. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 1, SPEC 18 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are mostly clear, but the presence of duplicates suggests some lack of integration.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including network security, privacy, regulatory compliance, and safety protocols. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the presence of repeated specifications indicates potential gaps in addressing other critical areas that could have been covered instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some unnecessary duplication in the specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 1, SPEC 18 and SPEC 17), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repeated specs suggest inefficiency rather than intentional reinforcement.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. However, some specifications are overly specific and may not be adaptable to different contexts, such as those focusing on very particular scenarios (e.g., SPEC 16 on cross-border inquiries). More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=75",
