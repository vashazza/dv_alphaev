    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of telecommunications security and compliance, such as privacy protection, regulatory adherence, and fraud prevention. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on verifying user authorization and redirecting to legitimate resources. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including privacy, security, regulatory compliance, and fraud. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as handling requests for sensitive information and ensuring compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations. However, there could be more foundational rules to support the specific cases, and some critical areas like data encryption and user authentication are not explicitly covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 12, SPEC 10 and SPEC 13, SPEC 4 and SPEC 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation, such as verifying user authorization and redirecting to appropriate resources. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring compliance. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
