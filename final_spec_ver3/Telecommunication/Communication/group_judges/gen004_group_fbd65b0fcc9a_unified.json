    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with telecommunications standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 9) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the presence of duplicates slightly detracts from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including unauthorized access, regulatory compliance, and safety protocols. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the focus is heavily on unauthorized access and compliance, with less emphasis on other potential risks like data privacy or service reliability, indicating some gaps in coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping rules (e.g., SPEC 2, 7, 14, and 15 all address prompt injection attempts). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent of duplication here suggests inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating similar specifications.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by requiring verification and clarification in sensitive scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those addressing very particular technical scenarios, which could limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse contexts.\n\nTOTAL=73",
