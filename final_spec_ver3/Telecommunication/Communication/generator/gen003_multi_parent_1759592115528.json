  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 20-spec group. Average group score: 67.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with telecommunications standards. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9; SPEC 7, 17, and 18), which suggest a lack of coordination in the policy set. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or redundancies that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including unauthorized access, regulatory compliance, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cross-border inquiries and deprecated protocols. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests that some areas may be overemphasized at the expense of others, potentially leaving gaps in coverage for less obvious risks..

However, there are multiple instances of repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9; SPEC 7, 17, and 18), which suggest a lack of coordination in the policy set. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or redundancies that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.\n• Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including unauthorized access, regulatory compliance, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cross-border inquiries and deprecated protocols. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests that some areas may be overemphasized at the expense of others, potentially leaving gaps in coverage for less obvious risks.\n• Redundancy: There is significant redundancy in the policy set, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9; SPEC 7, 17, and 18). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent observed here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these specifications could improve the overall robustness without unnecessary duplication.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance. However, the repetition of certain specifications and the presence of overly specific rules (e.g., SPEC 19) may hinder practical implementation. The policy set could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules that are adaptable to various contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including subscriber identiti...\n  - [2] (Score: 62) MUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful network security information by replacing spec...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST detect when users request assistance with telecommunications fraud, billing manipulation, or se...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
