    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security and compliance in telecommunications code generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of security, such as authentication, privacy, and vulnerability prevention. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1, 5, and 19), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of security concerns, from general principles like cryptographic standards to specific edge cases like preventing rogue base stations. The balance between general rules and specific protections is well-maintained, but there could be more emphasis on emerging threats or technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1, 5, and 19), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can be adapted to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
