    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunications code generation, such as security, compliance, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including PII protection, protocol security, lawful communication interception, and emergency services. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some areas could be more comprehensively addressed, such as broader network security measures.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for compliance. However, the repetition of certain rules may complicate implementation and maintenance."
