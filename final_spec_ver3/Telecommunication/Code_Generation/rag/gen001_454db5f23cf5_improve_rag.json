    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommunications code generation. They address various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, such as PII masking, lawful communication interception, and network safety. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including PII protection, network security, lawful communication, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized spectrum usage and rogue base station creation. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel threats, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeating similar requirements (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating overlapping specs could improve clarity and reduce unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for lawful and compliant code generation. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
