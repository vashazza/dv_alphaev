Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes security and ethical code generation practices. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as focusing on authentication, privacy, and preventing malicious code generation. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunication code generation, including authentication, privacy, and security. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing replay attacks and ensuring privacy in location tracking.

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as focusing on authentication, privacy, and preventing malicious code generation. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunication code generation, including authentication, privacy, and security. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing replay attacks and ensuring privacy in location tracking. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies and threats comprehensively.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and privacy. They are adaptable to different contexts and balance security with usability. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 67) SHOULD cross-reference generated 5G network slicing code against GSMA security guidelines and includ...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST verify that generated network authentication code uses current cryptographic standards and avoi...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate code for unauthorized network penetration testing or vulnerability exploitation, i...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
