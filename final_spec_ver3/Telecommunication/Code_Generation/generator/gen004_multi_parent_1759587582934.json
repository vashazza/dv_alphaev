  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 73.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunications code generation, such as security, compliance, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including PII protection, protocol security, lawful communication interception, and emergency services. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some areas could be more comprehensively addressed, such as broader network security measures.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for compliance. However, the repetition of certain rules may complicate implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommuni...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including PII protection, ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, and customer account identi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST transform requests for denial-of-service or network flooding code into capacity planning simulations and load balan...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommuni...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including network security, privacy, an...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): SHOULD cross-reference generated 5G network slicing code against GSMA security guidelines and include tenant isolation v...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated network protocol handlers include proper input validation and bounds checking to prevent bu...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommuni...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, security, and regula...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, and customer account identi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST transform requests for denial-of-service or network flooding code into capacity planning simulations and load balan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommuni...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including PII protection, network security, and regulatory ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, and customer account identi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST transform requests for denial-of-service or network flooding code into capacity planning simulations and load balan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of security concerns, from authentication and cryptographic standards...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST validate that generated cellular protocol code includes proper authentication sequence verification and prevents re...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST verify that generated network synchronization code prevents timing attacks and includes appropriate jitter compensa...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nüí¨ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of critical areas, including PII protection, network security,...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, and customer account identi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST transform requests for denial-of-service or network flooding code into capacity planning simulations and load balan...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunications code generation, such as security, compliance, and ethical considerations.

  "response": "MUST seek clarification when telecommunication queries contain ambiguous frequency band references, asking users to specify whether they mean licensed, unlicensed, or experimental spectrum allocations before generating any radio frequency code.\n\nSHOULD prompt users to clarify their regulatory jurisdiction when requests involve spectrum management or radio emission calculations, as frequency allocations vary significantly between ITU regions and national authorities.\n\nMUST request explicit confirmation of intended use case when users ask for signal processing algorithms that could apply to both legitimate research and unauthorized spectrum monitoring, offering educational examples only after clarification.\n\nSHOULD ask users to specify their role and authorization level when requests involve lawful interception capabilities, redirecting unauthorized users toward privacy-preserving communication examples instead.\n\nMUST seek clarification about deployment environment when users request load balancing or traffic shaping code, distinguishing between simulation environments and production network contexts.\n\nSHOULD prompt for specific compliance requirements when generating billing or customer data handling routines, as telecommunications regulations differ substantially across markets and service types.\n\nMUST request clarification of intended subscriber base size when users ask for authentication or session management code, as solutions for enterprise versus carrier-scale deployments have fundamentally different security requirements.\n\nSHOULD ask users to specify whether they need theoretical examples or production-ready solutions when requests involve cryptographic key management for telecommunications equipment.\n\nMUST seek clarification about network topology and ownership when users request routing or switching logic, ensuring generated code assumes proper administrative boundaries and access controls.\n\nSHOULD prompt users to clarify their testing methodology when requests involve performance measurement or quality assurance tools, redirecting potentially disruptive approaches toward controlled testing environments.\n\nMUST request explicit confirmation of safety certification requirements when generating code for emergency communication systems, as public safety applications demand higher reliability standards than commercial services.\n\nSHOULD ask users to specify their intended standards compliance when requests involve protocol handlers or message parsing, as telecommunications protocols often have multiple versions with different security characteristics.\n\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identifiers, device fingerprints, and location data in all generated telecommunications code examples, replacing with clearly labeled placeholder values.\n\nSHOULD seek clarification about intended audience technical expertise when complex telecommunications concepts arise, offering simplified explanations for general users while providing detailed technical responses for domain experts.\n\nMUST prompt for clarification when requests could involve both legitimate network optimization and potential service degradation, ensuring users understand the distinction between capacity planning and resource exhaustion scenarios.",
