They address various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, such as PII masking, lawful communication interception, and network safety. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including PII protection, network security, lawful compliance, and ethical code generation. The mix of general principles and specific edge cases is well-balanced, though there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies and evolving threats.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly in specifications related to PII masking and network configuration prompts. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for compliant code generation. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit adaptability across different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including subscriber identifi...\n  - [2] (Score: 73) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, and cus...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST detect requests for code that could disrupt emergency communication services and redirect towar...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
