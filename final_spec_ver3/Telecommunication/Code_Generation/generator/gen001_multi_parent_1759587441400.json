Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommunications code generation. They address various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, such as PII masking, lawful communication interception, and network safety. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including PII protection, network security, lawful communication, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized spectrum usage and rogue base station creation. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel threats, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.. Target Spec: MUST sanitize generated code examples by replacing actual network topology references with anonymize...

They address various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, such as PII masking, lawful communication interception, and network safety. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including PII protection, network security, lawful communication, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized spectrum usage and rogue base station creation. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel threats, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeating similar requirements (e.g., PII masking and protocol handling). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating overlapping specs could improve clarity and reduce unnecessary duplication.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for lawful and compliant code generation. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST sanitize generated code examples by replacing actual network topology references with anonymize...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate code for unauthorized network penetration testing or vulnerability exploitation, i...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST NOT generate code for unauthorized spectrum usage, frequency hopping outside licensed bands, or...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
