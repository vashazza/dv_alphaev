    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security and compliance in telecommunications code generation. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 11 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration in the policy set.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including PII protection, lawful communication interception, and spectrum usage. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as frequency boundary checks and emergency communication disruptions. However, the presence of repeated specs indicates potential gaps in addressing other unique compliance areas that could have been covered instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the policy set, with several specs being repeated verbatim. This suggests inefficiency and a lack of consolidation, which could have been improved by merging similar requirements. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the extent here is excessive and could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like masking PII and ensuring lawful communication practices. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts.
