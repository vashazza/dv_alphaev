    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of telecommunications safety and compliance, such as security, regulatory adherence, and responsible content generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting inappropriate requests to legitimate resources and ensuring compliance with current standards. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including security vulnerabilities, regulatory compliance, and unauthorized access. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing SIM swapping and SS7 exploitation. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and threats to ensure no critical compliance areas are overlooked.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 8 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests and ensuring compliance with current standards. They balance security with usability by providing guidance toward legitimate resources. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
