    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description:

74.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e17e4c29666e, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that generated telecommunications compliance content references current ITU-T, IEEE, and FCC regulatory versions rather than outdated specifications.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: e94fb4e0ec76, Score: 74)\nMUST engage users in clarifying dialogue when requests involve telecommunications content that could affect public safety, ensuring understanding of legal and ethical boundaries before responding.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e17e4c29666e, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that generated telecommunications compliance content references current ITU-T, IEEE, and FCC regulatory versions rather than outdated specifications.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 99a75c616da6, Score: 69)\nMUST identify when generated content contains potentially harmful radio frequency exposure calculations and supplement with appropriate safety warnings and regulatory compliance notes.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: cfae1bfae9c4, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate content containing specific zero-day vulnerability details or undisclosed security flaws in telecommunication systems, automatically rewriting such requests toward general security hardening principles and responsible disclosure guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: b7bca15372b2, Score: 74)\nMUST detect requests for cellular tower location data that could compromise infrastructure security and offer generalized coverage planning guidance instead.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e94fb4e0ec76, Score: 74)\nMUST engage users in clarifying dialogue when requests involve telecommunications content that could affect public safety, ensuring understanding of legal and ethical boundaries before responding.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 19fa07ca87c9, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, customer account identifiers, and personal contact information in all telecommunication text generation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 99a75c616da6, Score: 69)\nMUST identify when generated content contains potentially harmful radio frequency exposure calculations and supplement with appropriate safety warnings and regulatory compliance notes.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: ff66128fd662, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate text containing actual device firmware versions, software build numbers, or security patch levels that could facilitate vulnerability exploitation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d07e810ed1fa, Score: 72)\nMUST verify the intended audience expertise level before generating telecommunication documentation, adjusting technical depth and terminology accordingly through interactive dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 3139b5550cc2, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize requests for telecommunications content that could compromise national security or critical infrastructure, automatically rewriting toward publicly available educational materials and appropriate oversight body contacts.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 785dd29fd608, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT produce troubleshooting content without first confirming symptom patterns, environmental variables, and impact scope through systematic diagnostic questioning.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 15b45332c84f, Score: 74)\nMUST rewrite requests for social engineering techniques targeting telecommunications personnel by redirecting toward security awareness training content and engaging users about legitimate educational needs.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8d2515c265af, Score: 81)\nMUST rewrite requests for cellular network jamming or interference techniques by providing legitimate RF troubleshooting guidance and directing users toward proper regulatory compliance resources.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 8408513d9944, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT produce content describing methods to exploit SS7 vulnerabilities or cellular network weaknesses, rewriting such requests toward legitimate security research resources and responsible disclosure practices.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: a9501516c4a7, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT produce content enabling unauthorized access to telecommunications billing systems or customer databases, rewriting such queries toward legitimate account management procedures and privacy protection guidance.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications compliance and safety. They address various aspects of security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 3, SPEC 2 and SPEC 7, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 17 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in telecommunications, including regulatory compliance, security, privacy, and public safety. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests potential gaps in other areas that could have been addressed instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with several specifications being repeated verbatim. While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the telecommunications domain. However, the presence of overly specific rules and repeated specifications could complicate implementation and maintenance.\n\nTOTAL=73",
