    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical and safe classification practices. They address various aspects of privacy, discrimination, and professional boundaries, creating logical connections between different requirements. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, discrimination, and professional ethics. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are some gaps in addressing broader foundational rules that could enhance the overall framework.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated or overlapping, such as those addressing minors and harmful stereotypes. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, though some rules are overly specific, which could limit flexibility. The set is adaptable but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules."
