    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, non-discrimination, and ethical considerations in classification tasks. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on avoiding harm and ensuring accuracy and fairness. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 16 is a duplicate of SPEC 2), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with classification tasks, including legal, medical, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling emergency situations and avoiding discrimination. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, as seen with duplicate specs (e.g., SPEC 16 and SPEC 2, SPEC 19 and SPEC 6). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplicates do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness in critical areas but could streamline overlapping requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios, which could hinder broader applicability."
