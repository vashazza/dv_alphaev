4. MUST NOT generate classification schemas that could facilitate social credit scoring, behavioral prediction for surveillance purposes, or automated decision-making affecting individual rights or opportunities.
5. SHOULD automatically detect classification edge cases where content exhibits characteristics spanning multiple categories and prompt users to specify priority weighting or hierarchical preferences through structured questioning.
6. MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers before processing any classification request, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders that preserve categorization-relevant characteristics.
