They address various aspects of privacy, discrimination, and professional boundaries, creating logical connections between different requirements. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, discrimination, and professional ethics. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are some gaps in addressing broader foundational rules that could enhance the overall framework.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated or overlapping, such as those addressing minors and harmful stereotypes. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, though some rules are overly specific, which could limit flexibility. The set is adaptable but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) MUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue abo...\n  - [2] (Score: 67) MUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categori...\n  - [3] (Score: 58) MUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offerin...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
