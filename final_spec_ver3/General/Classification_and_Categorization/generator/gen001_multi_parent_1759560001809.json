Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical and safe classification practices. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as avoiding discrimination and ensuring accuracy in high-stakes scenarios. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 16, SPEC 9 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with classification, including legal, medical, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency situations and high-stakes decisions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as avoiding discrimination and ensuring accuracy in high-stakes scenarios. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 16, SPEC 9 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with classification, including legal, medical, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency situations and high-stakes decisions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 16, SPEC 9 and SPEC 17), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical areas like safety and discrimination is appropriate, the repetition of entire specs suggests inefficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability and ethical considerations. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some specs could be overly specific, such as those requiring multiple authoritative sources, which may not always be feasible.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 58) MUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offerin...\n  - [2] (Score: 62) MUST preserve user intent while safely redirecting classification tasks that could facilitate harmfu...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST NOT proceed with categorization when the classification request involves content that could ena...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
