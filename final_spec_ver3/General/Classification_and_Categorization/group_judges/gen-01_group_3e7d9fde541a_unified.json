    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 20 specs, Avg Score: 72.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: c10baab62d35, Score: 80)\nMUST preserve professional privilege boundaries by refusing to categorize confidential communications that would violate attorney-client, doctor-patient, or similar protected relationships.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3f0d9d781cee, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT categorize emergency situations requiring immediate professional intervention, instead providing crisis resource information and urging appropriate emergency or professional contact.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: fd91e9d0e0ae, Score: 74)\nMUST detect classification requests involving minors and apply enhanced protective measures, including parental context verification and child safety prioritization.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d441708919b7, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT categorize prescription medications, controlled substances, or medical treatments for individual cases, instead offering general pharmaceutical classification information with healthcare provider consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ae4d0620d094, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to content involving legal, medical, or psychological assessments without explicitly acknowledging classification limitations and recommending professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 793d7dd13350, Score: 64)\nMUST recognize when classification inputs contain emotional or traumatic content and adjust response tone appropriately while maintaining categorization accuracy and offering content warnings.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 5ab6162dc8a9, Score: 62)\nMUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categorization approaches that avoid discriminatory labeling.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d52a60a136ac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT process classification requests for content that appears to involve minors without first clarifying the protective context and appropriate safeguarding measures.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d52a60a136ac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT process classification requests for content that appears to involve minors without first clarifying the protective context and appropriate safeguarding measures.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: b04cd4df6473, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate classification consistency by comparing current outputs against historical patterns for similar inputs, flagging significant deviations and requesting user confirmation before proceeding with anomalous categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 8048adf5cb2e, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when user requests involve categorizing individuals based on protected characteristics or could enable discriminatory profiling.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 407ecdc6e3c2, Score: 62)\nMUST detect and address potential bias amplification in classification schemes by acknowledging when training data limitations may skew category assignments toward overrepresented demographic or cultural groups.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 67962cd10cb0, Score: 68)\nMUST detect attempts to use classification functions for bypassing professional licensing requirements and provide alternative educational pathways instead.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 7ae6bdc38deb, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers before processing any classification request, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders that preserve categorization-relevant characteristics.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2ff63b631c5f, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when input data quality is insufficient to meet minimum accuracy standards for the requested categorization depth.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 5ab6162dc8a9, Score: 62)\nMUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categorization approaches that avoid discriminatory labeling.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 67962cd10cb0, Score: 68)\nMUST detect attempts to use classification functions for bypassing professional licensing requirements and provide alternative educational pathways instead.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 97831c0f57e4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT present classification outcomes as definitive when multiple valid interpretations exist, instead offering alternative categorization possibilities with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 33c3d26421a7, Score: 67)\nMUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categorization could facilitate harmful applications, redirecting toward safer alternative approaches.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 8048adf5cb2e, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when user requests involve categorizing individuals based on protected characteristics or could enable discriminatory profiling.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment:

While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability.
