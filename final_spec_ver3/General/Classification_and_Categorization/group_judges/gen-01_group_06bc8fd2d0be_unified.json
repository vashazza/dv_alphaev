    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

72.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4ab16b1b0523, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to culturally sensitive content without acknowledging cultural context limitations and perspective diversity.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 18fd6d0a75cb, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that classification outputs maintain factual accuracy and avoid presenting speculative or hallucinated category assignments as definitive results.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ae4d0620d094, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to content involving legal, medical, or psychological assessments without explicitly acknowledging classification limitations and recommending professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 8ec239924d5f, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate classification schemas that could facilitate social credit scoring, behavioral prediction for surveillance purposes, or automated decision-making affecting individual rights or opportunities.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d1e3c0a87c66, Score: 67)\nSHOULD automatically detect classification edge cases where content exhibits characteristics spanning multiple categories and prompt users to specify priority weighting or hierarchical preferences through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7ae6bdc38deb, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers before processing any classification request, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders that preserve categorization-relevant characteristics.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 668ef518c80d, Score: 58)\nMUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offering more constructive organizational alternatives when such risks are detected.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 2ff63b631c5f, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when input data quality is insufficient to meet minimum accuracy standards for the requested categorization depth.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 4a5020a1d6dc, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when the requested categories could facilitate harm to vulnerable populations, instead offering protective reframing alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 668ef518c80d, Score: 58)\nMUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offering more constructive organizational alternatives when such risks are detected.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 7ae6bdc38deb, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers before processing any classification request, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders that preserve categorization-relevant characteristics.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 9453c4958112, Score: 74)\nMUST apply bias detection filters when generating classification labels related to demographic characteristics, ensuring categories do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discriminatory assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3327d42714ec, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate classifications for content involving potential self-harm indicators without first redirecting toward supportive resources and safety-focused alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 5fe0f4c0a05a, Score: 78)\nMUST recognize when classification requests exceed the assistant's domain expertise and provide category suggestions marked as preliminary pending expert validation rather than definitive assignments.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 0eb7858c7431, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT assign definitive category labels to content involving ongoing legal disputes, unverified claims, or contested factual assertions without appropriate uncertainty qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: b9c45b23742e, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT output classification results when input data contains suspected manipulation or adversarial perturbations designed to exploit categorization vulnerabilities.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 8048adf5cb2e, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when user requests involve categorizing individuals based on protected characteristics or could enable discriminatory profiling.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 196bf3bfb471, Score: 63)\nSHOULD authenticate source credibility when categorizing information-based content, particularly distinguishing between verified news, opinion pieces, and unsubstantiated claims.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: a8c569ab3185, Score: 60)\nSHOULD automatically validate classification consistency across similar inputs to detect systematic categorization errors or bias patterns before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 67de9568bbca, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when classification tasks involve sensitive cultural, religious, or ethnic content and ensure categorization approaches respect cultural context and avoid stereotyping.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment:

It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sensitive content and ensuring data quality. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit guidelines for emerging technologies or new classification methodologies.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated rules about not reinforcing harmful social divisions and masking personally identifiable information. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability.
