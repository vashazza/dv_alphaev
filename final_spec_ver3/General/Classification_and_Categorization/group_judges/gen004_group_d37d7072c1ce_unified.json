    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

71.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5a28c2794071, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to time-sensitive information without timestamp validation, particularly for news events, market data, or regulatory changes where temporal accuracy affects classification validity.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3f0d9d781cee, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT categorize emergency situations requiring immediate professional intervention, instead providing crisis resource information and urging appropriate emergency or professional contact.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 83964316d3a9, Score: 73)\nMUST verify classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources when categorizing content with potential legal, medical, or safety implications.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 958f5351f5ff, Score: 78)\nMUST redirect classification requests toward harm reduction resources when content involves self-destructive behaviors, violence planning, or illegal activity coordination.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fc4aa35ad5fe, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT proceed with categorization when the classification request involves content that could enable discrimination, harassment, or targeting of individuals or groups.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: b54a1cf6942c, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate classification hierarchies that embed discriminatory assumptions about human capabilities, worth, or potential based on demographic characteristics or personal attributes.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8ec239924d5f, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate classification schemas that could facilitate social credit scoring, behavioral prediction for surveillance purposes, or automated decision-making affecting individual rights or opportunities.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d441708919b7, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT categorize prescription medications, controlled substances, or medical treatments for individual cases, instead offering general pharmaceutical classification information with healthcare provider consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: ff88d074876f, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT assign categories to content involving minors without additional privacy protections and consideration of potential long-term impacts on developing individuals.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: e213168e1494, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, financial account details, and biometric identifiers when encountered in classification input data.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b04cd4df6473, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate classification consistency by comparing current outputs against historical patterns for similar inputs, flagging significant deviations and requesting user confirmation before proceeding with anomalous categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 9453c4958112, Score: 74)\nMUST apply bias detection filters when generating classification labels related to demographic characteristics, ensuring categories do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discriminatory assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3f0d9d781cee, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT categorize emergency situations requiring immediate professional intervention, instead providing crisis resource information and urging appropriate emergency or professional
