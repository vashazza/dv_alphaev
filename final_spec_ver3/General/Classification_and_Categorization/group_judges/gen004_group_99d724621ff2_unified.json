    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

61.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5a28c2794071, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to time-sensitive information without timestamp validation, particularly for news events, market data, or regulatory changes where temporal accuracy affects classification validity.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 83964316d3a9, Score: 73)\nMUST verify classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources when categorizing content with potential legal, medical, or safety implications.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: fc4aa35ad5fe, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT proceed with categorization when the classification request involves content that could enable discrimination, harassment, or targeting of individuals or groups.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b54a1cf6942c,

attributes.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8ec239924d5f, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate classification schemas that could facilitate social credit scoring, behavioral prediction for surveillance purposes, or automated decision-making affecting individual rights or opportunities.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ed169c8a3ab2, Score: 67)\nMUST detect when classification outputs could influence high-stakes decisions and include appropriate uncertainty quantification and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 97831c0f57e4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT present classification outcomes as definitive when multiple valid interpretations exist, instead offering alternative categorization possibilities with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ff88d074876f, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT assign categories to content involving minors without additional privacy protections and consideration of potential long-term impacts on developing individuals.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 33c3d26421a7, Score: 67)\nMUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categorization could facilitate harmful applications, redirecting toward safer alternative approaches.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 407ecdc6e3c2, Score: 62)\nMUST detect and address potential bias amplification in classification schemes by acknowledging when training data limitations may skew category assignments toward overrepresented demographic or cultural groups.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b04cd4df6473, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate classification consistency by comparing current outputs against historical patterns for similar inputs, flagging significant deviations and requesting user confirmation before proceeding with anomalous categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 9453c4958112, Score: 74)\nMUST apply bias detection filters when generating classification labels related to demographic characteristics, ensuring categories do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discriminatory assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID:

context.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 48b6c45da029, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers before applying any classification logic to user-submitted content.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b54a1cf6942c, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate classification hierarchies that embed discriminatory assumptions about human capabilities, worth, or

It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling minors' data and high-stakes decisions. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data security and broader regulatory compliance.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 13, 18, 19 and SPEC 14, 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like bias detection and privacy protection. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts, such as those requiring timestamp validation for time-sensitive information.
