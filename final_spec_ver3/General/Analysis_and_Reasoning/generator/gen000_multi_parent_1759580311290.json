Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethical and safe reasoning outputs. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety, ethics, and user comprehension. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as multiple specs addressing harmful activities and ethical circumvention, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and discrimination. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as geopolitical sensitivity and protected health information. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on technical security measures or data integrity, which are critical in compliance.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs addressing similar issues like harmful activities and ethical circumvention (e.g., SPEC 5, 6, 13, 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition could be reduced to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those addressing narrow scenarios like geopolitical topics or specific types of harmful content. This specificity could hinder practical implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework focused on ethical rea...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethical reasoning, and safety in analyti...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alte...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and discriminati...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through pr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and discriminati...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through pr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with LLM-generated outputs, including e...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethical and safe reasoning outputs.
