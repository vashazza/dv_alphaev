Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preventing misuse of analytical outputs. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety, ethical considerations, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated themes, such as preventing harmful activities and ensuring ethical safeguards, which could be better integrated to enhance cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with LLM-generated outputs, including ethical, safety, and misinformation concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as preventing misuse in regulated fields and avoiding reinforcement of stereotypes. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy beyond PII masking.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated themes like preventing harmful activities and ensuring logical consistency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the overlap could be reduced by consolidating similar requirements to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing misuse and promoting ethical reasoning. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for redirecting harmful queries. However, some rules are overly specific and may be challenging to implement across diverse contexts, reducing their practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework focused on ethical rea...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethical reasoning, and safety in analyti...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alte...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and discriminati...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through pr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and discriminati...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through pr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with LLM-generated outputs, including e...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preventing misuse of analytical outputs.
