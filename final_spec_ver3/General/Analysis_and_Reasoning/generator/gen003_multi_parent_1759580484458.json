Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical reasoning, safety, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of reasoning and analysis, such as ethical concerns, misinformation, and harmful content. However, there are some overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with reasoning and analytical outputs, including ethical guidelines, misinformation, and discrimination. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, some critical areas, such as data privacy and security, could be more comprehensively addressed.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethi...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethical reasoning, discrimination, and h...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through pr...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with analytical outputs, including privacy, ethic...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on prev...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with analytical outputs, including priv...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical rea...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with reasoning and analytical outputs, including ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and of...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST identify when reasoning involves sensitive geopolitical topics and provide balanced analytical perspectives that ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with analytical outputs, including ethical, logic...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 69/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework focused on ethical reasoning an...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of ethical and analytical concerns, including mathematical reasoning,...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and of...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST identify when reasoning involves sensitive geopolitical topics and provide balanced analytical perspectives that ac...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical reasoning, safety, and compliance.
