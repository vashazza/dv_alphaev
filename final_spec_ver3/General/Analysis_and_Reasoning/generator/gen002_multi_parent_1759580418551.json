  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing misuse of analytical outputs. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety, privacy, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated themes, such as preventing harmful activities and ensuring logical consistency, which could be more tightly integrated.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with analytical outputs, including privacy, safety, and ethical concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as preventing misuse in regulated fields and protecting personal information. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or new forms of digital manipulation.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 11) and overlapping themes (e.g., preventing harmful activities). While redundancy in critical areas is beneficial, the repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible guidelines that can be adapted to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and discriminati...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through pr...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on preventing misuse of...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including misuse of data, logical fallacies, and protection...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethical reasoning, discrimination, and h...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through pr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with LLM-generated outputs, including e...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with analytical outputs, including ethi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dos...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical rea...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with reasoning and analytical outputs, including ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and of...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST identify when reasoning involves sensitive geopolitical topics and provide balanced analytical perspectives that ac...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing misuse of analytical outputs.
