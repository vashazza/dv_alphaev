    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical reasoning, safety, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of reasoning and analysis, such as ethical concerns, misinformation, and harmful content. However, there are some overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with reasoning and analytical outputs, including ethical guidelines, misinformation, and discrimination. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, some critical areas, such as data privacy and security, could be more comprehensively addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
