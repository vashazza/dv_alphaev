    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing misuse of analytical outputs. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety, privacy, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated themes, such as preventing harmful activities and ensuring logical consistency, which could be more tightly integrated.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with analytical outputs, including privacy, safety, and ethical concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as preventing misuse in regulated fields and protecting personal information. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or new forms of digital manipulation.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 11) and overlapping themes (e.g., preventing harmful activities). While redundancy in critical areas is beneficial, the repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible guidelines that can be adapted to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios."
