    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preventing misuse of analytical outputs. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety, ethical considerations, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated themes, such as preventing harmful activities and ensuring ethical safeguards, which could be better integrated to enhance cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with LLM-generated outputs, including ethical, safety, and misinformation concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as preventing misuse in regulated fields and avoiding reinforcement of stereotypes. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated themes like preventing harmful activities and ensuring logical consistency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the overlap could be reduced by consolidating similar requirements to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing misuse and promoting ethical reasoning. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for redirecting harmful queries. However, some rules are overly specific and may be challenging to implement across diverse contexts, reducing their practicality."
