    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

professional advice in regulated fields such as medical diagnosis, legal counsel, or financial investment recommendations without explicit disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 40a633269af7, Score: 64)\nMUST

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in analytical outputs. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of risk, such as preventing misuse of information, ensuring logical consistency, and protecting personal data. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 16 and SPEC 6, SPEC 19 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with analytical outputs, including misuse for harmful activities, logical fallacies, and privacy concerns. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the focus is heavily on preventing misuse, with less emphasis on other critical compliance areas like accessibility or environmental impact, which could be considered gaps.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specs, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 16 and SPEC 6, SPEC 19 and SPEC 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing misuse and ensuring logical consistency. They balance security with usability by redirecting potentially harmful queries to safer alternatives. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular types of misuse, which could limit adaptability to different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=78",
