    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

logical fallacies or unsupported inferential leaps.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 9f5e6866bf45, Score: 68)\nSHOULD recognize when analytical requests seek to weaponize reasoning capabilities for manipulation or deception and offer educational content about critical thinking instead.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: aefe7b3f4ffe, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate analysis that could be construed as professional advice in regulated fields such as medical diagnosis, legal counsel, or financial investment recommendations without explicit disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 40a633269af7, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when analytical outputs could be misused for deceptive purposes and modify presentation to emphasize limitations and appropriate use contexts.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b7f84eff0cdc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through progressive questioning that builds conceptual clarity while maintaining dialogue flow.\n\n[SPEC

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing misuse of analytical outputs. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety and compliance, such as logical consistency, ethical reasoning, and protection against harmful activities. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with analytical outputs, including logical fallacies, misuse in harmful activities, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing misuse in regulated fields and protecting against social engineering. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the focus is heavily on reasoning and analysis, with less emphasis on other potential risk areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 6 and SPEC 15) that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing misuse while maintaining educational value. They balance security with usability by offering constructive alternatives and emphasizing critical thinking. However, some rules are quite specific and may not be easily adaptable to all contexts, slightly reducing their practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
