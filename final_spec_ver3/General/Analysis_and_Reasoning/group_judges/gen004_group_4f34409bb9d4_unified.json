    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

fallacies or unsupported inferential leaps.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 35c33eb49aec, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning chains that could enable circumvention of safety systems, content policies, or access

critical thinking instead.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: aefe7b3f4ffe, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate analysis that could be construed as professional advice in regulated fields such as medical diagnosis, legal counsel, or financial investment recommendations without explicit disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 40a633269af7, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when analytical outputs could be misused for deceptive purposes and modify presentation to emphasize limitations and appropriate use contexts.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f46309362f3f, Score: 61)\nSHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement responses with counter-perspectives and bias awareness information.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f46309362f3f, Score: 61)\nSHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement responses with counter-perspectives and bias awareness information.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f46309362f3f, Score: 61)\nSHOULD detect

It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps in addressing emerging threats or novel misuse scenarios that could be included for more comprehensive coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 13). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar rules without significant differentiation suggests inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating overlapping specs.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing misuse while maintaining educational value. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to all contexts, which could hinder practical implementation.
