Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They focus on verifying user intent, maintaining security, and ensuring compliance, which are logically connected. However, there is some repetition (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 11 are identical), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security boundaries, and compliance with professional and data protection standards. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, though some areas could be more explicitly addressed, such as broader foundational rules.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with identical specs (SPEC 1 and SPEC 11), and overlapping themes (e.g., user intent verification appears in multiple specs). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit flexibility in certain scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety concerns, from data protection to user autho...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST transform requests for bypassing professional oversight into discussions of proper channels, qualification requirem...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide detailed procedural guidance for complex technical operations without first confirming user expertise l...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
