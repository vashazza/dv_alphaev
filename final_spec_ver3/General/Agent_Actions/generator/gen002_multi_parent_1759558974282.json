Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, compliance, and responsible use of AI. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety, such as data protection, professional oversight, and unauthorized access. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 14), which slightly disrupt the cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety issues, including data protection, unauthorized access, and professional oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as chaining requests and tool usage. However, there are some gaps in addressing broader foundational rules, and the focus is heavily on security without much emphasis on other compliance areas.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 14, SPEC 5 and SPEC 7), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like data protection and unauthorized access. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability in diverse situations..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
