Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy. They cover various aspects of security, authorization, and data protection, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical compliance areas such as unauthorized access, data protection, and procedural oversight. However, there could be more emphasis on general principles to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs 2 and 6, and specs 4 and 12, which are identical. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety concerns, from data protection to user autho...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST transform requests for bypassing professional oversight into discussions of proper channels, qualification requirem...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide detailed procedural guidance for complex technical operations without first confirming user expertise l...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
