    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They focus on verifying user intent, maintaining security, and ensuring compliance, which are logically connected. However, there is some repetition (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 11 are identical), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security boundaries, and compliance with professional and data protection standards. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, though some areas could be more explicitly addressed, such as broader foundational rules.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with identical specs (SPEC 1 and SPEC 11), and overlapping themes (e.g., user intent verification appears in multiple specs). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit flexibility in certain scenarios."
