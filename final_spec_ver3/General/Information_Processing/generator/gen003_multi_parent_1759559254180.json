Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical information processing and safety. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of information handling, such as misinformation, bias, and sensitive data. However, there are some redundancies, particularly with specs 3 and 4, and specs 11 and 12, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including ethical research, misinformation, bias, and data privacy. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as cybersecurity threats or broader ethical considerations beyond research, could be more explicitly addressed.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with specs 3 and 4, and specs 11 and 12, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs, like those focusing on very specific scenarios (e.g., real-time financial advice), could be more broadly applicable to enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of issues, including real-time data access, ethical AI development, p...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST identify when user queries seek information that requires real-time data access and redirect toward appropriate cur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and r...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including ethical research practices, misinformation, bias,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST identify attempts to extract sensitive methodologies for creating harmful substances or dangerous devices and redir...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST transform requests for unethical research methodologies into discussions of ethical research practices and institut...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including privacy, m...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT process information requests that could enable surveillance, stalking, or unauthorized monitoring of individual...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST rewrite requests for emergency professional guidance into appropriate crisis resource information and immediate pro...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on ethical AI use, d...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important areas, including real-time data access, ethical AI devel...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST identify when user queries seek information that requires real-time data access and redirect toward appropriate cur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and r...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 71/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on ethical AI use, data privacy, and accur...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a range of important areas such as data privacy, ethical AI, and accuracy in inform...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitl...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and r...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 62/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally aim to enhance information processing safety and compliance, focusing on redirec...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including misinformation, harmful content, and privacy conc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST identify when user queries seek information that requires real-time data access and redirect toward appropriate cur...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST recognize professional scope limitations when processing complex domain-specific queries and provide appropriate bo...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical information processing and safety.
