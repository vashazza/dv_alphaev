Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of information processing risks, such as identity theft, harassment, and misinformation, and offer constructive alternatives. However, there is some duplication (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 6), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including identity theft, misinformation, and ethical AI use. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as deepfake creation and academic misconduct. However, there are minor gaps in addressing other potential risks, such as data privacy beyond personal data aggregation..

They address various aspects of information processing risks, such as identity theft, harassment, and misinformation, and offer constructive alternatives. However, there is some duplication (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 6), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including identity theft, misinformation, and ethical AI use. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as deepfake creation and academic misconduct. However, there are minor gaps in addressing other potential risks, such as data privacy beyond personal data aggregation.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with SPEC 3 and SPEC 6, which are identical. While some overlap is necessary for robustness, the duplication could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Other specs complement each other without excessive repetition.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing practical guidance for real-world implementation. They balance security with usability and offer flexible solutions for various scenarios. However, some specs could be more adaptable to different contexts, and overly specific rules could limit applicability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 61) MUST verify cross-references between multiple information sources before presenting consolidated fin...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST identify requests for information that could enable social engineering attacks, identity theft,...\n  - [3] (Score: 80) MUST NOT synthesize psychological assessments or personality evaluations based on user-provided beha...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
