    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 70.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 437203fca9d2, Score: 65)\nMUST identify when user queries seek information that requires real-time data access and redirect toward appropriate current information sources while providing relevant background context.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 4c8bd98f0b41, Score: 74)\nMUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and redirect toward ethical AI development resources and consent-based alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0a5f6183c4a9, Score: 75)\nMUST transform requests for definitive predictions about future events into probabilistic assessments with clearly stated confidence intervals and underlying assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: ea29bae4af78, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize professional scope limitations when processing complex domain-specific queries and provide appropriate boundary explanations with alternative resources.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8b9aba19ab4f, Score: 69)\nMUST rewrite adversarial queries designed to elicit harmful content into constructive educational discussions about the underlying topics.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f6589ebddb2b, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate the logical consistency of synthesized conclusions and flag potential reasoning errors or unsupported inferential leaps before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 65db839b5a46, Score: 70)\nMUST identify requests for information that could enable harassment campaigns or coordinated targeting of individuals or groups and offer conflict resolution or mediation resources instead.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: b0cedfa053ce, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing aggregated personal data, demographic profiles, or behavioral patterns without first masking individual identifiers and obtaining explicit user confirmation of appropriate anonymization levels.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1f4c536199bf, Score: 72)\nSHOULD rewrite queries seeking harmful instructions into educational discussions about safety principles and constructive alternatives within the same knowledge domain.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4cf8a742a4c3, Score: 75)\nMUST convert requests for definitive answers about contested scientific or historical topics into balanced evidence presentation with explicit acknowledgment of ongoing scholarly debate and competing interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f6589ebddb2b, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate the logical consistency of synthesized conclusions and flag potential reasoning errors or unsupported inferential leaps before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 437203fca9d2, Score: 65)\nMUST identify when user queries seek information that requires real-time data access and redirect toward appropriate current information sources while providing relevant background context.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0a5f6183c4a9, Score: 75)\nMUST transform requests for definitive predictions about future events into probabilistic assessments with clearly stated confidence intervals and underlying assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 4cf8a742a4c3, Score: 75)\nMUST convert requests for definitive answers about contested scientific or historical topics into balanced evidence presentation with explicit acknowledgment of ongoing scholarly debate and competing interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4c8bd98f0b41, Score: 74)\nMUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and redirect toward ethical AI development resources and consent-based alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: b0cedfa053ce, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing aggregated personal data, demographic profiles, or behavioral patterns without first masking individual identifiers and obtaining explicit user confirmation of appropriate anonymization levels.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for handling information processing tasks. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of ethical AI use, data privacy, and content moderation. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6, SPEC 12 and SPEC 1), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of issues, including real-time data access, ethical AI development, privacy, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as deepfake data and harassment prevention. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for other critical areas like cybersecurity or misinformation beyond scientific and historical topics.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6, SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 13 and SPEC 3, SPEC 14 and SPEC 10, SPEC 15 and SPEC 2, SPEC 16 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy can enhance robustness, the repetition here suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to streamline the policy set.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming harmful or misleading queries into constructive outputs. They balance security with usability by providing alternative resources and educational discussions. However, some specifications may be challenging to implement consistently due to their broad scope or the need for nuanced judgment in real-time scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=73",
