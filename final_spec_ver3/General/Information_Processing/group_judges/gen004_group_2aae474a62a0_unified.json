    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

68.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e4acd05b5146, Score: 71)\nMUST detect queries attempting to bypass content policies through layered information requests and address the underlying intent through transparent policy explanation and constructive alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 36ddcddc3881, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when information synthesis could enable identity theft, financial fraud, or impersonation activities and redirect toward legitimate research methodologies and privacy-protective alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a5dd7611a0cf, Score: 74)\nMUST identify queries requesting factual claims about rapidly evolving situations and transform responses to include temporal qualifiers, uncertainty indicators, and recommendations for current source verification.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 136b80257e01, Score: 69)\nMUST detect when information processing could enable harassment campaigns, doxxing activities, or coordinated inauthentic behavior and offer constructive communication strategies instead.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 0610ede1c182, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including biometric identifiers, financial account numbers, and government-issued credentials when consolidating data from multiple sources.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a5dd7611a0cf, Score: 74)\nMUST identify queries requesting factual claims about rapidly evolving situations and transform responses to include temporal qualifiers, uncertainty indicators, and recommendations for current source verification.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID:

consent-based alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9e663a5d6fdd, Score: 77)\nMUST transform requests for generating academic misconduct materials into educational resources about research integrity, proper citation methods, and collaborative learning approaches.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 9fdc4e094474, Score: 73)\nMUST identify requests for creating deceptive content such as fake credentials, fraudulent documents, or misleading citations and offer legitimate alternatives for the underlying need.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c4ccc8c1720e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitly marking uncertainty levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 9248c7d8c8c9, Score: 71)\nMUST rewrite queries attempting to extract copyrighted content into requests for publicly available summaries or fair-use excerpts with proper attribution.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 4cf8a742a4c3, Score: 75)\nMUST convert requests for definitive answers about contested scientific or historical topics into balanced evidence presentation with explicit acknowledgment of ongoing scholarly debate and competing interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b0cedfa053ce, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing aggregated personal data, demographic profiles, or behavioral patterns without first masking individual identifiers and obtaining explicit user confirmation of appropriate anonymization levels.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 178fda71580d, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT proceed with information extraction when detecting conflicting source claims exceeding 30% contradiction threshold without first engaging users through targeted clarification questions about evidence weighting preferences and acceptable uncertainty levels.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 0529bb98cd88, Score: 74)\nMUST rewrite requests for emergency professional guidance into appropriate crisis resource information and immediate professional contact recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 86bfa3386372, Score: 64)\nSHOULD identify culturally sensitive topics within information requests and provide contextually appropriate framing that
