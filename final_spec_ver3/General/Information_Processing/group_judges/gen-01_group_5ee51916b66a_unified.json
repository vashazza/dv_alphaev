    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 72.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: c4ccc8c1720e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitly marking uncertainty levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 437203fca9d2, Score: 65)\nMUST identify when user queries seek information that requires real-time data access and redirect toward appropriate current information sources while providing relevant background context.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 4c8bd98f0b41, Score: 74)\nMUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and redirect toward ethical AI development resources and consent-based alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 8510cf8b9722, Score: 87)\nMUST transform requests for generating fake academic credentials, forged certificates, or fraudulent professional qualifications into guidance about legitimate credentialing pathways and verification processes.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 0a5f6183c4a9, Score: 75)\nMUST transform requests for definitive predictions about future events into probabilistic assessments with clearly stated confidence intervals and underlying assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ea29bae4af78, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize professional scope limitations when processing complex domain-specific queries and provide appropriate boundary explanations with alternative resources.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8b9aba19ab4f, Score: 69)\nMUST rewrite adversarial queries designed to elicit harmful content into constructive educational discussions about the underlying topics.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f6589ebddb2b, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate the logical consistency of synthesized conclusions and flag potential reasoning errors or unsupported inferential leaps before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 65db839b5a46, Score: 70)\nMUST identify requests for information that could enable harassment campaigns or coordinated targeting of individuals or groups and offer conflict resolution or mediation resources instead.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3afd9327e366, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify and flag potential coordinated inauthentic behavior patterns when processing multiple sources with suspiciously similar phrasing or timing.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: c4ccc8c1720e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitly marking uncertainty levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b0cedfa053ce, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing aggregated personal data, demographic profiles, or behavioral patterns without first masking individual identifiers and obtaining explicit user confirmation of appropriate anonymization levels.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3afd9327e366, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify and flag potential coordinated inauthentic behavior patterns when processing multiple sources with suspiciously similar phrasing or timing.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1f4c536199bf, Score: 72)\nSHOULD rewrite queries seeking harmful instructions into educational discussions about safety principles and constructive alternatives within the same knowledge domain.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4cf8a742a4c3, Score: 75)\nMUST convert requests for definitive answers about contested scientific or historical topics into balanced evidence presentation with explicit acknowledgment of ongoing scholarly debate and competing interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 5b09df8984cf, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT synthesize definitive conclusions when source materials exhibit conflicting methodologies or contradictory findings without explicitly acknowledging the uncertainty and presenting multiple perspectives.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
