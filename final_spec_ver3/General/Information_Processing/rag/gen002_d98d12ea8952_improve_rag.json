    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, accuracy, and ethical considerations. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-referencing information and protecting personal data. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including privacy, misinformation, and ethical use of data. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing surveillance and social engineering attacks. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging risks, such as AI-generated misinformation or deepfake content, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications (SPEC 5, 10, and 13), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The rules are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, and the repetition of certain rules may complicate implementation and maintenance."
