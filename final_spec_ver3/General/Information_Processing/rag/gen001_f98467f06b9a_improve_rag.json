    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, accuracy, and ethical considerations. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing data and protecting personal information. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including privacy, misinformation, and ethical use of data. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling copyrighted content and preventing social engineering attacks. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging risks or technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that address similar issues, such as Specs 14 and 15, which are identical. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be overly specific, which might limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
