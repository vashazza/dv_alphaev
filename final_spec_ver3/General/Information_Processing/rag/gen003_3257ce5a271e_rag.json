    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical information processing and safety. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of information handling, such as misinformation, bias, and sensitive data. However, there are some redundancies, particularly with specs 3 and 4, and specs 11 and 12, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including ethical research, misinformation, bias, and data privacy. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as cybersecurity threats or broader ethical considerations beyond research, could be more explicitly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with specs 3 and 4, and specs 11 and 12, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs, like those focusing on very specific scenarios (e.g., real-time financial advice), could be more broadly applicable to enhance practicality."
