    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring communication safety and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of communication, such as privacy, accuracy, and professional boundaries. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the areas of privacy and information verification, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including deception, privacy, cultural competency, and crisis management. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling personally identifiable information and crisis situations. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies and platforms.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to privacy and information masking (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can enhance robustness, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas but could streamline certain aspects.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various communication scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts, slightly reducing practicality."
