    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for communication safety and compliance. They address various aspects of communication, such as privacy, bias, and deception, and there are logical connections between them. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of communication risks, including privacy, bias, deception, and temporal context. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, though some areas, like cultural sensitivity, could be expanded. Overall, the coverage is comprehensive but could benefit from more foundational rules.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., privacy violations and biased source material). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in broader scenarios."
