    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure the accuracy, privacy, and ethical boundaries of communication tasks. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on privacy (Specs 5, 6, 9, 18) and the need for professional consultation (Specs 2, 4, 16). However, some specs could be better integrated, such as those focusing on cultural competency (Spec 3) and temporal accuracy (Spec 13).",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, accuracy, professional boundaries, and crisis management. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as privacy violations and crisis detection. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital communication nuances, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in privacy-related specs (Specs 6, 9, 18), which could be consolidated for efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas like privacy, the repetition of similar requirements suggests potential for streamlining without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as professional consultation and crisis management. However, some specs are overly specific, like those requiring enhanced verification for current events (Spec 15), which could be more flexible to improve practicality."
