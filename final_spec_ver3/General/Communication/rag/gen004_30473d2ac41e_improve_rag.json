    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, focusing on safety, privacy, and accuracy in communication. There are logical connections between detecting manipulative queries, ensuring privacy, and maintaining factual consistency. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly disrupts cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including privacy, bias, and factual accuracy. It balances general principles with specific scenarios, such as handling vulnerable populations and copyrighted material. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies and platforms.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., prompt injection detection and liability-creating statements). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like privacy and bias. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring enhanced scrutiny for particular user groups, which may complicate implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would improve practicality."
