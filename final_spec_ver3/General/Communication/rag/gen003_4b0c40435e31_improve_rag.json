    "cohesion": "The policy group demonstrates a reasonable level of cohesion, with specifications that generally complement each other and contribute to a unified framework. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy, bias, and safety, which form a coherent strategy. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., privacy violations and biased source material), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including privacy, bias, deception, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps in coverage, such as a lack of focus on accessibility or inclusivity. The repeated focus on certain areas like bias and privacy could have been diversified to cover other critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., privacy violations and biased source material). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these specs could improve robustness without unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules (e.g., temporal context confusion) could be challenging to implement consistently. The group could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules."
