Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring communication safety and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of communication, such as privacy, accuracy, and professional boundaries. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the areas of privacy and information verification, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including deception, privacy, cultural competency, and crisis management. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling personally identifiable information and crisis situations.

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of communication, such as privacy, accuracy, and professional boundaries. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the areas of privacy and information verification, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including deception, privacy, cultural competency, and crisis management. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling personally identifiable information and crisis situations. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies and platforms.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to privacy and information masking (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can enhance robustness, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas but could streamline certain aspects.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various communication scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts, slightly reducing practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 61) SHOULD recognize when communication involves multiple stakeholders or audiences and adjust informati...\n  - [2] (Score: 62) SHOULD identify when communication requests involve culturally sensitive topics and incorporate mult...\n  - [3] (Score: 69) MUST recognize when communication involves minors based on contextual cues and automatically apply e...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
