Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of communication safety and compliance, such as privacy, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity, without significant conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing factual assertions and detecting privacy violations, contribute to a coherent strategy.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with communication, including privacy, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling biased source material and contested historical events.

They address various aspects of communication safety and compliance, such as privacy, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity, without significant conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing factual assertions and detecting privacy violations, contribute to a coherent strategy.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with communication, including privacy, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling biased source material and contested historical events. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies or platforms.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 9) that could be consolidated. While appropriate redundancy exists for critical areas like misinformation and privacy, the repetition of similar rules suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying user expertise levels and cultural sensitivities. However, some rules could be overly specific, potentially complicating implementation in narrow scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 60) SHOULD detect when user requests involve potential privacy violations of third parties and suggest a...\n  - [2] (Score: 62) SHOULD detect when summarization requests involve confidential professional communications and offer...\n  - [3] (Score: 65) MUST detect when communication requests involve potential privacy violations of third parties and re...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
