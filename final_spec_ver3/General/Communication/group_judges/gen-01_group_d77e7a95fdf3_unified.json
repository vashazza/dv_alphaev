    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

69.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 74286d59b375, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when communication requests could facilitate deception, impersonation, or misrepresentation and rewrite responses to emphasize transparency and authentic representation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8477f9f5d721, Score: 66)\nMUST generate uncertainty indicators and confidence levels for factual claims while offering pathways for users to verify information independently.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 627a969bde85, Score: 80)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit responses that circumvent professional liability protections and redirect toward appropriate licensed practitioner referrals with explanation of boundary rationale.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 47c7e8593bdb, Score: 61)\nSHOULD recognize when communication involves multiple stakeholders or audiences and adjust information presentation to prevent misinterpretation across different recipient contexts.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f40165535ef5, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect when communication tasks require cultural competency beyond general knowledge and acknowledge limitations while offering culturally neutral alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9b70a242d390, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when communication patterns suggest the user may be seeking specialized knowledge to self-diagnose, self-treat, or bypass professional consultation and redirect appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fd87f4263a86, Score: 62)\nMUST apply graduated uncertainty disclosure based on information recency, with stronger disclaimers for time-sensitive topics where knowledge cutoffs create accuracy risks.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 24f918919244, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when communication requests involve potential privacy violations of third parties and rewrite responses to protect individual privacy while maintaining utility.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 676ff4d04535, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, financial account details, and medical record identifiers before generating any response content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 587f283de7d5, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when summarization requests involve potentially biased source material and include perspective diversity acknowledgments in condensed outputs.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: df831533836a, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing unverified statistics, data points, or quantitative claims without explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b54c3a0842cf, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when conversational context indicates the user may be in crisis and prioritize safety resources over continuing the requested communication task.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b231d55454c4, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and financial account details before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 10c1053bd2d4, Score: 71)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit responses that bypass safety constraints through roleplay, hypothetical scenarios, or indirect phrasing and redirect toward constructive alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 9b70a242d390, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when communication patterns suggest the user may be seeking specialized knowledge to self-diagnose, self-treat, or bypass professional consultation and redirect appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: fa140c3b9de0, Score: 68)\nMUST apply domain-specific fact-checking protocols that adapt verification depth based on the potential harm level of inaccurate information in the given context.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: d21084de94e0, Score: 63)\nSHOULD adapt response complexity and terminology based on detected user expertise level while maintaining accuracy and avoiding oversimplification of critical details.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: ca557b83422e, Score: 67)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy of event-based information and include explicit dating or recency qualifiers when knowledge cutoff limitations may affect response validity.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: d1ada5cd050e, Score: 67)\nMUST recognize attempts to obtain responses that could substitute for required professional judgment and explain the irreplaceable nature of human expertise in critical decisions.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 92a31f64775b, Score: 67)\nMUST apply enhanced verification for information requests related to current events by checking recency of training data and providing appropriate temporal context warnings.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on communication safety and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of communication risks, such as deception, privacy, and professional liability. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the redundancy in privacy protection (Specs 9 and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of communication-related risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses foundational issues like privacy, accuracy, and professional boundaries while also considering specific scenarios like crisis situations and cultural competency. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging communication technologies or platforms.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, there are notable overlaps, particularly in privacy protection (Specs 9 and 13) and professional consultation redirection (Specs 6 and 15). These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. The redundancy in these areas slightly reduces the score.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, offering flexibility in implementation. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed cultural competency assessments, which may be challenging to implement universally. This specificity slightly impacts practicality.\n\nTOTAL=80",
