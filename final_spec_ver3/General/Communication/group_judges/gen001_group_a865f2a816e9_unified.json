    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on communication safety, accuracy, and user protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the repetition slightly detracts from the overall unity.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including bias, deception, impersonation, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as crisis detection and professional liability. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on accessibility or multilingual support, which are critical in communication domains.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs related to summarization and PII masking. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular types of deception or impersonation, which may limit adaptability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=73",
