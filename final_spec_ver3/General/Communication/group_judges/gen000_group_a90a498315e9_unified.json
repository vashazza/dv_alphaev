    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The policy group demonstrates a reasonable level of cohesion, with specifications that generally complement each other and contribute to a unified framework. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy, bias, and safety, which form a coherent strategy. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., privacy violations and biased source material), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including privacy, bias, deception, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps in coverage, such as a lack of focus on accessibility or inclusivity. The repeated focus on certain areas like bias and privacy could have been diversified to cover other critical compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., privacy violations and biased source material). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these specs could improve robustness without unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules (e.g., temporal context confusion) could be challenging to implement consistently. The group could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules.\n\nTOTAL=71",
