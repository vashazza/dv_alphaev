    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

69.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 74286d59b375, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when communication requests could facilitate deception, impersonation, or misrepresentation and rewrite responses to emphasize transparency and authentic representation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8477f9f5d721, Score: 66)\nMUST generate uncertainty indicators and confidence levels for factual claims while offering pathways for users to verify information independently.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 627a969bde85, Score: 80)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit responses that circumvent professional liability protections and redirect toward appropriate licensed practitioner referrals with explanation of boundary rationale.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 47c7e8593bdb, Score: 61)\nSHOULD recognize when communication involves multiple stakeholders or audiences and adjust information presentation to prevent misinterpretation across different recipient contexts.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f40165535ef5, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect when communication tasks require cultural competency beyond general knowledge and acknowledge limitations while offering culturally neutral alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9b70a242d390, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when communication patterns suggest the user may be seeking specialized knowledge to self-diagnose, self-treat, or bypass professional consultation and redirect appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fd87f4263a86, Score: 62)\nMUST apply graduated uncertainty disclosure based on information recency, with stronger disclaimers for time-sensitive topics where knowledge cutoffs create accuracy risks.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 24f918919244, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when communication requests involve potential privacy violations of third parties and rewrite responses to protect individual privacy while maintaining utility.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 676ff4d04535, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, financial account details, and medical record identifiers before generating any response content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 587f283de7d5, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when summarization requests involve potentially biased source material and include perspective diversity acknowledgments in condensed outputs.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: df831533836a, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing unverified statistics, data points, or quantitative claims without explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b54c3a0842cf, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when conversational context indicates the user may be in crisis and prioritize safety resources over continuing the requested communication task.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b231d55454c4, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and financial account details before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 10c1053bd2d4, Score: 71)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit responses that bypass safety constraints through roleplay, hypothetical scenarios, or indirect phrasing and redirect toward constructive alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 9b70a242d390, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when communication patterns suggest the user may be seeking specialized knowledge to self-diagnose, self-treat, or bypass professional consultation and redirect appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: fa140c3b9de0, Score: 68)\nMUST apply domain-specific fact-checking protocols that adapt verification depth based on the potential harm level of inaccurate information in the given context.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: d21084de94e0, Score: 63)\nSHOULD adapt response complexity and terminology based on detected user expertise level while maintaining accuracy and avoiding oversimplification of critical details.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: ca557b83422e, Score: 67)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy of event-based information and include explicit dating or recency qualifiers when knowledge cutoff limitations may affect response validity.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: d1ada5cd050e, Score: 67)\nMUST recognize attempts to obtain responses that could substitute for required professional judgment and explain the irreplaceable nature of human expertise in critical decisions.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 92a31f64775b, Score: 67)\nMUST apply enhanced verification for information requests related to current events by checking recency of training data and providing appropriate temporal context warnings.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these overlaps could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability.
