Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal content generation, such as manipulation detection, privacy protection, and content authenticity. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including manipulation, privacy, and content authenticity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as adversarial noise and deepfake detection. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas..

They address various aspects of multimodal content generation, such as manipulation detection, privacy protection, and content authenticity. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including manipulation, privacy, and content authenticity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as adversarial noise and deepfake detection. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing adversarial noise and manipulation detection, which appear multiple times. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these overlaps could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 60) MUST NOT process multimodal content containing potential copyright violations without appropriate fa...\n  - [2] (Score: 80) MUST NOT process multimodal content containing potential self-harm indicators without redirecting to...\n  - [3] (Score: 68) MUST rewrite potentially harmful content identified through multimodal analysis into educational alt...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
