Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for managing multimodal tasks. They address various aspects of safety, compliance, and user protection, such as bias, misinformation, and PII. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including bias, misinformation, and user safety. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as self-harm indicators and adversarial prompts. However, there are minor gaps in addressing other potential risks, such as data privacy beyond PII.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior and self-harm indicators). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those targeting coordinated inauthentic behavior, which could limit flexibility in implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling mu...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal content, including manipulation, ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic co...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT generate synthetic multimodal content that could be mistaken for authentic documentation, evidence, or professi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
