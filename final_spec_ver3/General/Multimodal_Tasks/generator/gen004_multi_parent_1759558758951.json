Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safety, compliance, and ethical considerations in multimodal tasks. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on preventing misuse and ensuring data integrity. However, some specs appear redundant, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including bias, misinformation, PII protection, and accessibility. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling self-harm indicators and adversarial prompts. There are minor gaps in addressing other potential risks, such as data privacy beyond PII.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs related to PII masking and coordinated inauthentic behavior detection. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar requirements could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could complicate implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including manipulation, pr...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic co...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT generate synthetic multimodal content that could be mistaken for authentic documentation, evidence, or professi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
