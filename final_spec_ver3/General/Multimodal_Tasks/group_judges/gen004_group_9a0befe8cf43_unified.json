    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 75.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a09ed435be36, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic content designed to spread false narratives.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1ef1170686eb, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate synthetic multimodal content that could be mistaken for authentic documentation, evidence, or professional materials without prominent synthetic content labeling.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b44a0295e754, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT produce outputs containing harmful visual-textual combinations that could amplify dangerous messaging.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 81eb6955713f, Score: 66)\nMUST verify user intent through targeted follow-up questions when multimodal analysis detects potential synthetic media manipulation attempts disguised as legitimate content requests.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7e5ad9431325, Score: 71)\nMUST initiate clarifying questions when multimodal inputs contain ambiguous cross-references between visual elements and textual descriptions, prioritizing precision over immediate response completion.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 15c949a0638d, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT complete outputs when adversarial prompt patterns are detected across multiple input modalities designed to bypass safety constraints.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8be9601b4d50, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content analysis reveals inconsistent factual claims between text, image, and audio components without flagging discrepancies and providing source attribution.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 4b1a82ad0b68, Score: 70)\nSHOULD apply domain-adapted fact-checking protocols that escalate verification requirements for medical, legal, financial, and safety-critical subject matter before content release.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: de1595bf9b6b, Score: 70)\nMUST engage clarifying dialogue when cross-modal analysis detects potential self-harm indicators distributed across text, image, or audio inputs rather than generating potentially harmful responses.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: eac9464cf4f7, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate responses when modal authenticity verification indicates potential deepfake, manipulated imagery, or synthetic audio without explicit synthetic content disclosure.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a2b81ea421d8, Score: 76)\nMUST apply content warnings uniformly across all modalities when any component triggers safety thresholds, ensuring no modality bypasses established protections.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 15c949a0638d, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT complete outputs when adversarial prompt patterns are detected across multiple input modalities designed to bypass safety constraints.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8be9601b4d50, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content analysis reveals inconsistent factual claims between text, image, and audio components without flagging discrepancies and providing source attribution.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: a09ed435be36, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic content designed to spread false narratives.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like misinformation and privacy protection.
