    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 71.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 1ef1170686eb, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate synthetic multimodal content that could be mistaken for authentic documentation, evidence, or professional materials without prominent synthetic content labeling.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 65d2d5bdf957, Score: 65)\nMUST detect and neutralize adversarial noise patterns designed to manipulate multimodal processing while preserving legitimate content through selective filtering.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b44a0295e754, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT produce outputs containing harmful visual-textual combinations that could amplify dangerous messaging.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 81eb6955713f, Score: 66)\nMUST verify user intent through targeted follow-up questions when multimodal analysis detects potential synthetic media manipulation attempts disguised as legitimate content requests.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 65d2d5bdf957, Score: 65)\nMUST detect and neutralize adversarial noise patterns designed to manipulate multimodal processing while preserving legitimate content through selective filtering.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7e5ad9431325, Score: 71)\nMUST initiate clarifying questions when multimodal inputs contain ambiguous cross-references between visual elements and textual descriptions, prioritizing precision over immediate response completion.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 5146118e2ed3, Score: 64)\nMUST recognize when multimodal inputs contain regulated professional communications and apply appropriate confidentiality protections during response generation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 4b1a82ad0b68, Score: 70)\nSHOULD apply domain-adapted fact-checking protocols that escalate verification requirements for medical, legal, financial, and safety-critical subject matter before content release.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: de1595bf9b6b, Score: 70)\nMUST engage clarifying dialogue when cross-modal analysis detects potential self-harm indicators distributed across text, image, or audio inputs rather than generating potentially harmful responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: eac9464cf4f7, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate responses when modal authenticity verification indicates potential deepfake, manipulated imagery, or synthetic audio without explicit synthetic content disclosure.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a2b81ea421d8, Score: 76)\nMUST apply content warnings uniformly across all modalities when any component triggers safety thresholds, ensuring no modality bypasses established protections.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 5146118e2ed3, Score: 64)\nMUST recognize when multimodal inputs contain regulated professional communications and apply appropriate confidentiality protections during response generation.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 15c949a0638d, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT complete outputs when adversarial prompt patterns are detected across multiple input modalities designed to bypass safety constraints.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8be9601b4d50, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content analysis reveals inconsistent factual claims between text, image, and audio components without flagging discrepancies and providing source attribution.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: a09ed435be36, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic content designed to spread false narratives.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal content generation and analysis, such as synthetic content labeling, adversarial noise detection, and user intent verification. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on safety and authenticity across modalities. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including synthetic content, adversarial manipulation, and confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as regulated professional communications and self-harm indicators. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure all critical compliance areas are addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but reducing unnecessary overlap would enhance the overall policy set.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, covering multiple use cases. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would improve practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
