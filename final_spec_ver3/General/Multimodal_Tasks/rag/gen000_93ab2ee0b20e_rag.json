    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of multimodal content generation and analysis. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as manipulation detection, content labeling, and privacy protection. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated specification for detecting adversarial noise patterns (SPEC 3 and SPEC 8), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including manipulation, privacy, copyright, and factual consistency. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as adversarial noise and deepfake detection. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging threats or novel multimodal interactions that could be explored further.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as the repeated specification for adversarial noise patterns (SPEC 3 and SPEC 8). This could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, but further consolidation could enhance clarity and reduce overlap.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed follow-up questions or specific content labeling, which may complicate implementation and maintenance in real-world scenarios."
