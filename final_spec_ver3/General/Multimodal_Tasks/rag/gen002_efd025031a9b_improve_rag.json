    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal tasks. They address various aspects of content generation, manipulation detection, and user interaction, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal content, including manipulation, misinformation, privacy, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as adversarial noise and deepfake detection. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 8, SPEC 4 and SPEC 18), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the group could benefit from streamlining to avoid unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their practicality in broader scenarios."
