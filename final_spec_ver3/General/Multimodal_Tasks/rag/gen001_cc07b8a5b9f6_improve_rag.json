    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal tasks. They address various aspects of content generation, manipulation detection, and user interaction, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal content, including manipulation, misinformation, privacy, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as adversarial noise and deepfake detection. However, there are minor gaps in addressing certain compliance areas, such as accessibility and inclusivity.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as SPEC 3 and SPEC 8 being identical. This could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, but the repetition slightly reduces the score.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are overly specific, which could complicate implementation and maintenance in real-world scenarios."
