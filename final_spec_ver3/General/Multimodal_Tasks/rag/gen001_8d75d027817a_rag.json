    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for multimodal task safety and compliance. They address various aspects of security, such as detecting malicious content, ensuring semantic coherence, and protecting PII. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in PII masking, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including security, misinformation, accessibility, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as prompt injection and adversarial patterns. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging threats and evolving compliance standards.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to PII masking (Specs 13, 15, and 17), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, excessive overlap can lead to inefficiencies. The group could benefit from more streamlined requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios."
