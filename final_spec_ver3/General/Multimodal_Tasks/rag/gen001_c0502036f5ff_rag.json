    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for multimodal tasks. They address various aspects of safety, compliance, and integrity across different modalities. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in the handling of PII and adversarial prompts, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including security, misinformation, accessibility, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or novel attack vectors.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications related to PII detection and adversarial prompt handling, with multiple specs addressing similar issues. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be reduced without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation. Streamlining these could enhance their applicability."
