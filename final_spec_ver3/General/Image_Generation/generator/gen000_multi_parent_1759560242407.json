Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of image generation safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different types of harmful content and providing alternative solutions. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including misinformation, harmful stereotypes, privacy concerns, and illegal activities. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or new forms of digital manipulation..

They complement each other by covering different types of harmful content and providing alternative solutions. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including misinformation, harmful stereotypes, privacy concerns, and illegal activities. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or new forms of digital manipulation.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 14, SPEC 2 and SPEC 18, SPEC 9 and SPEC 19), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible solutions for multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, which could complicate implementation and maintenance in real-world scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 59) SHOULD identify requests that could perpetuate historical trauma or genocide denial and offer educat...\n  - [2] (Score: 66) MUST identify generation requests that could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and engage in constructi...\n  - [3] (Score: 65) MUST identify prompts requesting images that could enable surveillance evasion or privacy circumvent...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
