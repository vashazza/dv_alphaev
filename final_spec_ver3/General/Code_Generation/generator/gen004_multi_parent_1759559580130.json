  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring code safety, security, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of code generation, such as syntax validation, security vulnerabilities, and ethical considerations. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repetition of syntax validation in SPEC 1 and SPEC 16, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, and compliance with standards. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SQL injection and cryptographic weaknesses. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific industry regulations, which could enhance coverage.. Redundancy: While there is some redundancy, such as the repetition of syntax validation in SPEC 1 and SPEC 16, the group generally avoids unnecessary duplication. The redundancy present is mostly appropriate, providing robustness in critical safety areas like security and privacy. However, further consolidation could improve efficiency without sacrificing coverage.. Practicality: The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT output executable code containing hardcoded credentials, unsafe system calls, or unvalidated input handling wit...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security vulnerabilities, eth...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing requirements and regulatory compliance constraints before generating code for healthc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security vulnerabilities, eth...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing requirements and regulatory compliance constraints before generating code for healthc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on code...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including security vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, and b...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when requested code patterns suggest potential misuse scenarios and engage in clarifying dialogue about ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when requested code patterns suggest potential misuse scenarios and engage in clarifying dialogue about ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security, privacy, ethical co...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing requirements and regulatory compliance constraints before generating code for healthc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring code safety, security, and compliance.
