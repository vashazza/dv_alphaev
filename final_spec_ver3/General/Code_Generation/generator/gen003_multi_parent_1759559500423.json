Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for safe and compliant code generation. They cover various aspects of security, accessibility, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as error handling, security vulnerabilities, and accessibility. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 1, SPEC 17 and SPEC 15) that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including security vulnerabilities, accessibility, and compliance with professional standards. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling SQL injections and ensuring accessibility. However, there are minor gaps, such as a lack of focus on performance optimization or environmental considerations.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 1, SPEC 17 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on certain vulnerabilities, which could limit adaptability in diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on enhancing c...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including security vulnerabilities, accessibility,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 62): MUST rewrite requests for code with unclear error handling into responses that demonstrate proper exception management a...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST rewrite requests for code with unclear error handling into responses that demonstrate proper exception management a...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on secu...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including secur...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 62): MUST rewrite requests for code with unclear error handling into responses that demonstrate proper exception management a...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST rewrite requests for code with unclear error handling into responses that demonstrate proper exception management a...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT output executable code containing hardcoded credentials, unsafe system calls, or unvalidated input handling wit...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on security,...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including regulatory compli...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing requirements and regulatory compliance constraints before generating code for healthc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST detect when code generation requests could impact accessibility, internationalization, or cross-platform compatibil...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST transform code generation requests that could enable privilege escalation into properly scoped alternatives with le...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on code...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including security vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, and b...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when requested code patterns suggest potential misuse scenarios and engage in clarifying dialogue about ...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for safe and compliant code generation.
