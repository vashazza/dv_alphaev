Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on enhancing code safety, security, and compliance. They address various aspects of code generation, such as error handling, security vulnerabilities, and compliance with professional standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in code generation, including security vulnerabilities, accessibility, privacy, and compliance. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling SQL injections and ensuring accessibility. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with identical specs (SPEC 1 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and suggestions for safer practices. However, some specs are overly specific, which might limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible rules could enhance adaptability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT output executable code containing hardcoded credentials, unsafe system calls, or unvalidated input handling wit...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security vulnerabilities, eth...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing requirements and regulatory compliance constraints before generating code for healthc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security vulnerabilities, eth...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing requirements and regulatory compliance constraints before generating code for healthc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on code...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including security vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, and b...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when requested code patterns suggest potential misuse scenarios and engage in clarifying dialogue about ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when requested code patterns suggest potential misuse scenarios and engage in clarifying dialogue about ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security, privacy, ethical co...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify professional licensing requirements and regulatory compliance constraints before generating code for healthc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on enhancing code safety, security, and compliance.
