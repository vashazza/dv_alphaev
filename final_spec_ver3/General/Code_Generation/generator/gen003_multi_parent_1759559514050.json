Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of code generation safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different domains such as security, accessibility, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies, such as the repeated spec on automated decision-making systems, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security vulnerabilities, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic code and accessibility barriers.

They complement each other by covering different domains such as security, accessibility, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies, such as the repeated spec on automated decision-making systems, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security vulnerabilities, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic code and accessibility barriers. However, there are minor gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific industry standards.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with the repeated spec on automated decision-making systems. While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive overlap.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in narrow scenarios, slightly affecting practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 80) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including email addresses, ph...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including email addresses, ph...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate code for automated decision-making systems affecting human welfare without explici...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
