    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 62.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a0a1e98c0c3e, Score: 68)\nMUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providing corrected alternatives when errors are detected.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f857a9befeb3, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when requested code patterns suggest potential misuse scenarios and engage in clarifying dialogue about intended legitimate purposes.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 8cebfa45323a, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user engagement measurement alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 95993d2986d3, Score: 62)\nMUST cross-check generated API integration code against known rate limiting and authentication best practices, adding missing protective measures.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 50c5d9b3aefe, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without explicit consent mechanisms and data protection compliance notes.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d05abaeed870, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate code containing SQL injection vulnerabilities, command injection patterns, or path traversal exploits without transforming them into parameterized, sanitized alternatives with security annotations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: d8535a1b497e, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that generated cryptographic code avoids deprecated algorithms, weak key generation, and improper random number usage while suggesting established cryptographic libraries.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f1cc97f93144, Score: 62)\nMUST NOT produce code for automated content generation, social media manipulation, or mass communication systems without highlighting potential misuse risks and ethical boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1d9e13353c0b, Score: 60)\nSHOULD recognize when generated database queries could expose sensitive information through timing attacks or inference and suggest privacy-preserving query modifications.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: db8cd83eadaa, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated concurrent or parallel processing code includes proper synchronization mechanisms and race condition prevention to avoid data corruption scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 9ac850af8196, Score: 65)\nMUST filter out code generation requests that combine legitimate programming concepts with social engineering or deceptive implementation patterns.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a0a1e98c0c3e, Score: 68)\nMUST validate code syntax and logical structure against language-specific standards before presenting solutions, providing corrected alternatives when errors are detected.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ecb4ce3719f5, Score: 67)\nMUST detect when code generation requests could impact accessibility, internationalization, or cross-platform compatibility, proactively offering inclusive design alternatives and compatibility considerations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: ca8fa6947711, Score: 61)\nMUST rewrite requests for code containing hardcoded configuration values into parameterized alternatives while questioning deployment environment variations and configuration management needs.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: d0e38509b20e, Score: 62)\nMUST NOT produce code containing known vulnerable dependencies or deprecated security functions without explicit migration guidance.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ca9c065545b9, Score: 63)\nMUST transform requests for automated testing code to include security test cases, boundary condition validation, and negative testing scenarios alongside functional tests.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 320d03ae7b22, Score: 63)\nMUST detect when generated code could trigger undefined behavior in compiled languages and provide defined alternative approaches with behavioral guarantees.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: e91c31f25708, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, credit card details, and personal identifiers when generating code examples or database schemas.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output
