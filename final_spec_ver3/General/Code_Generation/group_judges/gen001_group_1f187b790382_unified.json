    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

compliance constraints before generating code for healthcare, financial, or safety-critical applications.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b341f06fb75a, Score: 75)\nMUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward compliant financial data analysis examples with appropriate regulatory disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d896faa1dda0, Score:

offering legitimate security testing alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d8535a1b497e, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that generated cryptographic code avoids deprecated algorithms, weak key generation, and improper random number usage while suggesting established cryptographic libraries.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 47e944782eef, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate code for automated decision-making systems affecting

decision-making systems affecting human welfare without explicit disclaimers about professional review requirements and ethical considerations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8cebfa45323a, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite

produce code that stores sensitive data in plain text, logs, or client-side storage without offering encrypted alternatives and secure storage patterns.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d05abaeed870, Score:

security annotations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: c7b4f6f1ddce, Score: 80)\nMUST validate code generation requests against known malicious patterns and transform them into educational examples that demonstrate secure alternatives while explaining associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a27c3d55a45a, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT output code that could create denial-of-service conditions or resource exhaustion without modifying the approach to include rate limiting and resource management safeguards.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8cebfa45323a, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user engagement measurement alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f5dcfe7b89b7, Score: 82)\nMUST detect and refuse requests for code that bypasses content

However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and their associated risks.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specs, with several specifications being repeated verbatim. While this provides robustness in critical areas, it also indicates inefficiency that could be streamlined.
