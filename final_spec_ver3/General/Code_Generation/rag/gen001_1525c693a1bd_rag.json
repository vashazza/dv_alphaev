    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on security, error handling, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of code generation, such as security vulnerabilities, accessibility, and regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in code generation, including security vulnerabilities, accessibility, and compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling SQL injections and ensuring accessibility. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover other potential risks in code generation comprehensively.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with identical specs (SPEC 1 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and suggestions for safer practices. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across different contexts."
