    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of code generation safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of security, privacy, and ethical considerations. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated specification for validating code syntax (SPEC 1 and SPEC 12), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerabilities, privacy issues, and ethical concerns. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as SQL injection prevention and cryptographic code verification. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and trends, which could enhance the coverage further.",
    "redundancy": "While the group maintains robustness by addressing critical safety areas, there is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification for code syntax validation (SPEC 1 and SPEC 12). This duplication could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the redundancy is not excessive, but there is room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular vulnerabilities or scenarios, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts."
