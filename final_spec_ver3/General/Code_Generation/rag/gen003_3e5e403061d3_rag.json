    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for safe and compliant code generation. They cover various aspects of security, accessibility, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as error handling, security vulnerabilities, and accessibility. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 1, SPEC 17 and SPEC 15) that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including security vulnerabilities, accessibility, and compliance with professional standards. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling SQL injections and ensuring accessibility. However, there are minor gaps, such as a lack of focus on performance optimization or environmental considerations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 1, SPEC 17 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on certain vulnerabilities, which could limit adaptability in diverse contexts."
