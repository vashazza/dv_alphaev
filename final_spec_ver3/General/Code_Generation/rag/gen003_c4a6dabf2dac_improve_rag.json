    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of code generation safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different domains such as security, accessibility, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies, such as the repeated spec on automated decision-making systems, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including security vulnerabilities, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic code and accessibility barriers. However, there are minor gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific industry standards.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with the repeated spec on automated decision-making systems. While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive overlap.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in narrow scenarios, slightly affecting practicality."
