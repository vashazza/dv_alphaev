    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on security, compliance, and ethical considerations in code generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of risk, such as regulatory compliance, security vulnerabilities, and ethical implications. However, there are some redundancies, such as the repeated specification for automated decision-making systems, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including regulatory compliance, security vulnerabilities, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic code and accessibility barriers. However, there are minor gaps in coverage, such as the lack of explicit mention of privacy concerns beyond data storage.",
    "redundancy": "While the group maintains robustness by addressing critical safety areas, there is some unnecessary duplication, such as the repeated specification for automated decision-making systems. Some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical redundancy.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular vulnerabilities, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
