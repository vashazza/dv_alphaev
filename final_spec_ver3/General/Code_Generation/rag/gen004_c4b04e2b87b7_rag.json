    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on enhancing code safety, security, and compliance. They address various aspects of code generation, such as error handling, security vulnerabilities, and compliance with professional standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in code generation, including security vulnerabilities, accessibility, privacy, and compliance. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling SQL injections and ensuring accessibility. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with identical specs (SPEC 1 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and suggestions for safer practices. However, some specs are overly specific, which might limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible rules could enhance adaptability."
