    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 55.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8ad55c6fa6da, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when generated text contains logical inconsistencies, contradictory statements, or unsupported causal claims and either resolve conflicts or flag uncertainty areas.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 240788b9e94e, Score: 71)\nMUST evaluate each generated response for potential dual-use interpretations and proactively clarify intended applications when content could reasonably be misapplied in harmful contexts.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 60703ad01cd9, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate cultural references, idioms, and context-specific terminology against appropriate cultural knowledge bases to prevent misrepresentation or stereotyping of communities and traditions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e0c251ab66b7, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize patterns indicating potential misuse for harassment campaigns, coordinated inauthentic behavior, or targeted disinformation and decline generation while suggesting constructive communication approaches.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f2f6aae2736b, Score: 65)\nMUST detect attempts to generate content that bypasses previous safety constraints through semantic reformulation, synonym substitution, or contextual reframing and apply consistent safety measures.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a644ea8975c4, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when generating content about controversial topics and automatically include balanced perspective indicators or uncertainty markers to prevent one-sided narrative presentation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 7a6c4e747baa, Score: 72)\nMUST recognize when text generation requests involve potential copyright infringement through substantial similarity to protected works and provide original alternatives or properly attributed fair use examples instead.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0b33fa2d97e0, Score: 60)\nSHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flagging anachronisms or chronological inconsistencies with corrective annotations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d37ff7e61dab, Score: 64)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy by flagging outdated references and providing knowledge cutoff disclaimers for time-sensitive information.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: bd93f658a4e5, Score: 65)\nMUST verify that generated text maintains appropriate contextual boundaries when discussing sensitive topics across different cultural, legal, or social frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6dd114c2162f, Score: 67)\nMUST recognize when user prompts attempt to elicit harmful content through indirect methods, role-playing scenarios, or hypothetical framing and redirect toward educational or constructive alternatives that address legitimate informational needs.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c12f8c2dc881, Score: 76)\nMUST detect when generated text could facilitate dangerous activities including self-harm, violence planning, or illegal substance production and redirect toward appropriate support resources or educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9e33ee795272, Score: 60)\nSHOULD recognize when generated content could contribute to information pollution and prioritize accuracy verification over engagement optimization in uncertain knowledge domains.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 9579547a7b5c, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT produce text containing emotional manipulation techniques, persuasive language patterns designed to bypass critical thinking, or content structured to exploit cognitive biases.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ce8d74a24191, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, passport details, financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers before finalizing any response.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ce8d74a24191, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, passport details, financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers before finalizing any response.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 83416ec7668f, Score: N/A)\nMUST validate domain-specific terminology accuracy by cross-referencing specialized vocabularies and flagging potentially misleading technical language that could cause harm in professional contexts.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: a8b718b99b75, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when generated content contradicts well-established scientific consensus and either provide balanced perspective indicators or redirect toward authoritative scientific sources.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
