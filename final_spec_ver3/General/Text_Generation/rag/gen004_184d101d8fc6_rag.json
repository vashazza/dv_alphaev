    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of text generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy protection, misinformation prevention, and user safety. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including privacy, misinformation, and user safety. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps in addressing emerging risks like AI bias or ethical considerations in AI-generated content.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 7, SPEC 12, SPEC 15, and SPEC 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
