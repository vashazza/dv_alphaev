    "cohesion": "The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventing harmful content and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, such as duplicate specs (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 4, SPEC 6 and SPEC 2), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including harassment, copyright infringement, misinformation, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on accessibility or inclusivity, which are critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 4, SPEC 6 and SPEC 2, SPEC 8 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing misuse and ensuring content integrity. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit adaptability and implementation in diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
