    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in text generation. They address various aspects of privacy, misinformation, and content integrity. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 17), which slightly disrupt the cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, and content misuse, with a mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging threats like deepfakes or AI-generated fake news, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 17) and overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these could be consolidated for efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios, which could hinder adaptability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would improve practicality."
