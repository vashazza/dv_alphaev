    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventing harmful content, protecting privacy, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are present, but the repetition indicates a lack of integration in some areas.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including harassment, copyright infringement, privacy invasion, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting adversarial prompts and ensuring balanced perspectives on controversial topics. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging threats or technological advancements, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6, SPEC 5 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could improve the robustness without unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing harm and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in diverse contexts. Streamlining these could enhance practicality."
