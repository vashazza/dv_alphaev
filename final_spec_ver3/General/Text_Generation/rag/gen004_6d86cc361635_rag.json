    "cohesion": "The specs generally aim to ensure safe and responsible text generation, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and user safety. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, 18 and SPEC 11, 13), which suggests a lack of integration and coordination. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or overlaps that could have been consolidated for a more cohesive framework.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, emotional distress, and security threats. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but the repetition of certain specs suggests that some areas may be overemphasized at the expense of others. The coverage could be more balanced with additional unique specs addressing other critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy in the policy set, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, 18 and SPEC 11, 13). This repetition indicates inefficient use of resources and suggests that the policy set could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness in critical areas.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like privacy, misinformation, and user safety. However, the repetition of certain specs and the lack of unique, flexible rules that cover multiple use cases reduce the overall practicality. The policy set could benefit from more adaptable rules that are easier to implement and maintain across different contexts."
