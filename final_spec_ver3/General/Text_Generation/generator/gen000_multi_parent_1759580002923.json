Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of text generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as protecting personal information, avoiding misinformation, and ensuring clarity in communication. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including privacy, misinformation, and sensitive content. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling bias or discrimination in generated content.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
