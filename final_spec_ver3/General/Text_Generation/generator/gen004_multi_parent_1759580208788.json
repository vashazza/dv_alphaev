Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of text generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy protection, misinformation prevention, and user safety. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including privacy, misinformation, and user safety. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps in addressing emerging risks like AI bias or ethical considerations in AI-generated content.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 7, SPEC 12, SPEC 15, and SPEC 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, and user safety, with a ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST validate that creative writing outputs do not inadvertently encode real trauma experiences, private communications,...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and id...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including harassment, priva...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST NOT produce content that could facilitate harassment, doxxing, or targeted intimidation by detecting patterns assoc...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST recognize when text generation requests involve potential copyright infringement through substantial similarity to ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
