  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support systems. They address various aspects of decision-making, such as bias detection, confidence communication, and PII protection, without apparent conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as handling irreversible consequences and ensuring professional compliance, contribute to a unified safety and compliance strategy.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including cognitive biases, conflicts of interest, and PII protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as irreversible consequences and professional licensing circumvention. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly in PII protection (Specs 4, 9, and 13), which could be consolidated for efficiency. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, the overlap in certain specifications suggests room for streamlining without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as financial and cultural considerations. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of decision support scenarios, from financial and medical advice to h...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate investment or financial decision recommendations without explicit disclaimers about market volatility,...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to elicit medical, legal, or financial advice through indirect phrasing and redirect toward qualifi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ensuring decision s...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including cognitiv...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 62): MUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect when recommendation confidence levels fall below reliable thresholds and communicate uncertainty through qua...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support.
