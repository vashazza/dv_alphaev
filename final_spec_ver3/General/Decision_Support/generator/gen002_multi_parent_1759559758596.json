  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of decision support, such as safety, equity, and accuracy, forming a coherent strategy. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including adversarial prompt detection, equity considerations, confidence thresholds, and privacy. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, though some areas like data integrity and user consent could be more explicitly addressed.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 14 and SPEC 4). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support s...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including adversarial detection, equity, privacy, ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect adversarial prompts attempting to bypass decision support safety constraints and respond with safe reformula...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate eq...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
