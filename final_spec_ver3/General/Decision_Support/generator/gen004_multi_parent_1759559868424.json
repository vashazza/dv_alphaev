  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safety, equity, and accuracy in decision support. There are logical connections between requirements, such as handling uncertainty and protecting vulnerable populations. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including adversarial prompt detection, equity considerations, confidence thresholds, and privacy protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or evolving risk landscapes.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated exactly (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 6, SPEC 7 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 4). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of decision support scenarios, from financial and medical advice to h...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate investment or financial decision recommendations without explicit disclaimers about market volatility,...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to elicit medical, legal, or financial advice through indirect phrasing and redirect toward qualifi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ensuring decision s...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including cognitiv...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 62): MUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect when recommendation confidence levels fall below reliable thresholds and communicate uncertainty through qua...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support.
