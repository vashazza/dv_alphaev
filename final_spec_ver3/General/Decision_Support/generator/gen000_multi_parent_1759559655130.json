  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support safety and compliance. They address various aspects of decision-making, such as handling adversarial prompts, ensuring equity, and maintaining data privacy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including adversarial detection, equity, privacy, and evidence-based recommendations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling vulnerable populations and confidence thresholds. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit foundational rules for general decision-making processes.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 14 and SPEC 4). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by addressing various scenarios, such as indirect phrasing and confidence levels. However, some specifications could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts, and the repetition of certain rules may complicate implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
