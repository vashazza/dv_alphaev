    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safety, equity, and accuracy in decision support. There are logical connections between requirements, such as handling uncertainty and protecting vulnerable populations. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including adversarial prompt detection, equity considerations, confidence thresholds, and privacy protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or evolving risk landscapes.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated exactly (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 6, SPEC 7 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 4). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in broader scenarios."
