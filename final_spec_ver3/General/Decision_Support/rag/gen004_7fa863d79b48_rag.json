    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support systems. They address various aspects of decision-making, such as bias detection, confidence communication, and PII protection, without apparent conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as handling irreversible consequences and ensuring professional compliance, contribute to a unified safety and compliance strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including cognitive biases, conflicts of interest, and PII protection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as irreversible consequences and professional licensing circumvention. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in PII protection (Specs 4, 9, and 13), which could be consolidated for efficiency. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, the overlap in certain specifications suggests room for streamlining without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as financial and cultural considerations. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
