    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of decision support systems, such as bias detection, confidence communication, and privacy protection. They complement each other by covering different facets of decision-making processes, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like bias and PII handling that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including cognitive biases, conflicts of interest, irreversible consequences, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cultural sensitivity and professional licensing circumvention. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but further emphasis on emerging risks could enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to bias detection and PII masking, it is generally appropriate for ensuring robustness in critical safety areas. Some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap without compromising the policy's effectiveness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. The specifications are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are slightly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios, impacting overall practicality."
