    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of decision support, such as safety, equity, and accuracy, forming a coherent strategy. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including adversarial prompt detection, equity considerations, confidence thresholds, and privacy. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, though some areas like data integrity and user consent could be more explicitly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 14 and SPEC 4). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios."
