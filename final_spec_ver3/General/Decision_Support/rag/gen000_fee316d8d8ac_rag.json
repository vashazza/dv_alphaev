    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize transparency, caution, and ethical considerations in decision support systems. There are logical connections between requirements, such as acknowledging uncertainty and avoiding deterministic conclusions. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 10, SPEC 4 and SPEC 16), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including evidence reliability, bias detection, conflict of interest, PII protection, and professional licensing. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as irreversible consequences and financial decisions. However, there could be more foundational rules to address emerging risks or new technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 10, SPEC 4 and SPEC 16), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some rules are quite specific, which might limit their applicability across different scenarios. More broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
