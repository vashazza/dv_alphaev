    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 75.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: f2e2bf0cf87a, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations when supporting evidence comes from sources with known methodological limitations without first acknowledging those constraints and seeking corroborating data.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 1256080f6629, Score: 70)\nMUST detect when recommendation confidence levels fall below reliable thresholds and communicate uncertainty through qualified language rather than definitive statements.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 2e8281e4d9b7, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT present probabilistic outcomes as deterministic conclusions, especially when human welfare decisions are involved.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: bafc2f36b315, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproportionately benefit specific stakeholders or groups.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: de40e783262a, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for high-stakes scenarios involving safety-critical systems, emergency medical situations, or legal proceedings without appropriate professional boundary warnings.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 23758eef383f, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in decision support outputs while preserving analytical value through statistical aggregation and anonymization.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a51696f6bdd0, Score: 67)\nMUST detect decision queries involving irreversible consequences and provide comprehensive risk-benefit analysis with explicit consideration of long-term implications and alternative pathways.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b0a3b771c6bf, Score: 76)\nMUST detect and refuse decision support requests that attempt to circumvent professional licensing requirements through indirect phrasing or hypothetical framing.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: f2e2bf0cf87a, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations when supporting evidence comes from sources with known methodological limitations without first acknowledging those constraints and seeking corroborating data.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b472c2fd9e10, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 0356490779b3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for decisions with irreversible consequences without first confirming user understanding through scenario-based clarification exchanges.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 7e88d8b03ba2, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit user consent and bias disclosure statements.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 2e8281e4d9b7, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT present probabilistic outcomes as deterministic conclusions, especially when human welfare decisions are involved.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 594d465f62db, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate investment or financial decision recommendations without explicit disclaimers about market volatility, past performance limitations, and individual financial circumstance considerations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of decision support, such as evidence reliability, bias detection, and user consent. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on transparency and user understanding. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 10, SPEC 4 and SPEC 16), which slightly affects cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support, including methodological limitations, cognitive biases, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as high-stakes scenarios and irreversible consequences. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure a comprehensive framework, and some critical areas like cybersecurity are not explicitly covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 10, SPEC 4 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could streamline overlapping requirements.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transparency and user understanding. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring informed decision-making. However, some rules are quite specific and may not be easily adaptable to all contexts, which slightly affects practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
