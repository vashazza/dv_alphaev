    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 67.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1256080f6629, Score: 70)\nMUST detect when recommendation confidence levels fall below reliable thresholds and communicate uncertainty through qualified language rather than definitive statements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: bafc2f36b315, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproportionately benefit specific stakeholders or groups.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 23758eef383f, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in decision support outputs while preserving analytical value through statistical aggregation and anonymization.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a51696f6bdd0, Score: 67)\nMUST detect decision queries involving irreversible consequences and provide comprehensive risk-benefit analysis with explicit consideration of long-term implications and alternative pathways.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: b0a3b771c6bf, Score: 76)\nMUST detect and refuse decision support requests that attempt to circumvent professional licensing requirements through indirect phrasing or hypothetical framing.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b472c2fd9e10, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0356490779b3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for decisions with irreversible consequences without first confirming user understanding through scenario-based clarification exchanges.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 7e88d8b03ba2, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit user consent and bias disclosure statements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 594d465f62db, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate investment or financial decision recommendations without explicit disclaimers about market volatility, past performance limitations, and individual financial circumstance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 4743238688a3, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations that could amplify existing societal biases without concurrent bias disclosure and alternative perspective presentation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 6027fb51d187, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize cultural and contextual factors that may influence decision appropriateness and provide culturally sensitive alternatives when recommending courses of action.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 42bfc4fdae5f, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision support requests involve potential conflicts of interest between multiple stakeholders and restructure responses to present balanced perspectives rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 6ba5cd7880d2, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically append uncertainty quantification to any decision support involving human behavior prediction, replacing definitive behavioral forecasts with conditional probability statements.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: f2d81df0e1c5, Score: N/A)\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue sequences when detecting ambiguous pronouns or unclear referents that could lead to misattributed actions or responsibilities in guidance responses.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of decision support, such as bias detection, confidence communication, and PII protection. They complement each other by covering different facets of decision-making processes, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like PII masking and confidence level handling that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including cognitive biases, conflicts of interest, irreversible consequences, and professional licensing circumvention. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as cultural sensitivity and demographic profiling. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but further emphasis on emerging risks could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20  \nComment: While there is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to PII masking and confidence level management, it is generally appropriate for ensuring robustness in critical safety areas. However, some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap and improve efficiency without compromising the policy's effectiveness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specifications are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some rules could be overly specific, such as those requiring scenario-based clarification exchanges, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=84",
