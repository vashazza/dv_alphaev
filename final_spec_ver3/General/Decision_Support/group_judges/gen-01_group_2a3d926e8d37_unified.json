    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

without explicit disclaimers about market volatility, past performance limitations, and individual financial circumstance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: df28d3437dc0, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit medical, legal, or financial advice through indirect phrasing and redirect toward qualified professional consultation while offering general educational context.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ac47efe9e82f, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT provide recommendations for irreversible decisions affecting multiple stakeholders without first generating alternative reversible approaches and staged decision pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b472c2fd9e10, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 9334033598c4, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in all decision support outputs while preserving analytical utility through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: df8319f69321, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when foundational assumptions remain unvalidated, instead surfacing critical assumptions for user verification before proceeding with analysis.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 6ba5cd7880d2, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically append uncertainty quantification to any decision support involving human behavior prediction, replacing definitive behavioral forecasts with conditional probability statements.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: eb0cd4ebc129, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT proceed with resource allocation recommendations when detecting potential discrimination patterns, instead restructuring the analysis around equitable distribution principles and need-based criteria.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 6ba5cd7880d2, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically append uncertainty quantification to any decision support involving human behavior prediction, replacing definitive behavioral forecasts with conditional probability statements.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4743238688a3, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations that could amplify existing societal biases without concurrent bias disclosure and alternative perspective presentation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: dc4bb0b7e0f7, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate predictions extending beyond validated model confidence intervals without explicit extrapolation warnings and methodology transparency.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 594d465f62db, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate investment or financial decision recommendations without explicit disclaimers about market volatility, past performance limitations, and individual financial circumstance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9334033598c4, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in all decision support outputs while preserving analytical utility through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 6027fb51d187, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize cultural and contextual factors that may influence decision appropriateness and provide culturally sensitive alternatives when recommending courses of action.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 42bfc4fdae5f, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision support requests involve potential conflicts of interest between multiple stakeholders and restructure responses to present balanced perspectives rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: de40e783262a, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for high-stakes scenarios involving safety-critical systems, emergency medical situations, or legal proceedings without appropriate professional boundary

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes caution, transparency, and ethical considerations in decision support. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of decision-making, such as uncertainty, bias, and stakeholder impact. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including financial, medical, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cultural sensitivity and conflict of interest. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or data privacy beyond anonymization.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There are notable redundancies, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 7) and overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly reducing practicality.\n\nTOTAL=78",
