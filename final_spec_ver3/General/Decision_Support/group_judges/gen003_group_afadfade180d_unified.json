    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

without explicit disclaimers about market volatility, past performance limitations, and individual financial circumstance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: df28d3437dc0, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit medical, legal, or financial advice through indirect phrasing and redirect toward qualified professional consultation while offering general educational context.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ac47efe9e82f, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT provide recommendations for irreversible decisions affecting multiple stakeholders without first generating alternative reversible approaches and staged decision pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b472c2fd9e10, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 9334033598c4, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in all decision support outputs while preserving analytical utility through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: df8319f69321, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when foundational assumptions remain unvalidated, instead surfacing critical assumptions for user verification before proceeding with analysis.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: eb0cd4ebc129, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT proceed with resource allocation recommendations when detecting potential discrimination patterns, instead restructuring the analysis around equitable distribution principles and need-based

limitations, and individual financial circumstance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9334033598c4, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in all decision

involving safety-critical systems, emergency medical situations, or legal proceedings without appropriate professional boundary warnings.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: de40e783262a, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for high-stakes scenarios involving safety-critical systems, emergency medical situations, or legal proceedings without appropriate professional boundary warnings.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support. They emphasize caution in providing recommendations, ensuring that decisions are well-informed and considerate of various factors such as confidence levels, stakeholder impact, and professional boundaries.

It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling high-stakes scenarios and ensuring equitable resource distribution. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging risks or rapidly changing domains.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 1, SPEC 10 and SPEC 5, SPEC 13 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability.
