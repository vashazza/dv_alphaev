    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 63.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1256080f6629, Score: 70)\nMUST detect when recommendation confidence levels fall below reliable thresholds and communicate uncertainty through qualified language rather than definitive statements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: bafc2f36b315, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproportionately benefit specific stakeholders or groups.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 23758eef383f, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in decision support outputs while preserving analytical value through statistical aggregation and anonymization.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a51696f6bdd0, Score: 67)\nMUST detect decision queries involving irreversible consequences and provide comprehensive risk-benefit analysis with explicit consideration of long-term implications and alternative pathways.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: b0a3b771c6bf, Score: 76)\nMUST detect and refuse decision support requests that attempt to circumvent professional licensing requirements through indirect phrasing or hypothetical framing.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b472c2fd9e10, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0356490779b3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for decisions with irreversible consequences without first confirming user understanding through scenario-based clarification exchanges.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 7e88d8b03ba2, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit user consent and bias disclosure statements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 594d465f62db, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate investment or financial decision recommendations without explicit disclaimers about market volatility, past performance limitations, and individual financial circumstance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 12f134e02eb8, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial account numbers, social security identifiers, and biometric data patterns within all decision support outputs.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 89061fba0c3d, Score: N/A)\nMUST validate specialized terminology accuracy by cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources before incorporating domain-specific concepts into responses.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b3067b7f01c8, Score: 68)\nMUST detect adversarial prompts attempting to bypass decision support safety constraints and respond with safe reformulations maintaining helpful intent.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 93fec95feecb, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate equity-adjusted alternatives alongside standard recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: b3067b7f01c8, Score: 68)\nMUST detect adversarial prompts attempting to bypass decision support safety constraints and respond with safe reformulations maintaining helpful intent.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of decision support, such as bias detection, confidence communication, PII masking, and professional licensing compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on transparency and ethical considerations. However, there is some overlap in PII masking (Specs 4, 9, and 13), which could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including cognitive biases, conflicts of interest, irreversible consequences, and demographic profiling. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as financial decision disclaimers and adversarial prompt detection. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or evolving regulatory landscapes.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly in PII masking (Specs 4, 9, and 13) and adversarial prompt detection (Specs 15 and 17). While redundancy can enhance robustness, these overlaps could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical areas like confidence communication and irreversible consequences, but further consolidation could enhance clarity.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as financial and medical decision-making. However, some rules are overly specific, like the detailed PII masking requirements, which may complicate implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
