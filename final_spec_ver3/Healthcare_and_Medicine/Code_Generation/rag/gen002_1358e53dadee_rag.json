    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare code generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of code generation, such as authentication, dosage calculations, and data privacy, without evident conflicts. The logical connections between requirements form a coherent strategy, emphasizing the importance of professional validation and secure practices.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including authentication, data privacy, and clinical calculations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as jurisdiction-specific licensing and emergency response systems. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with multiple specifications addressing authentication bypass and secure access patterns. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising robustness. The repetition of similar requirements suggests room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, emphasizing the need for professional oversight and secure practices. However, some specifications could be overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability in broader scenarios."
