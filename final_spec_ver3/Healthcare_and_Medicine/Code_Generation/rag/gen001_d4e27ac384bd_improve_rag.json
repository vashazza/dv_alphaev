    "cohesion": "The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as ensuring FHIR compliance and safeguarding life-critical systems. However, some specs are repetitive, and there are minor inconsistencies in how similar issues are addressed, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interoperability, life-critical systems, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as genetic data processing and telemedicine. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of emphasis on general cybersecurity measures or broader data protection principles.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in specs related to life-critical systems and clinical trial randomization, which could be consolidated for efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar requirements without significant differentiation suggests room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit safety certifications or professional reviews, which may be challenging to implement consistently. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
