    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare code generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of code generation, such as authentication, medical calculations, and data privacy. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy to ensure safety and compliance.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas like authentication, data privacy, and medical calculations. However, there could be more emphasis on general principles to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing authentication bypass (Specs 2, 12, and 13). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more concise to enhance real-world implementation and maintenance."
