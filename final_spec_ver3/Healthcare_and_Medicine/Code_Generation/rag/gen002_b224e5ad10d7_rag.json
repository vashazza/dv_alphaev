    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on safety, privacy, and compliance in healthcare code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as error handling, privacy protection, and oversight in critical systems. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 15), which slightly disrupts cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, safety, and compliance with medical standards. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as telemedicine and life-critical systems. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and interoperability standards.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as requiring sandbox environments and privacy measures. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability across different contexts."
