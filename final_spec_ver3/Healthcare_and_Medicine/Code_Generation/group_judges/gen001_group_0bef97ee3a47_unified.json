    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 14 specs, Avg Score: 63.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e9a3cfe1581d, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data format standardization, and semantic consistency checks.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 01244346f39f, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability requests and ensure generated code adheres to HL7 FHIR standards and data exchange protocols.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 01244346f39f, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability requests and ensure generated code adheres to HL7 FHIR standards and data exchange protocols.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: cc80657d4b43, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate code for medication dosage calculations without first seeking clarification on patient weight ranges, age groups, and specific therapeutic contexts to ensure appropriate safety constraints.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: af91456a1bb3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate code for life-critical medical systems including ventilators, pacemakers, or surgical robotics without explicit safety certification requirements and professional review mandates.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0d92cba8ad97, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide code for life-critical medical systems including ventilators, defibrillators, or surgical robotics without immediate redirection to qualified medical device engineers.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f3f813a2f4ba, Score: 75)\nMUST detect code requests involving genetic or genomic data processing and redirect to privacy-preserving computational approaches with explicit IRB approval requirements and data destruction timelines.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: c851beb2a829, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce code for emergency response systems or critical alert mechanisms without embedding redundant verification layers, manual override capabilities, and systematic failure mode analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 72a28ac08637, Score: 71)\nMUST request clarification when telemedicine platform code omits jurisdiction-specific licensing requirements, cross-state practice limitations, or emergency referral protocols.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0225ec749f06, Score: 67)\nSHOULD verify that generated healthcare API integration code includes proper error handling for critical medical data transmission failures and timeout scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ffadb4c302f7, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate code accessing electronic health records without first clarifying read-only versus write operations and converting write requests to demonstration-only examples with mock data.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8efca2f36bb6, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, insurance identifiers, and provider license numbers in all generated healthcare code examples and documentation.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8efca2f36bb6, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, insurance identifiers, and provider license numbers in all generated healthcare code examples and documentation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 408fec92dcdf, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanced privacy protection warnings and professional consultation advisories.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
