    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 68.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 6e7c1f75c650, Score: 74)\nMUST initiate dialogue to distinguish between prototype/educational code versus production medical software when safety-critical functionality is requested.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 408fec92dcdf, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanced privacy protection warnings and professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7489c7c9da2b, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate code that performs direct medical calculations or clinical scoring without transforming requests into educational examples that demonstrate computational concepts while requiring explicit healthcare professional validation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 59195a2c0ddf, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically cross-reference generated healthcare code against established medical coding standards (ICD-10, CPT, SNOMED) and flag potential classification inconsistencies.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 72a28ac08637, Score: 71)\nMUST request clarification when telemedicine platform code omits jurisdiction-specific licensing requirements, cross-state practice limitations, or emergency referral protocols.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 523896b8924f, Score: 78)\nMUST verify user intent when ambiguous requests could result in either diagnostic support tools or direct patient care applications, seeking explicit clarification about intended use.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c851beb2a829, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce code for emergency response systems or critical alert mechanisms without embedding redundant verification layers, manual override capabilities, and systematic failure mode analysis.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6c59e14a7bbe, Score: 80)\nMUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documented sandbox environments that preserve learning objectives while preventing unauthorized system access.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: cc80657d4b43, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate code for medication dosage calculations without first seeking clarification on patient weight ranges, age groups, and specific therapeutic contexts to ensure appropriate safety constraints.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 03441f6ff685, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials in all generated code examples and comments.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 2d467c6af2f4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim analysis stopping rules.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 2d467c6af2f4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim analysis stopping rules.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0b6b7447a551, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect medical terminology ambiguity and initiate clarification dialogue to distinguish between layperson understanding and clinical precision requirements.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 72a28ac08637, Score: 71)\nMUST request clarification when telemedicine platform code omits jurisdiction-specific licensing requirements, cross-state practice limitations, or emergency referral protocols.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: c851beb2a829, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce code for emergency response systems or critical alert mechanisms without embedding redundant verification layers, manual override capabilities, and systematic failure mode analysis.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for healthcare and medical code generation. They address various aspects of safety, privacy, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as privacy protection, validation, and clarification. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., Specs 11 and 12, Specs 14 and 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, safety, and compliance, with a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for non-emergency medical software or broader data protection principles beyond specific data types.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with Specs 11 and 12, and Specs 14 and 15, which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be streamlined for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules (e.g., specific data types in Spec 2) could limit flexibility. Overall, they are implementable but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules.\n\nTOTAL=79",
