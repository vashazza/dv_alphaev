  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 85.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare code generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of code generation, such as authentication, medical calculations, and data privacy. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy to ensure safety and compliance.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas like authentication, data privacy, and medical calculations. However, there could be more emphasis on general principles to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing authentication bypass (Specs 2, 12, and 13). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more concise to enhance real-world implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on safe...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): SHOULD verify that generated healthcare API integration code includes proper error handling for critical medical data tr...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider cr...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
