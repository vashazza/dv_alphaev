  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare code generation, such as interoperability, safety, and privacy, without significant conflicts. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on safety and oversight in critical systems and data handling.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interoperability, safety, privacy, and compliance. However, there is a slight imbalance with more focus on specific edge cases (e.g., life-critical systems, genetic data) than on broad foundational rules. Some general principles could be more explicitly stated to enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar issues (e.g., life-critical systems in Specs 6 and 7, and automated treatment recommendations in Specs 3 and 13). While redundancy in critical safety areas is beneficial, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some rules are quite specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
