Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare code generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of code generation, such as authentication, dosage calculations, and data privacy, without evident conflicts. The logical connections between requirements form a coherent strategy, emphasizing the importance of professional validation and secure practices.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including authentication, data privacy, and clinical calculations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as jurisdiction-specific licensing and emergency response systems. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks..

They complement each other by addressing different aspects of code generation, such as authentication, dosage calculations, and data privacy, without evident conflicts. The logical connections between requirements form a coherent strategy, emphasizing the importance of professional validation and secure practices.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including authentication, data privacy, and clinical calculations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as jurisdiction-specific licensing and emergency response systems. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with multiple specifications addressing authentication bypass and secure access patterns. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising robustness. The repetition of similar requirements suggests room for streamlining.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, emphasizing the need for professional oversight and secure practices. However, some specifications could be overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST NOT generate code that performs direct medical calculations or clinical scoring without transfo...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate code for medication dosage calculations without first seeking clarification on pat...\n  - [3] (Score: 80) MUST NOT generate code for life-critical medical systems including ventilators, pacemakers, or surgi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
