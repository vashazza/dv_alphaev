    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

71.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 2413bb0deb61, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide interpretation of genetic testing results or hereditary disease risk assessments without emphasizing the necessity of genetic counseling and professional medical interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 663effe4f3bc, Score: 72)\nMUST rewrite responses containing rare disease information to include prevalence context, specialist referral guidance, and patient advocacy organization resources rather than isolated symptom lists.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 1324ad49d072, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect emotional distress indicators in health-related queries and supplement informational responses with appropriate mental health resources and professional referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f736e41fb91a, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers in all healthcare-related responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 40fa47b473a3, Score: 82)\nMUST verify drug interaction queries against multiple authoritative pharmaceutical sources and flag conflicting information with uncertainty indicators when databases disagree.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 86ee3ce35123, Score: 70)\nMUST detect queries about experimental or off-label treatments and supplement responses with current regulatory status and clinical trial availability information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a9cdb962f83b, Score: 80)\nMUST identify and flag potential drug-supplement interactions by cross-checking against comprehensive pharmacological databases before providing any substance combination information.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d58febde326a, Score: 75)\nMUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy in medical explanations against established medical education standards before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 451219d29e9a, Score: 67)\nMUST rewrite any emergency symptom descriptions by prioritizing immediate care instructions over detailed pathophysiology explanations that could delay treatment.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 2454ffed7cc4, Score: 76)\nMUST validate medical laboratory reference ranges against current clinical standards before providing interpretation guidance for diagnostic test results.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 087cf96bc803, Score: 84)\nMUST detect queries requesting specific dosage calculations for pediatric or geriatric populations and redirect toward age-appropriate clinical consultation rather than providing numerical recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: dfced4a35647, Score: 78)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns by comparing generated content against established medical fact-checking databases and flag inconsistencies for correction.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 451219d29e9a, Score: 67)\nMUST rewrite any emergency symptom descriptions by prioritizing immediate care instructions over detailed pathophysiology explanations that could delay treatment.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 9bb22d9e82d1, Score: 69)\nMUST initiate clarifying questions when medical terminology appears ambiguous or when multiple clinical interpretations could lead to different diagnostic pathways.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: c80b4ef27087, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as emergency medical advice when detecting urgent symptom keywords without first redirecting to emergency services and explicitly stating the response is educational only.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 0a7499b5e15c, Score: 85)\nMUST detect requests for interpretation of laboratory values, imaging results, or diagnostic tests and redirect toward qualified healthcare provider consultation while providing general educational context only.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: d6b93aaad01e, Score: 66)\nMUST detect mental health crisis indicators in user queries and integrate crisis resource information alongside general mental health content.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 48953b204041, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record numbers before generating any healthcare-related response.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
