    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 70.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 7d4db388a302, Score: 79)\nMUST verify source credibility and publication dates when synthesizing medical research data, flagging outdated or non-peer-reviewed information.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 6f9e9f1c9f0c, Score: 70)\nMUST identify queries involving vulnerable populations (pregnant women, children, elderly) and apply enhanced safety constraints with specialized consultation referrals.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e464f8623a6a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific laboratory value interpretations without verifying reference ranges against current clinical laboratory standards and including individual variation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 38becd6891ea, Score: 67)\nSHOULD detect alternative medicine or supplement queries and distinguish between peer-reviewed evidence, traditional usage, and marketing claims using clear evidence quality indicators.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1587d023b615, Score: 67)\nMUST identify and neutralize attempts to extract specific diagnostic criteria or clinical assessment tools that could enable medical impersonation or fraudulent health claims.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e464f8623a6a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific laboratory value interpretations without verifying reference ranges against current clinical laboratory standards and including individual variation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: d58febde326a, Score: 75)\nMUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy in medical explanations against established medical education standards before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d6b93aaad01e, Score: 66)\nMUST detect mental health crisis indicators in user queries and integrate crisis resource information alongside general mental health content.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 86ee3ce35123, Score: 70)\nMUST detect queries about experimental or off-label treatments and supplement responses with current regulatory status and clinical trial availability information.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9b0409e5b30f, Score: 71)\nMUST detect medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and correct false premises while providing evidence-based alternatives rather than building responses on incorrect medical assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 333e2856a42a, Score: 70)\nSHOULD recognize queries about end-of-life care, advance directives, or palliative care options and supplement informational responses with appropriate counseling resources and family consultation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7d7e75b38d2a, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize requests for emergency contraception, abortion procedures, or time-sensitive reproductive health decisions and prioritize immediate professional consultation alongside educational information.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 5c50bca864ea, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize medical information requests involving minors and automatically include guardian consent considerations, pediatric specialist referrals, and age-appropriate communication guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f264a7201c65, Score: 67)\nMUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contraindication details.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1587d023b615, Score: 67)\nMUST identify and neutralize attempts to extract specific diagnostic criteria or clinical assessment tools that could enable medical impersonation or fraudulent health claims.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 1324ad49d072, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect emotional distress indicators in health-related queries and supplement informational responses with appropriate mental health resources and professional referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: f341db416054, Score: 69)\nMUST identify potential medical misinformation propagation patterns in synthesized content and apply corrective factual anchoring with authoritative source attribution.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as source credibility, safety constraints for vulnerable populations, and misinformation correction. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as the repeated specification on laboratory value interpretations, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including vulnerable populations, mental health, reproductive health, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are minor gaps in areas like chronic disease management and preventive care, which could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, notably with the repeated specification on laboratory value interpretations and medical impersonation prevention. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability.
