    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare information processing. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting queries to healthcare professionals and ensuring the accuracy of medical information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 13 and SPEC 4), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including dosage calculations, medical misinformation, drug interactions, and emergency situations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as pediatric and geriatric dosage calculations. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 13 and SPEC 4, SPEC 16 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on redirecting to qualified professionals and maintaining safety boundaries. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like pediatric or geriatric dosage calculations, which could limit flexibility."
