    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of healthcare information processing, such as dosage calculations, emergency situations, and misinformation. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in emergency response and contraindication warnings, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including dosage calculations, emergency situations, mental health crises, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as pediatric and geriatric considerations. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of focus on chronic disease management or preventive care, which could enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as the repeated focus on contraindication warnings and emergency response. These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness. The redundancy in emergency-related specs could be reduced to streamline the policy set.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to appropriate healthcare resources. They balance security with usability by providing general educational context while avoiding specific medical advice. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring age-appropriate content delivery, which may limit adaptability across different contexts."
