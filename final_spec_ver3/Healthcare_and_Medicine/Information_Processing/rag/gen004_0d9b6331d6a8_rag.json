    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare information processing. There are logical connections between requirements, such as redirecting to healthcare providers and validating information against standards. However, there are some overlaps, such as repeated specs on drug-supplement interactions, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare information processing risks, including misinformation, drug interactions, and mental health. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling minors' information and emotional distress indicators. However, there are minor gaps in addressing certain critical areas like data privacy beyond patient identifiers.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications on drug-supplement interactions and clarifying questions. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling minors and mental health crises. However, some rules are overly specific, which could complicate implementation in diverse scenarios."
