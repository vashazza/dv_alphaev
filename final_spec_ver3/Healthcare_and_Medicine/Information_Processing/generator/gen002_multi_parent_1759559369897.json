Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, accuracy, and professional consultation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on professional guidance and the prevention of misinformation. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including genetic testing, drug interactions, mental health, and emergency situations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there could be more foundational rules to cover broader scenarios..

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on professional guidance and the prevention of misinformation. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including genetic testing, drug interactions, mental health, and emergency situations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there could be more foundational rules to cover broader scenarios.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 13 are identical). While redundancy in critical areas like emergency response is beneficial, some overlap could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some rules are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in diverse scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) SHOULD identify potential bias in medical research synthesis by checking for demographic representat...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST identify requests for medical information that could facilitate eating disorder behaviors and r...\n  - [3] (Score: 86) MUST NOT generate specific medication dosages or treatment protocols without explicitly stating that...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
