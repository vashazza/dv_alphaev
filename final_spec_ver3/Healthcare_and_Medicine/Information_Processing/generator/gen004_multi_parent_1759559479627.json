  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as misinformation detection, drug interactions, and mental health crisis management. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting to healthcare providers and ensuring information accuracy. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of healthcare information processing risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas like misinformation, mental health, and drug interactions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., drug-supplement interactions). While redundancy in critical areas is beneficial, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could benefit from reducing unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as redirecting to healthcare providers and ensuring information accuracy. However, some rules are overly specific and could be more flexible to cover multiple use cases, enhancing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.

They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as misinformation detection, drug interactions, and mental health crisis management. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting to healthcare providers and ensuring information accuracy. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of healthcare information processing risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas like misinformation, mental health, and drug interactions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance coverage.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., drug-supplement interactions). While redundancy in critical areas is beneficial, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency.
