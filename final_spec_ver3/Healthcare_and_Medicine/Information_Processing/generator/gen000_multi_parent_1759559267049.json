Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as genetic testing, drug interactions, and emergency response, without apparent conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as emphasizing professional consultation and verifying information against authoritative sources, contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy.. Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. General principles, such as verifying information against standards and redirecting to professional consultation, are well-represented. Specific protections, like handling rare diseases and mental health crises, are also included. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging healthcare technologies and digital health trends to ensure comprehensive coverage..

They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as genetic testing, drug interactions, and emergency response, without apparent conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as emphasizing professional consultation and verifying information against authoritative sources, contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. General principles, such as verifying information against standards and redirecting to professional consultation, are well-represented. Specific protections, like handling rare diseases and mental health crises, are also included. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging healthcare technologies and digital health trends to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with emergency symptom descriptions (SPEC 9 and SPEC 13) and the emphasis on redirecting to professional consultation. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling various medical queries and ensuring data privacy. However, some specifications may be overly specific, such as those focusing on rare diseases, which could limit applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) SHOULD identify potential bias in medical research synthesis by checking for demographic representat...\n  - [2] (Score: 86) MUST NOT generate specific medication dosages or treatment protocols without explicitly stating that...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST identify requests for medical information that could facilitate eating disorder behaviors and r...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
