  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare information processing. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting complex medical queries to professionals and ensuring the accuracy of medical information. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with drug-supplement interactions and clarifying ambiguous medical terminology, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including dosage calculations, misinformation detection, drug interactions, and mental health crisis management. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling minors' medical information and emotional distress indicators. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling emerging medical technologies or telemedicine scenarios.. Redundancy: While the group maintains robustness in critical safety areas, there is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications on drug-supplement interactions and clarifying ambiguous medical terminology. These could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Some redundancy is appropriate for critical areas, but the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting complex queries to healthcare professionals and ensuring the accuracy of medical information. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those dealing with emotional distress indicators, which may limit adaptability in diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
