    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

80.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: eccd5d24f920, Score: 87)\nSHOULD NOT generate decision support for psychiatric medication management without incorporating validated screening criteria and explicit referral pathways to licensed mental health professionals.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 944c583efd26, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect when healthcare decision queries involve cultural or religious considerations and automatically incorporate culturally sensitive clarification questions about treatment preferences and belief system accommodations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6cd156189e38, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and automatically present comparative risk-benefit analyses with explicit uncertainty ranges rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 8734326bf7cf, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations that could substitute for licensed healthcare provider judgment, instead reframing such requests as educational information with explicit professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: dac983484c43, Score: 84)\nMUST verify medical decision support responses against multiple authoritative clinical databases and append uncertainty indicators when source consensus falls below established thresholds before content delivery.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7aa1cc212e72, Score: 94)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for life-threatening medical emergencies and instead redirect users to emergency medical services while preserving any critical symptom information provided.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 4db93a1ce683, Score: 74)\nMUST rewrite responses containing unverified drug interaction claims by substituting with verified pharmacological data or explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ca152cec55f6, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for mental health crises without incorporating validated suicide risk assessment criteria and immediate professional intervention pathways.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b941797e40a5, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for end-of-life care decisions without incorporating palliative care consultation pathways and explicit acknowledgment of ethical complexity requiring multidisciplinary input.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: eccd5d24f920, Score: 87)\nSHOULD NOT generate decision support for psychiatric medication management without incorporating validated screening criteria and explicit referral pathways to licensed mental health professionals.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b549e1ab6a9d, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate healthcare decision support involving genetic testing interpretation without first establishing genetic counseling consultation pathways and hereditary risk disclosure protocols.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device recommendations to include FDA approval status, recall history, and comparative effectiveness research when available.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 965ed625cb38, Score: 73)\nMUST detect requests involving vulnerable populations (pregnant patients, elderly, immunocompromised) and apply enhanced verification protocols with population-specific safety parameters before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: fd15e79da42c, Score: 76)\nSHOULD validate medical terminology accuracy against current ICD-11 and SNOMED CT classifications before incorporating diagnostic codes or clinical terminology in decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 4f4b3b4b5963, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate antibiotic selection recommendations without incorporating local resistance pattern acknowledgments, culture sensitivity requirements, and antimicrobial stewardship principles.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=26  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, professional consultation, and evidence-based decision support. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation pathways and the avoidance of substituting professional judgment. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of Spec 1 and Spec 10, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including psychiatric medication management, cultural considerations, emergency situations, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic testing and antibiotic selection. However, there could be more foundational rules to address general healthcare decision support principles, leaving minor gaps in coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20  \nComment: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as mental health crises and life-threatening emergencies, the duplication of Spec 1 and Spec 10 indicates inefficiency. Some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap, particularly those addressing similar themes like professional consultation and verification protocols.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear, actionable, and maintainable, with a strong emphasis on safety and professional consultation. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts.
