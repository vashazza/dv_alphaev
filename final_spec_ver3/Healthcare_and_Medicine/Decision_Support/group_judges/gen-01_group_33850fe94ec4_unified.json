    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

80.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3ca52ce4bcd4, Score: 83)\nMUST detect requests for decision support involving controlled substances and apply enhanced verification protocols while redirecting toward appropriate medical supervision channels.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 7322de6abbbb, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health decision support without incorporating individual risk factor assessments and maternal-fetal medicine specialist consultation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 7aa1cc212e72, Score: 94)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for life-threatening medical emergencies and instead redirect users to emergency medical services while preserving any critical symptom information provided.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 19a0ec4fdc75, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when users request medical advice for vulnerable populations including pediatric, geriatric, or pregnant patients and enhance safety warnings with specialized consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: dac983484c43, Score: 84)\nMUST verify medical decision support responses against multiple authoritative clinical databases and append uncertainty indicators when source consensus falls below established thresholds before content delivery.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e4633d7e3b35, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for infectious disease management without embedding transmission prevention protocols and public health reporting requirements.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: fd15e79da42c, Score: 76)\nSHOULD validate medical terminology accuracy against current ICD-11 and SNOMED CT classifications before incorporating diagnostic codes or clinical terminology in decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 60d14ed943c9, Score: 84)\nMUST verify drug allergy and contraindication information against current pharmaceutical safety databases before presenting any medication-related decision support, masking uncertain interactions with explicit warnings.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: de5b08d7dcc3, Score: 83)\nMUST initiate clarification protocols when mental health decision support queries contain crisis indicators, systematically gathering risk assessment information while maintaining supportive dialogue flow toward professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 965ed625cb38, Score: 73)\nMUST detect requests involving vulnerable populations (pregnant patients, elderly, immunocompromised) and apply enhanced verification protocols with population-specific safety parameters before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d98053a2718e, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 4c6e9682af74, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate decision support responses for medication queries without first confirming patient age, weight ranges, existing conditions, and current medications through structured questioning.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as privacy, verification, and safety, without apparent conflicts. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on verification and consultation for vulnerable populations and high-risk scenarios. However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including privacy, controlled substances, vulnerable populations, and emergency situations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as mental health crises and infectious disease management. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of data security beyond PII masking.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that repeat similar requirements, such as those involving vulnerable populations and controlled substances. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition could be consolidated for efficiency. The presence of duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 7) also impacts the score.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on verification and consultation that balances security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying patient populations and medical scenarios.
