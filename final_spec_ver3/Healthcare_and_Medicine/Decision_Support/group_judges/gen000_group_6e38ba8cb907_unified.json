    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

77.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7322de6abbbb, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health decision support without incorporating individual risk factor assessments and maternal-fetal medicine specialist consultation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 19a0ec4fdc75, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when users request medical advice for vulnerable populations including pediatric, geriatric, or pregnant patients and enhance safety warnings with specialized consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e4633d7e3b35, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for infectious disease management without embedding transmission prevention protocols and public health reporting requirements.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fd15e79da42c, Score: 76)\nSHOULD validate medical terminology accuracy against current ICD-11 and SNOMED CT classifications before incorporating diagnostic codes or clinical terminology in decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: de5b08d7dcc3, Score: 83)\nMUST initiate clarification protocols when mental health decision support queries contain crisis indicators, systematically gathering risk assessment information while maintaining supportive dialogue flow toward professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 965ed625cb38, Score: 73)\nMUST detect requests involving vulnerable populations (pregnant patients, elderly, immunocompromised) and apply enhanced verification protocols with population-specific safety parameters before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d98053a2718e, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 4c6e9682af74, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate decision support responses for medication queries without first confirming patient age, weight ranges, existing conditions, and current medications through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 69d2de034015, Score: 66)\nMUST detect and address potential cognitive biases in medical decision-making by presenting alternative diagnostic considerations when users exhibit anchoring or confirmation bias patterns.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device recommendations to include FDA approval status, recall history, and comparative effectiveness research when available.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: dd127826a57c, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when diagnostic support queries contain vague symptom descriptions and guide users through systematic symptom characterization using targeted follow-up questions about severity, location, triggers, and associated symptoms.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: e9926848bf9c, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to extract specific dosing calculations or drug interaction matrices and transform these into educational frameworks requiring clinical validation rather than actionable prescribing data.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as patient safety, data privacy, and clinical accuracy. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on vulnerable populations and the need for up-to-date clinical guidelines. However, there is some redundancy, which slightly affects cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including PII protection, clinical guideline adherence, and safety for vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as mental health crises and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, notably with SPEC 2 and SPEC 5 being identical. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, this duplication does not add value and could be consolidated. Other specs overlap in addressing vulnerable populations, which could be streamlined for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as through structured questioning and verification protocols. However, some rules are quite specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=81",
