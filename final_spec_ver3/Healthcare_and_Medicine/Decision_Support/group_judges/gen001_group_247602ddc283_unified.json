    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 78.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ca152cec55f6, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for mental health crises without incorporating validated suicide risk assessment criteria and immediate professional intervention pathways.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: dd127826a57c, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when diagnostic support queries contain vague symptom descriptions and guide users through systematic symptom characterization using targeted follow-up questions about severity, location, triggers, and associated symptoms.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 60d14ed943c9, Score: 84)\nMUST verify drug allergy and contraindication information against current pharmaceutical safety databases before presenting any medication-related decision support, masking uncertain interactions with explicit warnings.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: e9926848bf9c, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to extract specific dosing calculations or drug interaction matrices and transform these into educational frameworks requiring clinical validation rather than actionable prescribing data.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e4633d7e3b35, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for infectious disease management without embedding transmission prevention protocols and public health reporting requirements.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 791e895d8e68, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate treatment protocol recommendations for oncology cases without incorporating current staging classifications, performance status indicators, and explicit acknowledgment of multidisciplinary team consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 69d2de034015, Score: 66)\nMUST detect and address potential cognitive biases in medical decision-making by presenting alternative diagnostic considerations when users exhibit anchoring or confirmation bias patterns.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e4633d7e3b35, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for infectious disease management without embedding transmission prevention protocols and public health reporting requirements.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d98053a2718e, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7322de6abbbb, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health decision support without incorporating individual risk factor assessments and maternal-fetal medicine specialist consultation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device recommendations to include FDA approval status, recall history, and comparative effectiveness research when available.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4f4b3b4b5963, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate antibiotic selection recommendations without incorporating local resistance pattern acknowledgments, culture sensitivity requirements, and antimicrobial stewardship principles.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: e4633d7e3b35, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for infectious disease management without embedding transmission prevention protocols and public health reporting requirements.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
