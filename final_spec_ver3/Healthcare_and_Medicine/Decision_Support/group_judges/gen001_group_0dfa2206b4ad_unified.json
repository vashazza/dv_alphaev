    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 84.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ca152cec55f6, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for mental health crises without incorporating validated suicide risk assessment criteria and immediate professional intervention pathways.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 60d14ed943c9, Score: 84)\nMUST verify drug allergy and contraindication information against current pharmaceutical safety databases before presenting any medication-related decision support, masking uncertain interactions with explicit warnings.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d98053a2718e, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 7322de6abbbb, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health decision support without incorporating individual risk factor assessments and maternal-fetal medicine specialist consultation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7aa1cc212e72, Score: 94)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for life-threatening medical emergencies and instead redirect users to emergency medical services while preserving any critical symptom information provided.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: dac983484c43, Score: 84)\nMUST verify medical decision support responses against multiple authoritative clinical databases and append uncertainty indicators when source consensus falls below established thresholds before content delivery.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 60d14ed943c9, Score: 84)\nMUST verify drug allergy and contraindication information against current pharmaceutical safety databases before presenting any medication-related decision support, masking uncertain interactions with explicit warnings.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3ca52ce4bcd4, Score: 83)\nMUST detect requests for decision support involving controlled substances and apply enhanced verification protocols while redirecting toward appropriate medical supervision channels.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7aa1cc212e72, Score: 94)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for life-threatening medical emergencies and instead redirect users to emergency medical services while preserving any critical symptom information provided.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: dac983484c43, Score: 84)\nMUST verify medical decision support responses against multiple authoritative clinical databases and append uncertainty indicators when source consensus falls below established thresholds before content delivery.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 60d14ed943c9, Score: 84)\nMUST verify drug allergy and contraindication information against current pharmaceutical safety databases before presenting any medication-related decision support, masking uncertain interactions with explicit warnings.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 3ca52ce4bcd4, Score: 83)\nMUST detect requests for decision support involving controlled substances and apply enhanced verification protocols while redirecting toward appropriate medical supervision channels.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare decision support. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.

There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but the repetition of certain specs suggests potential gaps in other areas that could have been addressed instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of identical or nearly identical rules (e.g., specs 6 and 3, specs 10, 14, and 2, specs 12 and 8). While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency and a need for consolidation.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and compliance.
