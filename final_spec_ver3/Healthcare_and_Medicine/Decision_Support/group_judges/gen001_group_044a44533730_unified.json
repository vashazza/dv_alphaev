    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7322de6abbbb, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health decision support without incorporating individual risk factor assessments and maternal-fetal medicine specialist consultation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 19a0ec4fdc75, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when users request medical advice for vulnerable populations including pediatric, geriatric, or pregnant patients and enhance safety warnings with specialized consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e4633d7e3b35, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for infectious disease management without embedding transmission prevention protocols and public health reporting requirements.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fd15e79da42c, Score:

responses.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: de5b08d7dcc3, Score: 83)\nMUST initiate clarification protocols when mental health decision support queries contain crisis indicators, systematically gathering risk assessment information while maintaining supportive dialogue flow toward professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 965ed625cb38, Score: 73)\nMUST detect requests involving vulnerable populations (pregnant patients, elderly, immunocompromised) and apply enhanced verification protocols with population-specific safety parameters before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d98053a2718e, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 4c6e9682af74, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate decision support responses for medication queries without first confirming patient age, weight ranges, existing conditions, and current medications through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 4b6c6600ac76, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient names, birth dates, social security numbers, and insurance identifiers while preserving clinically relevant demographic categories necessary for accurate guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: abbdf4806873, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient names, birth dates, social security numbers, and insurance identifiers while preserving clinically relevant demographic information necessary for accurate guidance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4f4b3b4b5963, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate antibiotic selection recommendations without incorporating

infectious disease management without embedding transmission prevention protocols and public health reporting requirements.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 791e895d8e68, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate treatment protocol recommendations for oncology cases without incorporating current staging classifications, performance status indicators, and explicit acknowledgment of multidisciplinary team consultation

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as PII masking, validation against clinical guidelines, and special considerations for vulnerable populations.

However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for non-vulnerable populations and broader medication management beyond antibiotics and controlled substances.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 16) and overlapping requirements for PII masking (e.g., SPEC 1, SPEC 13, and SPEC 14). While redundancy can enhance safety, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as embedding transmission prevention protocols and validating medical terminology.
