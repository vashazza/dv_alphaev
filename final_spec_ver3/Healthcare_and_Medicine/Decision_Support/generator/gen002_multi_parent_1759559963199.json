Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as patient safety, data privacy, and clinical accuracy. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on vulnerable populations and the need for up-to-date clinical guidelines. However, there is some redundancy, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including PII protection, clinical guideline adherence, and safety for vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as mental health crises and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine..

They address various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as patient safety, data privacy, and clinical accuracy. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on vulnerable populations and the need for up-to-date clinical guidelines. However, there is some redundancy, which slightly affects cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including PII protection, clinical guideline adherence, and safety for vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as mental health crises and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, notably with SPEC 2 and SPEC 5 being identical. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, this duplication does not add value and could be consolidated. Other specs overlap in addressing vulnerable populations, which could be streamlined for efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as through structured questioning and verification protocols. However, some rules are quite specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) MUST detect and address potential cognitive biases in medical decision-making by presenting alternat...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST detect when users request medical advice for vulnerable populations including pediatric, geriat...\n  - [3] (Score: 79) MUST detect queries involving vulnerable populations including minors, pregnant individuals, and eld...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
