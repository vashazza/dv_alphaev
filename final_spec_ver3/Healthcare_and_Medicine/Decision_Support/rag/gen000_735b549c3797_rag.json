    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, professional consultation, and evidence-based decision support. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation pathways and the avoidance of substituting professional judgment. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of Spec 1 and Spec 10, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including psychiatric medication management, cultural considerations, emergency situations, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic testing and antibiotic selection. However, there could be more foundational rules to address general healthcare decision support principles, leaving minor gaps in coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as mental health crises and life-threatening emergencies, the duplication of Spec 1 and Spec 10 indicates inefficiency. Some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap, particularly those addressing similar themes like professional consultation and verification protocols.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear, actionable, and maintainable, with a strong emphasis on safety and professional consultation. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those involving genetic testing and antibiotic selection, which could limit flexibility in broader scenarios."
