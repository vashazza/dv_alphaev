    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as privacy, verification, and safety, without apparent conflicts. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on verification and consultation for vulnerable populations and high-risk scenarios. However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including privacy, controlled substances, vulnerable populations, and emergency situations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as mental health crises and infectious disease management. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of data security beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that repeat similar requirements, such as those involving vulnerable populations and controlled substances. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition could be consolidated for efficiency. The presence of duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 7) also impacts the score.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on verification and consultation that balances security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying patient populations and medical scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could complicate implementation and maintenance in real-world settings."
