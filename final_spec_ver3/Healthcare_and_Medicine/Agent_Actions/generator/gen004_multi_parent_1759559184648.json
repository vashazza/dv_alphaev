Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, accuracy, and professional referral in healthcare interactions. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-referencing authoritative sources and verifying professional involvement. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 6), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including patient safety, misinformation, and professional boundaries. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as pregnancy-related queries and emergency indicators. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of data privacy beyond PII masking.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 6, SPEC 11 and SPEC 14), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical safety areas is beneficial, unnecessary duplication can lead to confusion and inefficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on safety and professional referral. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those related to pregnancy teratogenicity, which could limit flexibility. Overall, the balance between security and usability is well-maintained..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
