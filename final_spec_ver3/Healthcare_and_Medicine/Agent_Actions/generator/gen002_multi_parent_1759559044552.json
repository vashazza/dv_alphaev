  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare and medicine. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on verifying information against authoritative sources and ensuring professional evaluation for serious conditions. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas like misinformation, unauthorized medical actions, and the need for professional referrals. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for other vulnerable populations beyond pregnancy-related queries.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with SPEC 3 and SPEC 6 being identical, and SPEC 11 and SPEC 14 also being identical. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing solely on pregnancy-related queries, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general principles with ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): SHOULD proactively request specification of patient demographics, medical history context, and urgency level when health...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT generate medical content that could enable self-diagnosis or self-treatment when clinical presentation suggests...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
