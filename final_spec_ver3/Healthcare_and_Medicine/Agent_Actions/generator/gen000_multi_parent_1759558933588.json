  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes patient safety, data security, and appropriate response to medical queries. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on clinician authorization, encryption, and crisis intervention. However, some specs could be better integrated to avoid overlap.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including patient data security, medication interactions, and emergency scenarios. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as pregnancy-related queries and psychiatric emergencies. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for non-emergency medical advice or routine healthcare interactions.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeating similar requirements, such as those related to data security and clinician authorization. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition of specs like those involving encryption and authentication could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and patient safety. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as emergency and non-emergency scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to pregnancy teratogenicity, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
