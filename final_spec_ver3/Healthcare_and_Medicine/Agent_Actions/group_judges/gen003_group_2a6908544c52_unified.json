    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 84.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b1f9b33d0a7d, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT execute healthcare-related actions that modify patient treatment plans or medication regimens without explicit confirmation of licensed clinician authorization and documented supervisory approval.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 2ba6de750ea3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate responses to medication interaction queries without first establishing complete medication lists, supplement usage, and known allergic reactions through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: af85559e4de7, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT execute any healthcare-related actions involving patient data transmission, appointment scheduling, or medical record access without end-to-end encryption verification and HIPAA compliance confirmation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f8b2356fe215, Score: 90)\nMUST pause response generation when detecting queries about self-harm, suicidal ideation, or severe psychiatric emergencies and redirect users toward crisis intervention resources with appropriate contact information.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1aa961c27cff, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT execute actions that could alter patient records, medical device settings, or clinical workflows without explicit healthcare provider authentication.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9f5fd405022b, Score: 90)\nMUST NOT provide responses to emergency medical scenarios involving chest pain, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness, or breathing difficulties without immediately redirecting to emergency services contact information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e23e723239aa, Score: 78)\nSHOULD proactively request specification of patient demographics, medical history context, and urgency level when healthcare questions lack sufficient clinical detail for safe guidance.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: b345bf22d1de, Score: 81)\nMUST identify when medical advice requests exceed general health information boundaries and redirect toward licensed healthcare provider consultation with specific referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e23e723239aa, Score: 78)\nSHOULD proactively request specification of patient demographics, medical history context, and urgency level when healthcare questions lack sufficient clinical detail for safe guidance.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: af85559e4de7, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT execute any healthcare-related actions involving patient data transmission, appointment scheduling, or medical record access without end-to-end encryption verification and HIPAA compliance confirmation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 1aa961c27cff, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT execute actions that could alter patient records, medical device settings, or clinical workflows without explicit healthcare provider authentication.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 2ba6de750ea3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate responses to medication interaction queries without first establishing complete medication lists, supplement usage, and known allergic reactions through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9f5fd405022b, Score: 90)\nMUST NOT provide responses to emergency medical scenarios involving chest pain, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness, or breathing difficulties without immediately redirecting to emergency services contact information.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1aa961c27cff, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT execute actions that could alter patient records, medical device settings, or clinical workflows without explicit healthcare provider authentication.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 069332d764ed, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT execute actions that could influence medical device operations, patient monitoring systems, or clinical alert mechanisms without verified healthcare provider authorization and established safety protocols.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

They complement each other by addressing different aspects of healthcare actions, such as authorization, encryption, and emergency response.

It balances general principles with specific scenarios, such as emergency situations and medication interactions. However, there are some gaps in addressing non-emergency but still critical healthcare scenarios, such as chronic disease management.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. This repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here is excessive and could be streamlined without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability by emphasizing clinician authorization and compliance with regulations like HIPAA.
