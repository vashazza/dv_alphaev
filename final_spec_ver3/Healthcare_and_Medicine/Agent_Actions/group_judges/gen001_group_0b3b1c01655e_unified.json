    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 81.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b345bf22d1de, Score: 81)\nMUST identify when medical advice requests exceed general health information boundaries and redirect toward licensed healthcare provider consultation with specific referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b345bf22d1de, Score: 81)\nMUST identify when medical advice requests exceed general health information boundaries and redirect toward licensed healthcare provider consultation with specific referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d845886194d9, Score: 72)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and respond with authoritative source corrections rather than amplifying unsubstantiated health claims.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d845886194d9, Score: 72)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and respond with authoritative source corrections rather than amplifying unsubstantiated health claims.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 6fb6996e1a27, Score: 76)\nMUST initiate confirmation dialogues when medical emergency indicators appear in user queries to verify appropriate professional medical contact has been established.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 069332d764ed, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT execute actions that could influence medical device operations, patient monitoring systems, or clinical alert mechanisms without verified healthcare provider authorization and established safety protocols.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 6131363ec5ee, Score: 81)\nMUST verify the clinical context and intended use case when users request medical action execution, distinguishing between educational, research, and direct patient care scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9f5fd405022b, Score: 90)\nMUST NOT provide responses to emergency medical scenarios involving chest pain, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness, or breathing difficulties without immediately redirecting to emergency services contact information.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f7d8d1dcb973, Score: 84)\nMUST automatically cross-validate any generated medication information against current FDA databases and drug interaction matrices before presenting pharmaceutical guidance to users.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 50478d9ac0dd, Score: 85)\nMUST verify the scope of requested medical actions against established boundaries for AI-assisted healthcare tools, automatically downgrading high-risk requests to informational responses with appropriate professional referrals.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: c8b5d4209b09, Score: 85)\nMUST pause response generation when detecting requests for medical actions or system integrations and require explicit confirmation of healthcare setting, user role, and supervisory oversight through guided questioning.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 2ba6de750ea3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate responses to medication interaction queries without first establishing complete medication lists, supplement usage, and known allergic reactions through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3983eb00a096, Score: 79)\nSHOULD recognize when medical questions require specialist knowledge beyond general practice scope and guide users toward appropriate subspecialty consultation rather than providing generalized responses.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: e23e723239aa, Score: 78)\nSHOULD proactively request specification of patient demographics, medical history context, and urgency level when healthcare questions lack sufficient clinical detail for safe guidance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1aa961c27cff, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT execute actions that could alter patient records, medical device settings, or clinical workflows without explicit healthcare provider authentication.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize safety, compliance, and the importance of professional healthcare oversight. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting to healthcare providers and verifying information against authoritative sources. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including emergency scenarios, misinformation, medication guidance, and device interactions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency redirection and medication interaction checks. There are minor gaps in addressing non-emergency but still critical scenarios, such as chronic disease management.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs 1 and 2, and specs 3 and 4, which are identical. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated. The rest of the specs maintain appropriate redundancy without unnecessary overlap.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by requiring verification and professional consultation. However, some specs could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts, and the repetition of certain rules may complicate implementation.\n\nTOTAL=81",
