    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 14 specs, Avg Score: 66.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b1f9b33d0a7d, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT execute healthcare-related actions that modify patient treatment plans or medication regimens without explicit confirmation of licensed clinician authorization and documented supervisory approval.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 2ba6de750ea3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate responses to medication interaction queries without first establishing complete medication lists, supplement usage, and known allergic reactions through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: af85559e4de7, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT execute any healthcare-related actions involving patient data transmission, appointment scheduling, or medical record access without end-to-end encryption verification and HIPAA compliance confirmation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 7e8e4df46517, Score: 76)\nMUST detect when medical queries contain emotional distress indicators and prioritize mental health resource information over clinical content generation while maintaining supportive dialogue tone.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 33e692e02c40, Score: 73)\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when medical queries contain ambiguous symptom descriptions that could indicate multiple differential diagnoses requiring professional assessment.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 43b13902b3c4, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize pregnancy-related medical queries and append teratogenicity warnings for medications while including maternal-fetal medicine specialist referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e23e723239aa, Score: 78)\nSHOULD proactively request specification of patient demographics, medical history context, and urgency level when healthcare questions lack sufficient clinical detail for safe guidance.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: b345bf22d1de, Score: 81)\nMUST identify when medical advice requests exceed general health information boundaries and redirect toward licensed healthcare provider consultation with specific referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e23e723239aa, Score: 78)\nSHOULD proactively request specification of patient demographics, medical history context, and urgency level when healthcare questions lack sufficient clinical detail for safe guidance.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: af85559e4de7, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT execute any healthcare-related actions involving patient data transmission, appointment scheduling, or medical record access without end-to-end encryption verification and HIPAA compliance confirmation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 2ba6de750ea3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate responses to medication interaction queries without first establishing complete medication lists, supplement usage, and known allergic reactions through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 67e482172e6a, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and protected health information before generating any response containing clinical data or case discussions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: c336b7b6a333, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect ambiguous symptom descriptions and prompt users to specify duration, severity scale, associated factors, and temporal patterns before generating health-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 43b13902b3c4, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize pregnancy-related medical queries and append teratogenicity warnings for medications while including maternal-fetal medicine specialist referral guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability, such as ensuring clinician authorization and HIPAA compliance.
