    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize safety, compliance, and the importance of professional healthcare oversight. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting to healthcare providers and verifying information against authoritative sources. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including emergency scenarios, misinformation, medication guidance, and device interactions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency redirection and medication interaction checks. There are minor gaps in addressing non-emergency but still critical scenarios, such as chronic disease management.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs 1 and 2, and specs 3 and 4, which are identical. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated. The rest of the specs maintain appropriate redundancy without unnecessary overlap.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by requiring verification and professional consultation. However, some specs could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts, and the repetition of certain rules may complicate implementation."
