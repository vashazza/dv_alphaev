    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes patient safety, data security, and clinician oversight. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on clinician authorization and data protection. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including patient data security, emergency response, and medication management. It balances general principles with specific scenarios, such as emergency situations and psychiatric emergencies. However, there could be more emphasis on other critical areas like telemedicine or digital health tools.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple specs repeating the same or very similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 3). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here is excessive and could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on security and clinician involvement. They are adaptable to various healthcare contexts and balance security with usability. However, the repetition of certain specs could complicate implementation and maintenance."
