    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

drug interaction classifications without first clarifying complete medication lists, supplement usage, and herbal remedies through comprehensive pharmaceutical history dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID:

monitoring recommendations from clinical pharmacology guidelines.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1f006d233a5e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize infectious disease transmission risks, quarantine requirements, or public health measures without including current public health authority guidance and local health department contact information.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7415806e6e93, Score: 70)\nMUST validate medical terminology against current clinical standards before assigning healthcare categories, substituting outdated terms with contemporary equivalents.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 510dea23f5c7, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize treatment effectiveness or prognosis without statistical confidence bounds, population-specific considerations, and individual outcome variability acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID:

advance directive information, and specialized support services over categorical responses.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: cf75c350abef, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when classification boundaries overlap between emergency and non-emergency medical categories and default to higher acuity classification with appropriate referral language.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID:

life-threatening conditions, self-harm indicators, or acute medical emergencies.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 74d404661d78, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to medical conditions without establishing baseline functional status through targeted questions about daily activities, mobility, and quality of life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a142fbf6afc1, Score: 70)\nMUST identify and flag
