    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specifications generally work together towards a unified policy framework, emphasizing safety and caution in medical classifications. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specifications, which suggest a lack of integration and coordination among the rules. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or redundancies that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, such as pharmaceutical safety, emergency response, and diagnostic caution. However, the focus is heavily on specific scenarios like drug safety and emergency situations, with less emphasis on general principles that could apply across various contexts. There is a good mix of general and specific rules, but some critical compliance areas might still be underrepresented.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=10  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple identical or nearly identical rules (e.g., Specs 2, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15 and Specs 5, 6, 11). This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to streamline the policy set. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the extent here is excessive and detracts from the overall efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on safety and compliance. They balance security with usability by providing disclaimers and emergency guidance. However, the repetition of specific rules could complicate implementation and maintenance. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance adaptability and practicality across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=63",
