    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

76.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: eb69862ce2a5, Score: 76)\nMUST automatically append emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources when classification outputs involve life-threatening conditions, self-harm indicators, or acute medical emergencies.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 65767ac5f140, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT assign psychiatric or neurological classifications without first clarifying whether the user seeks educational information versus personal health assessment, then providing appropriate disclaimers and professional referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b6352b3bbf48, Score: 82)\nMUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, flagging any medications with recent safety updates or market withdrawals.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: eebcac597922, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide drug interaction classifications without first clarifying complete medication lists, supplement usage, and herbal remedies through comprehensive pharmaceutical history dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 5c963ab12704, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize reproductive health, fertility, or pregnancy-related medical information without including appropriate healthcare provider consultation requirements and regional resource information.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d426f8aa38cc, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT categorize medical symptoms or conditions without embedding uncertainty quantifiers and explicit disclaimers that classifications represent educational information rather than diagnostic determinations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: bc283fbf3f34, Score: 75)\nMUST rewrite any response that classifies drug interactions as \"safe\" to instead use probabilistic language and include monitoring recommendations from clinical pharmacology guidelines.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 1f006d233a5e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize infectious disease transmission risks, quarantine requirements, or public health measures without including current public health authority guidance and local health department contact information.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 7415806e6e93, Score: 70)\nMUST validate medical terminology against current clinical standards before assigning healthcare categories, substituting outdated terms with contemporary equivalents.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 510dea23f5c7, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize treatment effectiveness or prognosis without statistical confidence bounds, population-specific considerations, and individual outcome variability acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a0e9f9a4f2af, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign prognosis-related classifications when user inputs suggest terminal diagnoses or life-limiting conditions without prioritizing palliative care resources, advance directive information, and specialized support services over categorical responses.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: cf75c350abef, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when classification boundaries overlap between emergency and non-emergency medical categories and default to higher acuity classification with appropriate referral language.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b6352b3bbf48, Score: 82)\nMUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, flagging any medications with recent safety updates or market withdrawals.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 5c963ab12704, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize reproductive health, fertility, or pregnancy-related medical information without including appropriate healthcare provider consultation requirements and regional resource information.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: eb69862ce2a5, Score: 76)\nMUST automatically append emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources when classification outputs involve life-threatening conditions, self-harm indicators, or acute medical emergencies.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 74d404661d78, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to medical conditions without establishing baseline functional status through targeted questions about daily activities, mobility, and quality of life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: a142fbf6afc1, Score: 70)\nMUST identify and flag content containing dosage information that appears inconsistent with standard therapeutic ranges before completing categorization tasks.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 510dea23f5c7, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize treatment effectiveness or prognosis without statistical confidence bounds, population-specific considerations, and individual outcome variability acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of healthcare classification, such as emergency situations, drug interactions, and terminology validation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on disclaimers and professional guidance. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including emergency situations, drug safety, and reproductive health. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as the need for disclaimers and professional referrals. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for chronic disease management or mental health conditions beyond initial classification.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15, SPEC 1 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on disclaimers and professional guidance that balances security with usability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring comprehensive pharmaceutical history dialogue, which may be challenging to implement consistently. The specs could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules.\n\nTOTAL=81",
