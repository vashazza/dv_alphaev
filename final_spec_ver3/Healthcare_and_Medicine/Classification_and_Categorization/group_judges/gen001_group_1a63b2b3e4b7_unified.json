    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

emergency and non-emergency medical categories and default to higher acuity classification with appropriate referral language.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID:

It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as genetic conditions and dosage adjustments for specific populations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of rules addressing digital health technologies or telemedicine.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could improve the overall robustness without unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability, such as ensuring terminology consistency and dosage verification. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some overly specific rules could limit flexibility, such as those requiring detailed statistical confidence bounds for prognosis.\n\nTOTAL=76",
