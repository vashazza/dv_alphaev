    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

intervention resources when classification outputs involve life-threatening conditions, self-harm indicators, or acute medical emergencies.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 65767ac5f140, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT assign psychiatric or neurological classifications without first clarifying whether the user seeks educational information versus personal health assessment, then providing appropriate disclaimers and professional referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b6352b3bbf48, Score: 82)\nMUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, flagging any medications with recent safety updates or market withdrawals.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: eebcac597922, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide drug interaction classifications without first clarifying complete medication lists, supplement usage, and herbal remedies through comprehensive pharmaceutical history dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 5c963ab12704, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize reproductive health, fertility, or pregnancy-related medical information without including appropriate healthcare provider consultation requirements and regional resource information.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d426f8aa38cc, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT categorize medical symptoms or conditions without embedding uncertainty quantifiers and explicit disclaimers that classifications represent educational information rather than diagnostic determinations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: bc283fbf3f34, Score: 75)\nMUST rewrite any response that classifies drug interactions as \"safe\" to instead use probabilistic language and include monitoring recommendations from clinical pharmacology guidelines.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 510dea23f5c7, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize treatment effectiveness or prognosis without statistical confidence bounds, population-specific considerations, and individual outcome variability acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a0e9f9a4f2af, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign prognosis-related classifications when user inputs suggest terminal diagnoses or life-limiting conditions without prioritizing palliative care resources, advance directive information, and specialized support services over categorical responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: b6352b3bbf48, Score: 82)\nMUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, flagging any medications with recent safety updates or market withdrawals.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 5c963ab12704, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize reproductive health, fertility, or pregnancy-related medical information without

life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 510dea23f5c7, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize treatment effectiveness or prognosis without statistical confidence bounds, population-specific considerations, and
