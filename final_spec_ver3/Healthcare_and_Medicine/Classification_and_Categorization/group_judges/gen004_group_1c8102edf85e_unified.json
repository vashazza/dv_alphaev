    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 20 specs, Avg Score: 79.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ca948e02862a, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individuals or protected health records.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 0fabd497b388, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record numbers before presenting any medical classification results.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 80c4709594fa, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when classification involves genetic or hereditary conditions and apply enhanced confidentiality measures while including genetic counseling referral information and family screening considerations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f1a57dce2596, Score: 88)\nMUST detect classification requests involving controlled substances or prescription medications and redirect toward licensed pharmacist or physician consultation rather than providing categorical information.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b7d3f2fb7d91, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign mental health categories to behavioral descriptions without including validated screening tool references and licensed mental health professional referral pathways.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a311acbcf7f4, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when medical classification outputs could enable medication abuse or self-harm behaviors and rewrite responses to emphasize harm reduction and professional support resources.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: be7fcab3350a, Score: 74)\nMUST detect when medical classification outputs contain dosage information and verify against pediatric, geriatric, and organ impairment dosing adjustments before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 72992de95569, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign surgical procedure classifications without verifying against current medical coding standards and surgical specialty board recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d426f8aa38cc, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT categorize medical symptoms or conditions without embedding uncertainty quantifiers and explicit disclaimers that classifications represent educational information rather than diagnostic determinations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: be7fcab3350a, Score: 74)\nMUST detect when medical classification outputs contain dosage information and verify against pediatric, geriatric, and organ impairment dosing adjustments before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 25cffbacea40, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference medical classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources including ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, and current clinical practice guidelines to verify category accuracy and flag discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: de4584772a6e, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT categorize medical imaging findings or laboratory values as pathological without prefacing outputs with \"pattern recognition only\" disclaimers and radiologist verification requirements.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7415806e6e93, Score: 70)\nMUST validate medical terminology against current clinical standards before assigning healthcare categories, substituting outdated terms with contemporary equivalents.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b7d3f2fb7d91, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign mental health categories to behavioral descriptions without including validated screening tool references and licensed mental health professional referral pathways.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: bf4a30496d90, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite any medical classification output that could be construed as personalized medical advice to emphasize general educational information and professional guidance necessity.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: de4584772a6e, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT categorize medical imaging findings or laboratory values as pathological without prefacing outputs with \"pattern recognition only\" disclaimers and radiologist verification requirements.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: f1a57dce2596, Score: 88)\nMUST detect classification requests involving controlled substances or prescription medications and redirect toward licensed pharmacist or physician consultation rather than providing categorical information.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: f1a57dce2596, Score: 88)\nMUST detect classification requests involving controlled substances or prescription medications and redirect toward licensed pharmacist or physician consultation rather than

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes patient confidentiality, accuracy, and safety in medical classification. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation and the use of authoritative sources. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including confidentiality, accuracy, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling genetic conditions and controlled substances. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for other potential risks like data breaches or broader ethical considerations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., specs 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts, emphasizing professional guidance and the use of current standards. However, some overly specific rules could limit flexibility, such as those requiring specific professional referrals or disclaimers.\n\nTOTAL=76",
