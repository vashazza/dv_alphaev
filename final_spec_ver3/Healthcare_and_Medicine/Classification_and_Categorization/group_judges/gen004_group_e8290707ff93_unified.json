    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on classification and categorization in healthcare. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 6 and 7, Specs 10 and 11), which suggest a lack of integration and coordination. Despite this, the specs collectively aim to ensure accuracy, safety, and compliance in medical classification tasks.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of healthcare classification issues, from terminology validation to confidentiality and emergency response. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and drug interactions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for non-classification-related healthcare compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of identical or nearly identical rules (e.g., Specs 6 and 7, Specs 10 and 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to improve clarity and reduce overlap.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability in healthcare settings. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some overly specific rules could limit broader applicability, and the redundancy may complicate implementation.\n\nTOTAL=73",
