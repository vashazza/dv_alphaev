    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They emphasize the importance of context, verification, and specialist input, which are consistent themes across the group. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare and medical classification scenarios, including pain assessment, drug interactions, medical imaging, mental health, emergencies, and more. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more foundational rules to cover broader scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15, SPEC 10 and SPEC 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing verification and specialist input. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse contexts."
