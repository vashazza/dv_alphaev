    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of healthcare classification and categorization, such as emergency situations, drug interactions, and reproductive health. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on disclaimers and professional guidance. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including emergency situations, drug safety, and reproductive health. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as the inclusion of disclaimers and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on chronic disease management or mental health beyond psychiatric classifications.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15, SPEC 1 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on providing disclaimers and professional guidance. They balance security with usability by including probabilistic language and emphasizing the need for professional consultation. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts, such as those requiring comprehensive pharmaceutical history dialogue."
