    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of healthcare classification, such as emergency situations, drug interactions, and terminology validation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15, SPEC 1 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including emergency situations, drug safety, and reproductive health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as the inclusion of disclaimers and emergency contact information. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for non-emergency chronic conditions or mental health support beyond crisis intervention.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15, SPEC 1 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and compliance. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for different scenarios, such as emergency situations and drug interactions. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
