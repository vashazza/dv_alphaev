    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare classification tasks. However, there are some repeated specs that do not add new dimensions to the policy, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a range of important areas, including emergency situations, psychiatric assessments, and pharmaceutical safety. However, the focus is heavily on specific scenarios without enough broad foundational rules, leaving potential gaps in general healthcare compliance.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, with multiple identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 13, 14, 18, 19) that could be consolidated. This repetition does not contribute to robustness and instead indicates inefficiency in the policy set.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on critical safety areas. However, the repetition of specific rules and lack of broader applicability in some cases may hinder adaptability and implementation across diverse healthcare contexts."
