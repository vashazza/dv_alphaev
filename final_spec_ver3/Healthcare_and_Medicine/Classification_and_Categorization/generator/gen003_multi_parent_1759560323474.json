Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They emphasize the importance of context, verification, and specialist input, which are consistent themes across the group. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare and medical classification scenarios, including pain assessment, drug interactions, medical imaging, mental health, emergencies, and more. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more foundational rules to cover broader scenarios..

They emphasize the importance of context, verification, and specialist input, which are consistent themes across the group. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare and medical classification scenarios, including pain assessment, drug interactions, medical imaging, mental health, emergencies, and more. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more foundational rules to cover broader scenarios.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15, SPEC 10 and SPEC 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing verification and specialist input. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST cross-reference surgical procedure classifications against current CPT codes and include inform...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST NOT assign surgical procedure classifications without verifying against current medical coding ...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST NOT attempt classification of medical imaging descriptions or laboratory value ranges without s...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
