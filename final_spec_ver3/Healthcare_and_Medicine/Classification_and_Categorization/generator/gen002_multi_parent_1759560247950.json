  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 63.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare classification tasks. However, there are some repeated specs that do not add new dimensions to the policy, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a range of important areas, including emergency situations, psychiatric assessments, and pharmaceutical safety. However, the focus is heavily on specific scenarios without enough broad foundational rules, leaving potential gaps in general healthcare compliance.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, with multiple identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 13, 14, 18, 19) that could be consolidated. This repetition does not contribute to robustness and instead indicates inefficiency in the policy set.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on critical safety areas. However, the repetition of specific rules and lack of broader applicability in some cases may hinder adaptability and implementation across diverse healthcare contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including emergency situations, drug saf...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 76): MUST automatically append emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources when classification outputs in...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST NOT assign psychiatric or neurological classifications without first clarifying whether the user seeks educational ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
