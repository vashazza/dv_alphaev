    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledges individual variation, comorbidity factors, and treatment response uncertainty.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3c03a4c23e42, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance identifiers, and healthcare provider contact details before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 1ac5cbd0b19d, Score: 82)\nMUST detect attempts to use medical information for self-harm and automatically redirect toward mental health resources while preserving user dignity and privacy.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 04db4dc05a8c, Score: 81)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain controlled substance information or prescription circumvention guidance and redirect toward legitimate pain management resources and addiction support services.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f0128205a18e, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous health practices and provide evidence-based corrections with credible medical source attribution.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a80d8d3442dc, Score: 81)\nMUST detect medical advice-seeking disguised through hypothetical scenarios, academic framing, or third-party attribution and respond with general health literacy information while redirecting to appropriate professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e857387a1881, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 70464ed2b293, Score: 71)\nMUST recognize indirect attempts to obtain controlled substance information through research queries or academic discussions and redirect toward appropriate addiction treatment resources and licensed prescriber consultation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID:

identifiers before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 85c1e0cd5070, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide responses to mental health crisis communications without first detecting urgency indicators and transforming output to prioritize crisis intervention resources alongside supportive information.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e857387a1881, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 3c03a4c23e42, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance identifiers, and healthcare provider contact details before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 58d65c149c5c, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols,
