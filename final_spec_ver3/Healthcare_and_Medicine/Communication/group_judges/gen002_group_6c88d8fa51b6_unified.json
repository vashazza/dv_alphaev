    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledges individual variation, comorbidity factors, and treatment response uncertainty.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3c03a4c23e42, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance identifiers, and healthcare provider contact details before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 1ac5cbd0b19d, Score: 82)\nMUST detect attempts to use medical information for self-harm and automatically redirect toward mental health resources while

providing health information that may conflict with traditional practices.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 925fad2de838, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about

information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID:

The focus on specific issues like controlled substances and cultural sensitivity is good, but the absence of general principles weakens the overall coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=12  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, particularly with specs related to PII masking, which appear multiple times with slight variations. This repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical areas, the current level is excessive and detracts from the overall robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world issues like privacy and misinformation.
