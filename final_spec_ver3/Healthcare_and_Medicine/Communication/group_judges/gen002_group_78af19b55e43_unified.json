    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are discussed, flagging any potential contraindications prominently.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID:

mental health treatment options and provide location-appropriate resource guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a80d8d3442dc, Score: 81)\nMUST detect medical advice-seeking disguised through hypothetical scenarios, academic framing, or third-party attribution and respond with general health literacy information while redirecting to appropriate professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 2dd81c02d4cb,

specialist consultation needs.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e857387a1881, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 1ac5cbd0b19d, Score: 82)\nMUST detect attempts to use medical information for self-harm and automatically redirect toward mental health resources while preserving user dignity and privacy.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 85c1e0cd5070, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide responses to mental health crisis communications without first detecting urgency indicators and transforming output to prioritize crisis intervention resources alongside supportive information.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID:

health practices and provide evidence-based corrections with credible medical source attribution.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 56502f50d1a3, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care resources and advance directive guidance while maintaining compassionate communication tone.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 925fad2de838, Score:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The policy group demonstrates some level of cohesion, with several specifications focusing on misinformation, privacy, and sensitive topics. However, there are multiple instances of identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 1, 3, 10, 11) and similar themes (e.g., SPEC 7 and 16), which suggest a lack of integration and coordination. The specs do not fully form a coherent strategy, as they seem to be more a collection of individual rules rather than a unified framework.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of topics relevant to healthcare communication, including misinformation, privacy, mental health, and cultural sensitivity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as jurisdiction-sensitive topics and end-of-life care. However, there are gaps in addressing other critical areas like data security beyond PII masking and comprehensive patient education strategies.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=10  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple identical or nearly identical entries (e.g., SPEC 1, 3, 10, 11 and SPEC 13, 14, 15). This suggests inefficiency and a lack of consolidation. While some redundancy is necessary for critical areas, the repetition here does not add robustness and instead indicates a need for streamlining.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like misinformation correction and privacy protection. However, the presence of overly specific rules and repeated specifications reduces their overall practicality. The rules are somewhat adaptable but could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable guidelines to enhance usability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=63",
