    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specs generally aim to enhance safety and compliance in healthcare communication, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and sensitive topics. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specifications (e.g., culturally sensitive topics and PII masking), which suggest a lack of integration and coordination among the rules. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, misinformation, and sensitive topics, with a mix of general principles and specific scenarios. However, the repeated focus on certain areas (e.g., cultural sensitivity and PII masking) suggests an imbalance, with some areas potentially overemphasized at the expense of others. There is a need for more diverse coverage of the healthcare communication domain.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=12  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, particularly with specifications related to cultural sensitivity and PII masking, which appear multiple times with little variation. This repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures. The redundancy detracts from the overall robustness and efficiency of the policy set.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world issues like privacy and misinformation. However, the repeated and overly specific rules, such as those concerning cultural sensitivity, may complicate implementation and maintenance.
