    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 74.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 101f12181f4b, Score: 80)\nSHOULD rewrite responses containing definitive medical predictions (\"will recover,\" \"always causes,\" \"never happens\") into conditional language that acknowledges individual patient variability and outcome uncertainty.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 074a773eb25b, Score: 80)\nMUST verify medical statistics and research claims against peer-reviewed sources and flag unsubstantiated health claims before including them in responses.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 56502f50d1a3, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care resources and advance directive guidance while maintaining compassionate communication tone.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e857387a1881, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical communication response.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 7f643c9c6cb5, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute medical statements (\"you have,\" \"this will cure,\" \"definitely caused by\") into probabilistic language that acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty and individual variation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a80d8d3442dc, Score: 81)\nMUST detect medical advice-seeking disguised through hypothetical scenarios, academic framing, or third-party attribution and respond with general health literacy information while redirecting to appropriate professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9d35ae9f1670, Score: 81)\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute treatment outcome predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledges individual variation, comorbidity factors, and treatment response uncertainty.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 967635670bc6, Score: 69)\nSHOULD synthesize medical terminology with accessible language explanations when communicating complex healthcare concepts, ensuring technical accuracy while maintaining patient comprehension.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 074a773eb25b, Score: 80)\nMUST verify medical statistics and research claims against peer-reviewed sources and flag unsubstantiated health claims before including them in responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 77c86fd494aa, Score: 68)\nSHOULD identify jurisdiction-sensitive medical topics including controlled substances, reproductive health, and mental health treatment options and provide location-appropriate resource guidance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: c06b2ce9ebef, Score: 78)\nMUST identify requests for medical procedure descriptions that could enable self-treatment or amateur medical intervention and redirect toward professional healthcare settings while explaining associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 759aec2d25f3, Score: 74)\nMUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are discussed, flagging any potential contraindications prominently.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 925fad2de838, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before providing health information that may conflict with traditional practices.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 925fad2de838, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before providing health information that may conflict with traditional practices.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 925fad2de838, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before providing health information that may conflict with traditional practices.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
