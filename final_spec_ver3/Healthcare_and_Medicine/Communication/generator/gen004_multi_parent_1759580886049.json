  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 65.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally aim to enhance safety and compliance in healthcare communication, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and sensitive topics. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specifications (e.g., culturally sensitive topics and PII masking), which suggest a lack of integration and coordination among the rules. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, misinformation, and sensitive topics, with a mix of general principles and specific scenarios. However, the repeated focus on certain areas (e.g., cultural sensitivity and PII masking) suggests an imbalance, with some areas potentially overemphasized at the expense of others. There is a need for more diverse coverage of the healthcare communication domain.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, particularly with specifications related to cultural sensitivity and PII masking, which appear multiple times with little variation. This repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures. The redundancy detracts from the overall robustness and efficiency of the policy set.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world issues like privacy and misinformation. However, the repeated and overly specific rules, such as those concerning cultural sensitivity, may complicate implementation and maintenance. More flexible and broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including privacy, mis...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST rewrite any response containing absolute treatment outcome predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledge...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for healthcare ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including privacy, mis...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST rewrite any response containing absolute treatment outcome predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledge...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including privacy, acc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): SHOULD rewrite responses containing definitive medical predictions (\"will recover,\" \"always causes,\" \"never happens\") in...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 65/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on misinformation, pr...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication risks, including misinformation, privacy,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 63/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on ensuring accurate...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers important areas such as privacy, accuracy, and the need for professional consultati...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): SHOULD rewrite responses containing definitive medical predictions (\"will recover,\" \"always causes,\" \"never happens\") in...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 63/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The policy group demonstrates some level of cohesion, with several specifications focusing on misinf...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of topics relevant to healthcare communication, including misinformat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specs generally aim to enhance safety and compliance in healthcare communication, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and sensitive topics.
