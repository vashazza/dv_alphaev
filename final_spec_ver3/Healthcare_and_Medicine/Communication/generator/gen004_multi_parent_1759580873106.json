  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 67.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and sensitive communication in healthcare. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specs (e.g., PII masking), which could be consolidated to enhance cohesion. The specs addressing cultural sensitivity and misinformation complement each other but could be better integrated into a unified strategy.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important areas, including privacy, misinformation, and mental health. However, there is a lack of foundational rules that could tie these specific areas together. The focus on specific issues like controlled substances and cultural sensitivity is good, but the absence of general principles weakens the overall coverage.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, particularly with specs related to PII masking, which appear multiple times with slight variations. This repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical areas, the current level is excessive and detracts from the overall robustness.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world issues like privacy and misinformation. However, the repetition of certain specs and the specificity of others (e.g., cultural sensitivity) may complicate implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including privacy, mis...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST rewrite any response containing absolute treatment outcome predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledge...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for healthcare ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including privacy, mis...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST rewrite any response containing absolute treatment outcome predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledge...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including privacy, acc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): SHOULD rewrite responses containing definitive medical predictions (\"will recover,\" \"always causes,\" \"never happens\") in...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 65/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on misinformation, pr...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication risks, including misinformation, privacy,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 63/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on ensuring accurate...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers important areas such as privacy, accuracy, and the need for professional consultati...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): SHOULD rewrite responses containing definitive medical predictions (\"will recover,\" \"always causes,\" \"never happens\") in...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 63/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The policy group demonstrates some level of cohesion, with several specifications focusing on misinf...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of topics relevant to healthcare communication, including misinformat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and sensitive communication in healthcare.
