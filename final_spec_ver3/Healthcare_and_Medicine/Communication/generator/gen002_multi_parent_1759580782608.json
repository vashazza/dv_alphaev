  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 65.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on misinformation, privacy, and sensitive topics. However, there are multiple instances of identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 3, 10, 11) and similar themes (e.g., culturally sensitive topics in SPEC 13, 14, 15) that suggest a lack of integration and coordination. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or redundancies that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication risks, including misinformation, privacy, drug interactions, and mental health crises. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as jurisdiction-sensitive topics and culturally sensitive health issues. However, the repetition of certain specs suggests a missed opportunity to address other critical areas, such as data security beyond PII masking or broader public health communication strategies.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, with multiple identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 3, 10, 11) and similar specs (e.g., SPEC 13, 14, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these specs could enhance clarity and reduce unnecessary duplication without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like misinformation correction and privacy protection. However, the repetition of certain specs and overly specific rules (e.g., jurisdiction-sensitive topics) could hinder adaptability and implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would improve practicality and usability across diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses misinform...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication risks, including misinformation, drug int...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): SHOULD rewrite responses containing definitive medical predictions (\"will recover,\" \"always causes,\" \"never happens\") in...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
