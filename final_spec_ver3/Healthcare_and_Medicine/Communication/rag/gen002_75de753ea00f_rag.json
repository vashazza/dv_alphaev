    "cohesion": "The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on misinformation, privacy, and sensitive topics. However, there are multiple instances of identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 3, 10, 11) and similar themes (e.g., culturally sensitive topics in SPEC 13, 14, 15) that suggest a lack of integration and coordination. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or redundancies that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication risks, including misinformation, privacy, drug interactions, and mental health crises. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as jurisdiction-sensitive topics and culturally sensitive health issues. However, the repetition of certain specs suggests a missed opportunity to address other critical areas, such as data security beyond PII masking or broader public health communication strategies.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, with multiple identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 3, 10, 11) and similar specs (e.g., SPEC 13, 14, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these specs could enhance clarity and reduce unnecessary duplication without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like misinformation correction and privacy protection. However, the repetition of certain specs and overly specific rules (e.g., jurisdiction-sensitive topics) could hinder adaptability and implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would improve practicality and usability across diverse contexts."
