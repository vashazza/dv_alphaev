    "cohesion": "The specs generally aim to enhance safety and compliance in healthcare communication, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and sensitive topics. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specifications (e.g., culturally sensitive topics and PII masking), which suggest a lack of integration and coordination among the rules. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, misinformation, and sensitive topics, with a mix of general principles and specific scenarios. However, the repeated focus on certain areas (e.g., cultural sensitivity and PII masking) suggests an imbalance, with some areas potentially overemphasized at the expense of others. There is a need for more diverse coverage of the healthcare communication domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, particularly with specifications related to cultural sensitivity and PII masking, which appear multiple times with little variation. This repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures. The redundancy detracts from the overall robustness and efficiency of the policy set.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world issues like privacy and misinformation. However, the repeated and overly specific rules, such as those concerning cultural sensitivity, may complicate implementation and maintenance. More flexible and broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability across different contexts."
