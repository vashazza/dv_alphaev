    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, focusing on privacy, misinformation, and sensitive communication in healthcare. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specs (e.g., PII masking), which could be consolidated to enhance cohesion. The specs addressing cultural sensitivity and misinformation complement each other but could be better integrated into a unified strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of important areas, including privacy, misinformation, and mental health. However, there is a lack of foundational rules that could tie these specific areas together. The focus on specific issues like controlled substances and cultural sensitivity is good, but the absence of general principles weakens the overall coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, particularly with specs related to PII masking, which appear multiple times with slight variations. This repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical areas, the current level is excessive and detracts from the overall robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world issues like privacy and misinformation. However, the repetition of certain specs and the specificity of others (e.g., cultural sensitivity) may complicate implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability."
