    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on consent, educational purpose, and redirecting inappropriate requests. However, there is some redundancy, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including patient privacy, consent, and the prevention of misuse. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling requests involving vulnerable populations and redirecting inappropriate content. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., audit trails and anatomical imagery involving minors). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in broader scenarios."
