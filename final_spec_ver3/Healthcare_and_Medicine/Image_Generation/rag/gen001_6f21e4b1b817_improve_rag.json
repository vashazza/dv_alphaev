    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of medical image generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as ensuring accuracy, confidentiality, and compliance with legal standards. However, there is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specs, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including legal compliance, privacy, accuracy, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling vulnerable populations and emergency scenarios. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging technologies or cross-border compliance issues.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 3 and 11, Specs 8 and 18, Specs 7 and 19). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as educational and clinical settings. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly impacting practicality."
