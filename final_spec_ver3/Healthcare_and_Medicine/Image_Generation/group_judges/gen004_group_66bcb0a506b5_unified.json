    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identities from any text prompts before visual content generation.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 037679e52aa4, Score: 68)\nSHOULD identify gaps between requested medical imagery and current evidence-based knowledge, explicitly noting limitations and recommending expert consultation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: cef51c072a4f, Score: 80)\nMUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy by cross-referencing medical terminology against established anatomical atlases before generating educational healthcare imagery.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 029aa648d7a6,

interpreted as personalized medical advice without explicit educational disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 49c0c59e7e73, Score: 66)\nMUST recognize when medical device imagery could enable misuse or counterfeiting and generate simplified educational representations that preserve learning value without technical specifications.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3ece41570cb2, Score: 73)\nMUST engage in confirmatory dialogue when medical image requests involve pediatric, geriatric, or vulnerable population contexts, ensuring appropriate sensitivity and professional oversight considerations are addressed.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 22f0e2b04ce0, Score: 81)\nSHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer guidance toward legitimate institutional channels instead of generating visual mockups.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3cb22012d9e2, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate images of prescription drug labels, dosage instructions, or medication

accuracy by cross-referencing multiple authoritative medical sources before visual generation.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: f94cf0fc0d2f, Score: 81)\nSHOULD detect requests for medical emergency scenarios and pause generation to ask clarifying questions about intended use, simultaneously providing appropriate emergency contact information and professional consultation reminders.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: f890c2ec9993, Score: 68)\nSHOULD request additional context when healthcare-related visual prompts lack sufficient specificity, asking targeted questions about intended audience, educational level,

identifiers, and facility-specific codes when generating anatomical reference materials or clinical workflow diagrams.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 029aa648d7a6, Score: 69)\nMUST detect and neutralize prompt
