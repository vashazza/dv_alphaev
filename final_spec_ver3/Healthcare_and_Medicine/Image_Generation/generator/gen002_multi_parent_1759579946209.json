Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as ensuring consent and educational purpose, and redirecting inappropriate requests. However, there are some redundancies, such as duplicate specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including consent, sensitive populations, and misleading imagery. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as redirecting requests for self-harm or drug interactions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for non-medical contexts or broader ethical considerations..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as ensuring consent and educational purpose, and redirecting inappropriate requests. However, there are some redundancies, such as duplicate specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including consent, sensitive populations, and misleading imagery. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as redirecting requests for self-harm or drug interactions. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for non-medical contexts or broader ethical considerations.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 9). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as redirecting inappropriate requests and maintaining audit trails. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) MUST maintain audit trails for medical image generation to enable clinical oversight and compliance ...\n  - [2] (Score: 66) MUST recognize when medical device imagery could enable misuse or counterfeiting and generate simpli...\n  - [3] (Score: 73) MUST engage in confirmatory dialogue when medical image requests involve pediatric, geriatric, or vu...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
