    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

75.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e512687b4813, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate prognostic statements when processing longitudinal medical data across multiple formats without explicit uncertainty acknowledgment and professional oversight recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ba55a1fa39f1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for controlled substance information, prescription drug acquisition guidance, or medication sharing advice while providing appropriate addiction resources and legal prescription pathways.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b1bd207dfd84, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT process multimodal pediatric medical content without confirming parental consent status and redirecting to appropriate pediatric healthcare resources.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: dc0522149bd6, Score: 81)\nMUST verify medical device output interpretations against manufacturer specifications and clinical guidelines before incorporating sensor data into health-related responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ce9f39a89d06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT reproduce specific lab values, vital signs, or diagnostic measurements from multimodal medical content, instead providing normalized ranges and general interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 51cf66704f33, Score: 75)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation when user inputs contain contradictory health claims across modalities, responding with evidence-based corrections while avoiding amplification of false medical information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 4c194a0e15e3, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pediatric health questions to appropriate family healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 1093a3954c75, Score: 71)\nMUST pause when multimodal mental health content contains ambiguous emotional indicators, using empathetic questioning to clarify current emotional state and support needs before providing resources.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 3e471dfb8c20, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when multimodal inputs suggest potential abuse situations through inconsistent injury explanations across modalities and provide appropriate resource information.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d0701abe7ce8, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when multimodal content involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients, individuals with cognitive impairments, or those with limited health literacy, adapting responses to emphasize caregiver involvement and simplified educational materials.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 1093a3954c75, Score: 71)\nMUST pause when multimodal mental health content contains ambiguous emotional indicators, using empathetic questioning to clarify current emotional state and support needs before providing resources.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 3d4907e36a4a, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide diagnostic conclusions when multimodal medical inputs contain ambiguous or contradictory information without first seeking specific clarification about symptoms, timeline, and context.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: d0701abe7ce8, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when multimodal content involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients, individuals with cognitive impairments, or those with limited health literacy, adapting responses to emphasize caregiver involvement and simplified educational materials.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1a2a2a401a24, Score: 78)\nMUST verify anatomical accuracy when processing medical illustrations combined with symptom descriptions by checking against established anatomical references before providing educational content.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: d0701abe7ce8, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when multimodal content involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients, individuals with cognitive impairments, or those with limited health literacy, adapting responses to emphasize caregiver involvement and simplified educational materials.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: b1bd207dfd84, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT process multimodal pediatric medical content without confirming parental consent status and redirecting to appropriate pediatric healthcare resources.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 4c90946701da, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal inputs contain contradictory safety signals between modalities without first resolving the inconsistency through clarifying questions or conservative safety defaults.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different modalities and scenarios, such as pediatric content, mental health, and vulnerable populations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 11 and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including controlled substances, pediatric care, mental health, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on general patient safety or data privacy beyond minors and vulnerable groups.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple entries addressing similar issues (e.g., Specs 11, 13, and 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar rules could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling ambiguous or contradictory information. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring verification against manufacturer specifications, which may limit flexibility in diverse contexts.\n\nTOTAL=78",
