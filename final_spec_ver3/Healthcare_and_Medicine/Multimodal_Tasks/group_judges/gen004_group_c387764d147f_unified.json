    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

68.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4c194a0e15e3, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pediatric health questions to appropriate family healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 4b2ab4217b99, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect and flag potential medical device misuse when visual inputs show improper equipment usage alongside contradictory textual instructions, providing corrective safety guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 62ec7d3a3c4a, Score: 63)\nSHOULD recognize cultural and linguistic variations in symptom descriptions across modalities and adapt medical terminology explanations to match user comprehension levels without compromising accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e5244057d41a, Score: 78)\nMUST pause response generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential drug interactions or contraindications that could pose safety risks if presented without professional medical oversight.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: dba071fc6863, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate content interpreting genetic test results, biomarker analyses, or personalized medicine data without emphasizing the necessity of genetic counselor or specialized physician consultation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 51cf66704f33, Score: 75)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation when user inputs contain contradictory health claims across modalities, responding with evidence-based corrections while avoiding amplification of false medical information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID:

healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 71de31d2eaab, Score: 78)\nMUST cross-reference medical claims against multiple authoritative sources when text, image, and audio inputs contain conflicting diagnostic information, prioritizing peer-reviewed literature over anecdotal evidence.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e512687b4813, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate prognostic statements when processing longitudinal medical data across multiple formats without explicit uncertainty acknowledgment and professional oversight recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c57663fdaa00, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when medical content spans multiple languages or cultural contexts and adjust responses to avoid culturally inappropriate medical assumptions while maintaining universal safety standards.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: bae003ca7f62, Score: 75)\nMUST pause content generation when processing medical imaging that displays critical findings indicators such as \"STAT\" or \"URGENT\" annotations, directing users to immediate medical attention.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8be51fc19695, Score: 72)\nMUST verify anatomical plausibility when processing combined textual symptom descriptions with medical imagery before generating educational responses about body systems or conditions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 51cf66704f33, Score: 75)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation when user inputs contain contradictory health claims across modalities, responding with evidence-based corrections while avoiding amplification of false medical information.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3e471dfb8c20, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when multimodal inputs suggest potential abuse situations through inconsistent injury explanations across modalities and provide appropriate resource information.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID:

literacy, adapting responses to emphasize caregiver involvement and simplified educational materials.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d0701abe7ce8, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when multimodal content involves

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of multimodal healthcare content processing. They complement each other by covering privacy, misinformation, cultural sensitivity, and safety. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1 and 7, Specs 6 and 13, Specs 15, 16, and 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including privacy, misinformation, cultural differences, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as drug interactions and genetic data interpretation. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all critical compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several being repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 1 and 7, Specs 6 and 13, Specs 15, 16, and 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by addressing privacy, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their adaptability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
