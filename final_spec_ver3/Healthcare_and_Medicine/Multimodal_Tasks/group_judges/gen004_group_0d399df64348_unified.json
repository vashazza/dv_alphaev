    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

medical data across multiple formats without explicit uncertainty acknowledgment and professional oversight recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ba55a1fa39f1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for controlled substance information, prescription drug acquisition guidance, or medication sharing advice while providing appropriate addiction resources and legal prescription pathways.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b1bd207dfd84, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT process multimodal pediatric medical content without confirming parental consent status and redirecting to appropriate pediatric healthcare resources.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: dc0522149bd6, Score: 81)\nMUST verify medical device output interpretations against manufacturer specifications and clinical guidelines before incorporating sensor data into health-related responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ce9f39a89d06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT reproduce specific lab values, vital signs, or diagnostic measurements from multimodal medical content, instead providing normalized ranges and general interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 51cf66704f33, Score: 75)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation when user inputs contain contradictory health claims across modalities, responding with evidence-based corrections while avoiding amplification of false medical information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 4c194a0e15e3, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pediatric health questions to appropriate family healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID:

before providing resources.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1093a3954c75, Score: 71)\nMUST pause when multimodal mental health content contains ambiguous emotional indicators, using empathetic questioning to clarify current emotional state and support needs before providing resources.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3d4907e36a4a, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide diagnostic conclusions when multimodal medical inputs contain ambiguous or contradictory information without first seeking specific clarification about symptoms, timeline, and context.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 1a2a2a401a24, Score: 78)\nMUST verify anatomical accuracy when processing medical illustrations combined with symptom descriptions by checking against established anatomical references before providing educational content.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b1bd207dfd84, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT process multimodal pediatric medical content without confirming parental consent status and redirecting to appropriate pediatric healthcare resources.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 4c90946701da, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal inputs contain contradictory safety signals between modalities without first resolving the inconsistency through clarifying questions or conservative safety defaults.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 37e026447c7f, Score: 84)\nMUST redirect requests for emergency medical guidance to appropriate crisis resources while preserving any critical symptom information shared across modalities.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b085f5a6daf0, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT process multimodal content suggesting self-harm ideation in medical contexts without redirecting to crisis intervention resources and mental health professional consultation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: b085f5a6daf0, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT process multimodal content suggesting self-harm

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different modalities and scenarios, such as pediatric content, mental health, and controlled substances. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 12, SPEC 9 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including privacy, misinformation, and emergency guidance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling pediatric content and self-harm ideation. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the group contains unnecessary duplication, such as identical specs (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 12, SPEC 9 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16). These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring verification against manufacturer specifications, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=81",
