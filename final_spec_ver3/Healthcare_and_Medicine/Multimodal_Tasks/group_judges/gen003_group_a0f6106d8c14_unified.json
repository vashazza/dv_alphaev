    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of multimodal healthcare data processing. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., vulnerable populations) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The specs cover different areas like privacy, misinformation, and vulnerable populations, but the repetition detracts from a fully unified strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of issues relevant to healthcare and multimodal tasks, including privacy, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. However, the focus is somewhat skewed towards specific scenarios, such as vulnerable populations, without enough general principles to balance the specificity. There are also gaps in addressing other critical areas like data security and general compliance.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications regarding vulnerable populations. This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be streamlined to improve robustness without unnecessary duplication. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the current level is excessive.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, the repetition of certain specs and the specificity of others (e.g., emotional indicators in mental health content) may hinder practical implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=69",
