Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of multimodal healthcare content. They complement each other by covering privacy, misinformation, cultural sensitivity, and safety, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 12 and SPEC 16, SPEC 7 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, misinformation, cultural considerations, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling minors' data and self-harm ideation. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks..

They complement each other by covering privacy, misinformation, cultural sensitivity, and safety, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 12 and SPEC 16, SPEC 7 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, misinformation, cultural considerations, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling minors' data and self-harm ideation. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 12 and SPEC 16, SPEC 7 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications might be overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) SHOULD recognize cultural and linguistic variations in symptom descriptions across modalities and ad...\n  - [2] (Score: 66) SHOULD recognize cultural or linguistic barriers in multimodal medical communications and adapt resp...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST NOT provide diagnostic interpretations when processing medical imaging data combined with sympt...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
