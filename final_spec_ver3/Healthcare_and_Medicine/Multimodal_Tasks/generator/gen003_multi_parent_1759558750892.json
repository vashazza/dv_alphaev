  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 65.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of multimodal medical content handling. However, there are some overlaps and repeated specifications that slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The specs cover a range of issues from privacy to misinformation, but the repetition of certain specs suggests a lack of integration.. Coverage: The group covers a broad spectrum of the healthcare domain, including privacy, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. However, the repeated focus on specific areas like vulnerable populations without broader foundational rules indicates some gaps in coverage. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases could be improved.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications regarding vulnerable populations (Specs 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16). This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to improve the policy set's robustness without unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, the repetition of certain rules and the specificity of some requirements may hinder flexibility and adaptability in different contexts. The specs could benefit from more broadly applicable rules that cover multiple scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important areas in healthcare, including pediatric care, mental he...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate prognostic statements when processing longitudinal medical data across multiple formats without explic...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect and redirect requests for controlled substance information, prescription drug acquisition guidance, or medic...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including p...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pe...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect and flag potential medical device misuse when visual inputs show improper equipment usage alongside contra...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, misi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pe...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect and flag potential medical device misuse when visual inputs show improper equipment usage alongside contra...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
