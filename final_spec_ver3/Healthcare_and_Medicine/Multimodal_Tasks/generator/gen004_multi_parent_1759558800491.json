Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of multimodal healthcare content. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as privacy, misinformation, and emergency guidance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1 and 8, Specs 12 and 16, Specs 7 and 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, misinformation, cultural sensitivity, and emergency response. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as drug interactions and self-harm ideation. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks..

They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as privacy, misinformation, and emergency guidance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1 and 8, Specs 12 and 16, Specs 7 and 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, misinformation, cultural sensitivity, and emergency response. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as drug interactions and self-harm ideation. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential risks.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication in the specifications, with identical or very similar specs appearing multiple times (e.g., Specs 1 and 8, Specs 12 and 16, Specs 7 and 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are quite specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios. Overall, the policy set is implementable but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) SHOULD recognize cultural and linguistic variations in symptom descriptions across modalities and ad...\n  - [2] (Score: 66) SHOULD recognize cultural or linguistic barriers in multimodal medical communications and adapt resp...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST pause response generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential drug interactions or contrai...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
