  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different scenarios such as pediatric care, mental health crises, and privacy concerns. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 1) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including privacy, misinformation, and crisis intervention. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as psychiatric crises and pediatric care. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical areas like chronic disease management or general adult healthcare, which could enhance the coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can be adapted to various contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across different scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, misi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pe...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect and flag potential medical device misuse when visual inputs show improper equipment usage alongside contra...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
