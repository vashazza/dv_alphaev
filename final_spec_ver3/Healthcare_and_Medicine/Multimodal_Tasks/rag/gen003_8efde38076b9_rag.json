    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of multimodal medical content handling. However, there are some overlaps and repeated specifications that slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The specs cover a range of issues from privacy to misinformation, but the repetition of certain specs suggests a lack of integration.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad spectrum of the healthcare domain, including privacy, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. However, the repeated focus on specific areas like vulnerable populations without broader foundational rules indicates some gaps in coverage. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases could be improved.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications regarding vulnerable populations (Specs 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16). This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to improve the policy set's robustness without unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, the repetition of certain rules and the specificity of some requirements may hinder flexibility and adaptability in different contexts. The specs could benefit from more broadly applicable rules that cover multiple scenarios."
