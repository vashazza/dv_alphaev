    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare and medicine, such as privacy, misinformation, and crisis management, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 1) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, misinformation, crisis management, and pediatric care. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on general medical ethics or data security beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are nearly identical (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring immediate redirection to pediatric resources, which may not always be feasible. More flexible rules could enhance adaptability across different contexts."
