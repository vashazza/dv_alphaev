    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on verifying information and protecting vulnerable populations. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of issues, including privacy, misinformation, and vulnerable populations, with a mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine, which are critical in modern healthcare.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 11 and 13 are repeated). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring verification against manufacturer specifications, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios."
