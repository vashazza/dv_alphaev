    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different areas such as drug interactions, mental health, and emergency situations. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly with repeated specs, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, mental health, and emergency response. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are some gaps in areas like chronic disease management and preventive care. The focus is more on acute and immediate risks rather than long-term health strategies.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 15 and SPEC 2, SPEC 16 and SPEC 9, SPEC 17 and SPEC 8, SPEC 18 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by requiring credential validation and database checks. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse healthcare contexts."
