    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare content generation. They complement each other by covering misinformation, accuracy, safety, and privacy. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare content generation, including misinformation, drug verification, safety for vulnerable populations, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and digital health trends.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 6, SPEC 5 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, though some rules are quite specific and could be more flexible to adapt to various contexts. Overall, they are implementable but could benefit from more general applicability."
