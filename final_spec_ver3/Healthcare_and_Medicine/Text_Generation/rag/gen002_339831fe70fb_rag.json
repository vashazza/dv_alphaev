    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as drug information, mental health, and patient confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like self-harm and emergency redirection, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, mental health, and patient confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as vulnerable populations and emergency situations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as self-harm and emergency redirection, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication, particularly in prompt injection detection (Specs 16 and 18). Consolidating these could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as various healthcare scenarios and user roles. However, some rules are overly specific, like those concerning genetic conditions, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts."
