    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare content generation. They complement each other by covering misinformation, accuracy, safety, and privacy. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in healthcare content generation, including misinformation, drug interactions, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling vulnerable populations and emergency scenarios. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging medical technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 8), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain specs suggests room for optimization.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring credential validation for dosage calculations, which may be challenging to implement consistently."
