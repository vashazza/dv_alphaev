    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as drug information, mental health, and emergency situations. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like self-harm and emergency redirection, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses critical areas such as drug interactions, mental health, and patient confidentiality. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as self-harm and emergency redirection, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication, particularly in prompt injection detection (Specs 16 and 18). Consolidating these could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to credential validation for healthcare professionals, which could be simplified for broader applicability."
