  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different areas such as drug information, mental health, and patient confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps, such as multiple specs addressing self-harm and emergency situations, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, mental health, and patient confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as vulnerable populations and genetic conditions. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging healthcare technologies and digital health trends to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly concerning self-harm and emergency response, which are addressed in multiple specs. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the overlap here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring credential validation for healthcare professionals, which may be challenging to implement consistently. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in healthcare content generation, including misi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD identify potentially harmful health misinformation patterns in user inputs and generate corrective educational co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST transform any generated content containing medical terminology into layered explanations that include both technica...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
