  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different areas such as drug information, mental health, and patient confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like self-harm and emergency redirection, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses critical areas like drug interactions, mental health crises, and patient confidentiality. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly in the handling of self-harm and emergency situations, which appear in multiple specs. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring credential validation, which may be challenging to implement consistently across different systems..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare content generation, inclu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD identify potentially harmful health misinformation patterns in user inputs and generate corrective educational co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST transform any generated content containing medical terminology into layered explanations that include both technica...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, m...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general prin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare content generation, inclu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD identify potentially harmful health misinformation patterns in user inputs and generate corrective educational co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST transform any generated content containing medical terminology into layered explanations that include both technica...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, m...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general prin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine.
