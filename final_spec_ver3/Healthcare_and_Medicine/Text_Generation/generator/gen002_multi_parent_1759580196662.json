  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as drug information, mental health, and patient confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like self-harm and emergency redirection, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, mental health, and patient confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as vulnerable populations and emergency situations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance the coverage.. Redundancy: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as self-harm and emergency redirection, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication, particularly in prompt injection detection (Specs 16 and 18). Consolidating these could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as various healthcare scenarios and user roles. However, some rules are overly specific, like those concerning genetic conditions, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, m...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general prin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in healthcare content generation, including misi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD identify potentially harmful health misinformation patterns in user inputs and generate corrective educational co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST transform any generated content containing medical terminology into layered explanations that include both technica...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug safety, m...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general prin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate pharmaceutical compound synthesis pathways, chemical precursor information, or laboratory preparation ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request or...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in healthcare content generation, including misi...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD identify potentially harmful health misinformation patterns in user inputs and generate corrective educational co...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST transform any generated content containing medical terminology into layered explanations that include both technica...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of healthcare and medicine.
