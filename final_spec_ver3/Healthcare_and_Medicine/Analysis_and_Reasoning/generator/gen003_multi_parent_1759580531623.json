Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related LLM outputs. They collectively focus on ensuring that medical advice is not given without proper context and professional oversight, and they stress the importance of educational content and emergency referrals. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and privacy concerns. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as pregnancy and self-medication scenarios. However, there could be more emphasis on other specific areas like chronic disease management or pediatric care to enhance coverage..

They collectively focus on ensuring that medical advice is not given without proper context and professional oversight, and they stress the importance of educational content and emergency referrals. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and privacy concerns. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as pregnancy and self-medication scenarios. However, there could be more emphasis on other specific areas like chronic disease management or pediatric care to enhance coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There are notable redundancies, particularly with specifications related to mental health (SPEC 5 and SPEC 10) and the conversion of medical advice into educational content (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on redirecting to professional medical services and ensuring the credibility of information. They balance security with usability by focusing on educational content and privacy. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to mental health and emergency situations, which could limit adaptability across different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST NOT generate probabilistic disease risk assessments or statistical health outcome predictions t...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
