Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and professional oversight in healthcare contexts. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on educational content and professional consultation. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there could be more foundational rules to cover other critical compliance areas like data security and patient consent..

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on educational content and professional consultation. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there could be more foundational rules to cover other critical compliance areas like data security and patient consent.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with specifications related to mental health and the conversion of medical advice into educational content. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The rules are flexible and broadly applicable, making them adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in diverse scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 67) MUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format wi...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST rewrite responses that contain medical advice language by converting recommendations into educa...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST NOT generate probabilistic disease risk assessments or statistical health outcome predictions t...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
