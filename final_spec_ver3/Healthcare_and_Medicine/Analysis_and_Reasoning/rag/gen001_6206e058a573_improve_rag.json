    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and professional oversight in healthcare contexts. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on educational content and professional consultation. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there could be more foundational rules to cover other critical compliance areas like data security and patient consent.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with specifications related to mental health and the conversion of medical advice into educational content. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The rules are flexible and broadly applicable, making them adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in diverse scenarios."
