    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different scenarios such as vulnerable populations, infectious diseases, and data privacy. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including vulnerable populations, public health emergencies, data privacy, and drug interactions. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and genetic conditions. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risk areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 9, and 10; SPEC 11 and 13). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying medical scenarios and data privacy concerns. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts."
