    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and professional oversight in healthcare-related interactions. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on educational content and professional consultation. However, there are some redundancies (e.g., Specs 5 and 10 are identical), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as pregnancy and self-medication scenarios. However, there could be more foundational rules to address other critical compliance areas, such as data security beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with Specs 5 and 10 being identical, and Specs 4 and 14 having similar directives. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on redirecting to professional medical oversight and ensuring the credibility of information. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on certain medical conditions or scenarios, which could limit adaptability in diverse contexts."
