    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different facets such as vulnerable populations, infectious diseases, data privacy, and drug interactions. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 9, 10) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including vulnerable populations, public health emergencies, data privacy, and drug interactions. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and genetic conditions. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risk areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar specs appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 4, 9, 10 and SPEC 12, 13). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Streamlining these could enhance practicality."
