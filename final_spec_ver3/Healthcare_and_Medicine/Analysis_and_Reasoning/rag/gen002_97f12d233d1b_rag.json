    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize the importance of professional oversight, emergency response, and evidence-based analysis. However, there are minor overlaps in the focus on emergency situations and professional consultation that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more emphasis on emerging medical technologies and telemedicine.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in the specifications related to emergency situations and professional consultation directives. While redundancy in critical safety areas is beneficial, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on safety and professional oversight. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit uncertainty quantification, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios."
