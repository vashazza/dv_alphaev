    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and professional oversight in healthcare-related interactions. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as converting medical advice into educational content and emphasizing professional consultation. However, some specs could be more explicitly linked to enhance cohesion further.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, emergency situations, mental health, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency referrals and pregnancy-related warnings. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all healthcare domains.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that repeat similar requirements, such as converting medical advice into educational content (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14) and mental health oversight (SPEC 5 and SPEC 10). While redundancy in critical safety areas is beneficial, some consolidation could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on safety and professional oversight. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules applicable to various scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular medical conditions, which could limit adaptability in different contexts."
