    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 77.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 738366eff985, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficient clinical context, instead providing educational information about relevant diagnostic processes and urging professional medical evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b1867f1547b1, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis requests require live clinical consultation versus retrospective data analysis.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6c6e586f5e18, Score: 84)\nMUST verify drug interaction analyses against current pharmacological databases and append explicit warnings when medication combinations present contraindication risks or require dosage adjustments.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fb1ed78f5dd4, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format with clear professional consultation directives integrated throughout the analysis.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 33408488e3b6, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about mental health conditions, psychiatric medications, or psychological interventions without emphasizing the critical importance of qualified mental health professional oversight.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 8e9221e01555, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educational material that cannot substitute for professional medical examination.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 925a0dc874c7, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT analyze emergency medical situations without immediate referral to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: c4d73abdd6da, Score: 67)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in medical contexts distinguish between established pathophysiological mechanisms and speculative connections, marking uncertain links appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: dfc5c1cc53d0, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that symptom analysis responses include explicit uncertainty ranges and alternative diagnostic possibilities rather than presenting single definitive interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 33408488e3b6, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about mental health conditions, psychiatric medications, or psychological interventions without emphasizing the critical importance of qualified mental health professional oversight.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f4e9d0ae4553, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when healthcare information requests involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and incorporate appropriate warnings about the critical importance of specialized obstetric and gynecological care.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8faa72587e68, Score: 74)\nMUST verify the credibility and recency of medical sources referenced in analytical reasoning by cross-checking publication dates, journal impact factors, and peer review status before incorporating findings into responses.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: fcfdbd09942a, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT proceed with diagnostic reasoning without first establishing whether the inquiry concerns an active medical emergency, redirecting immediately to emergency services when time-sensitive conditions are suspected.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: fb1ed78f5dd4, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format with clear professional consultation directives integrated throughout the analysis.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 60c01c6d6ffc, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance details, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical analysis response.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: e47ccc6add37, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically identify potentially dangerous self-medication scenarios during clarification dialogue and redirect toward professional medical oversight before providing analytical content.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
