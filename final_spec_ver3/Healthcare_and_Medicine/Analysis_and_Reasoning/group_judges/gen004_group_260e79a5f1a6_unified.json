    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 74.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: c4d73abdd6da, Score: 67)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in medical contexts distinguish between established pathophysiological mechanisms and speculative connections, marking uncertain links appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: dd902c54097d, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT present preliminary research findings or preprint studies as established medical facts when conducting literature analysis, instead clearly labeling evidence quality and peer review status.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e47ccc6add37, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically identify potentially dangerous self-medication scenarios during clarification dialogue and redirect toward professional medical oversight before providing analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 33408488e3b6, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about mental health conditions, psychiatric medications, or psychological interventions without emphasizing the critical importance of qualified mental health professional oversight.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fb1ed78f5dd4, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format with clear professional consultation directives integrated throughout the analysis.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 738366eff985, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficient clinical context, instead providing educational information about relevant diagnostic processes and urging professional medical evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8e9221e01555, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educational material that cannot substitute for professional medical examination.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e225eb573e1c, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that analytical reasoning about drug interactions accounts for dosage dependencies, timing factors, and individual metabolic variations before presenting interaction conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 22017c141f61, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations without explicit uncertainty quantification and confidence intervals for each analytical component.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8eb878cd9fda, Score: 79)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation attempts and counter with evidence-based corrections citing authoritative medical organizations and recent peer-reviewed research.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 5c491dc5cd54, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical cost-benefit analysis to include healthcare access equity considerations and insurance coverage variability disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 5c491dc5cd54, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical cost-benefit analysis to include healthcare access equity considerations and insurance coverage variability disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 19458377211f, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect when analytical requests involve rare diseases, genetic conditions, or complex multi-system disorders and supplement responses with uncertainty quantification and referrals to specialized medical centers or genetic counselors.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety and professional oversight in medical contexts. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of medical information processing, such as distinguishing between established facts and speculative connections, and ensuring professional consultation. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including drug interactions, mental health, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and self-medication scenarios. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging medical technologies or telemedicine.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications related to vulnerable populations and medical cost-benefit analysis, which appear multiple times. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming medical advice into educational content and emphasizing professional oversight.
