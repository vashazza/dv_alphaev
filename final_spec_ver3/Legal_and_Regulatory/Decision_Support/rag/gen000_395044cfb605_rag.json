    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal decision support, such as unauthorized advice, regulatory currency, and confidentiality. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation and the use of probabilistic language. However, there is some redundancy, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including unauthorized legal advice, regulatory verification, PII protection, and conflict of interest detection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency legal situations and specialized bar admissions. There are no significant gaps in coverage, but the focus could be slightly more balanced between general and specific rules.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, such as the repetition of PII masking and case law citation verification. While redundancy can enhance robustness, in this case, it could be streamlined to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, but some consolidation would be beneficial.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The rules are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in different contexts. Overall, the policy set is implementable and maintainable in real-world scenarios."
