    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory decision support. They address various aspects of compliance, such as conflicts of interest, unauthorized legal advice, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 6), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including employment law, contract analysis, and environmental compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as HIPAA compliance and hazardous waste disposal. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of foundational rules for other critical areas like data privacy beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 6). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on interactive clarification and guided questioning. They balance security with usability by emphasizing professional consultation and ethical compliance. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed procedural safeguards for power imbalances, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios."
