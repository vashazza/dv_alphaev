    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as conflicts of interest, unauthorized legal advice, and ethical compliance. The specs complement each other by covering different scenarios and ensuring that decision support is provided responsibly. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including employment law, contract analysis, litigation strategy, and environmental compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as HIPAA compliance and hazardous waste disposal. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of focus on international regulatory frameworks or digital privacy laws, which are critical in today's globalized and digital landscape.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11, SPEC 12 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the redundancy slightly reduces the overall score.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on ensuring compliance and ethical decision-making. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and potential conflicts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like adversarial positioning language, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
