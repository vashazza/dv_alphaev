    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal decision support, such as unauthorized advice, regulatory currency, PII protection, and the need for professional consultation. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance. However, there is some redundancy, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including unauthorized advice, confidentiality, and jurisdictional variations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency legal situations and specialized bar admissions. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, such as the repetition of PII masking and case law citation verification. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. The presence of duplicate specifications slightly reduces the score.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed probabilistic language, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios."
