    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as jurisdictional issues, professional licensing, and confidentiality. There are logical connections between the requirements, and they collectively contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there is some repetition in the emphasis on rewriting responses with probabilistic language, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including jurisdictional complexities, professional licensing, confidentiality, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling domestic violence indicators and multi-state tax implications. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on emerging legal technologies and digital privacy concerns to enhance coverage further.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly in the repeated emphasis on rewriting responses with probabilistic language and acknowledging jurisdictional variations. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, such as professional licensing and confidentiality, some overlapping requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring verification dialogues for certain scenarios, which could be streamlined for better practicality."
