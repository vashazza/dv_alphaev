    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal and regulatory decision support. They address various aspects of compliance, such as conflicts of interest, unauthorized legal advice, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including employment law, contract analysis, and environmental compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are some gaps in areas like international regulations and digital privacy laws that could be addressed for more comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6, 11, and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed procedural safeguards for employment law matters, which may be challenging to implement across diverse scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
