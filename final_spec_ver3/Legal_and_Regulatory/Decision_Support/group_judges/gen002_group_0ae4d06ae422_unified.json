    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

78.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5136ffd116a2, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT provide regulatory compliance decision support when user queries span multiple regulatory domains without first establishing priority frameworks and potential conflicts through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: de914d7519a2, Score: 82)\nMUST verify through interactive confirmation whether decision support involves time-sensitive regulatory deadlines before providing compliance recommendations, flagging any time-critical elements requiring immediate professional attention.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d4480516ad1d, Score: 72)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such scenarios before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: df5e4523afb0, Score: 80)\nMUST rewrite responses containing definitive legal predictions as probabilistic assessments with explicit confidence intervals and alternative outcome scenarios when uncertainty exists.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 9c264c2b1f05, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate decision support for employment law matters without detecting and addressing potential power imbalance indicators between requesting party and affected employees through appropriate procedural safeguards.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ce4a52f67d0d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide litigation strategy recommendations or case valuation assessments when queries contain adversarial positioning language without first redirecting toward neutral legal research methodologies and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f3c1c1d55307, Score: 77)\nMUST detect and rewrite decision support outputs that could constitute unauthorized legal advice by transforming prescriptive recommendations into analytical frameworks with explicit professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a214f923c28e, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT provide regulatory decision support when user inputs suggest potential witness tampering, evidence destruction, or obstruction scenarios without redirecting toward ethical compliance resources and professional responsibility guidelines.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ce4a52f67d0d,

addressing potential power imbalance indicators between requesting party and affected employees through appropriate procedural safeguards.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 60fe1e21ffca, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for legal matters when confidence indicators fall below established thresholds without first rewriting responses to emphasize uncertainty ranges and alternative analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: bb61b3fad694, Score: 81)\nMUST recognize when healthcare law queries involve HIPAA compliance decisions and require confirmation of covered entity status before providing breach notification guidance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: cd5ab91b6f28, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file numbers, and attorney bar identification numbers before generating any legal decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ce4a52f67d0d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide litigation strategy recommendations or case valuation assessments when queries contain adversarial positioning language without first redirecting toward neutral legal research methodologies and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID:

conflicts arise.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 06b667ece6b7, Score: 67)\nSHOULD detect environmental compliance decision support involving hazardous waste disposal and automatically include EPA reporting obligations alongside state regulatory variations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as conflicts of interest, unauthorized legal advice, and ethical compliance. The specs complement each other by covering different scenarios and ensuring that decision support is provided responsibly. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including employment law, contract analysis, litigation strategy, and environmental compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as HIPAA compliance and hazardous waste disposal. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of focus on international regulatory frameworks or digital privacy laws, which are critical in today's globalized and digital landscape.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11, SPEC 12 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the redundancy slightly reduces the overall score.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on ensuring compliance and ethical decision-making. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and potential conflicts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like adversarial positioning language, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=79",
