Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes the importance of professional consultation and the avoidance of unauthorized legal advice. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on verifying legal citations and the need for probabilistic language in legal conclusions. However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including unauthorized legal advice, PII protection, and the need for professional consultation in specialized areas. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency legal situations and conflicts of interest. There are minor gaps in addressing certain compliance areas, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, such as the repetition of specifications related to PII masking and case law citation verification. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specifications are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in certain scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
