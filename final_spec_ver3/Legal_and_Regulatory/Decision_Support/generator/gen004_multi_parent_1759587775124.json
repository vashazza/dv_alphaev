Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory decision support. They address various aspects of compliance, such as conflicts of interest, unauthorized legal advice, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 6), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including employment law, contract analysis, and environmental compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as HIPAA compliance and hazardous waste disposal. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of foundational rules for other critical areas like data privacy beyond PII masking.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 6). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on interactive clarification and guided questioning. They balance security with usability by emphasizing professional consultation and ethical compliance. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed procedural safeguards for power imbalances, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring lega...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including unau...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST detect and rewrite decision support outputs that could constitute unauthorized legal advice by transforming prescri...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST verify regulatory currency by cross-referencing multiple official sources when providing compliance decision suppor...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 85/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of l...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including family law, professional lic...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD automatically flag when legal precedents cited in decision support have been subject to circuit splits, pending S...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide regulatory compliance decision support when user queries span multiple regulatory domains without first...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
