Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal automation, such as privacy, bias, and compliance, without significant conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance, and document handling. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as international compliance standards or more detailed data protection measures, could be better addressed..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal automation, such as privacy, bias, and compliance, without significant conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance, and document handling. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as international compliance standards or more detailed data protection measures, could be better addressed.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 5, SPEC 15 and SPEC 13), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical areas is sometimes beneficial, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across diverse scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 70) SHOULD rewrite requests for case outcome prediction algorithms into legal research assistance tools ...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST detect requests for legal code generation that lack jurisdictional context and engage in target...\n  - [3] (Score: 71) MUST NOT generate code that automates judicial decision-making processes or creates algorithmic bias...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
