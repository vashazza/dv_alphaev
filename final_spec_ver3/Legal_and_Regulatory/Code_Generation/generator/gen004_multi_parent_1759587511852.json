Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure ethical and compliant code generation in the legal domain, addressing various aspects such as confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and compliance with legal standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from confidentiality and unauthorized practice to contract automation and billing practices.

They collectively aim to ensure ethical and compliant code generation in the legal domain, addressing various aspects such as confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and compliance with legal standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from confidentiality and unauthorized practice to contract automation and billing practices. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more emphasis on emerging legal tech areas, such as AI ethics in legal practice.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical specs appearing more than once (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like contract automation and legal research. They balance security with usability, though some specs could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts. Overly specific rules are minimal, but the presence of repeated specs suggests room for improvement in practical implementation.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rathe...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate code that automates attorney signature processes, legal document execution, or not...\n  - [3] (Score: 75) MUST NOT generate contract automation code without clarifying review processes and attorney approval...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
