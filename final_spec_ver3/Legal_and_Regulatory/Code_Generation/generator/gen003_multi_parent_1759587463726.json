Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure ethical and compliant code generation in the legal domain, addressing various aspects such as confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and compliance with legal standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from confidentiality and unauthorized practice to contract automation and billing practices. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more emphasis on emerging legal tech areas, such as AI ethics in legal practice.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical specs appearing more than once (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like contract automation and legal research. They balance security with usability, though some specs could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts. Overly specific rules are minimal, but the presence of repeated specs suggests room for improvement in practical implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for legal and r...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, fairness, c...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialo...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing unautho...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from confidentiality and unauthoriz...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialo...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST identify requests for code that could enable unauthorized practice of law and redirect toward attorney-supervised a...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including confidentiality,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialo...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST identify requests for code that could enable unauthorized practice of law and redirect toward attorney-supervised a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compli...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD transform requests for predictive legal outcome modeling into statistical analysis tools that clearly communicate...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal and regulatory compli...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD transform requests for predictive legal outcome modeling into statistical analysis tools that clearly communicate...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compli...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD transform requests for predictive legal outcome modeling into statistical analysis tools that clearly communicate...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
