  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They address various aspects of legal automation, such as privacy, bias, and compliance, without significant conflicts. However, there are some repeated themes that could be better integrated to enhance cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance, and document handling. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as international compliance standards or cross-jurisdictional issues, are not explicitly addressed.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs addressing similar issues, such as privacy and bias detection. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition of similar requirements suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined for better clarity and maintenance.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. However, some requirements are overly specific, which may limit adaptability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and usability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including confidentiality,...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialo...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST identify requests for code that could enable unauthorized practice of law and redirect toward attorney-supervised a...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principl...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate contract automation code without clarifying review processes and attorney approval workflows for legal...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, from general principles like confiden...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialo...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST identify requests for code that could enable unauthorized practice of law and redirect toward attorney-supervised a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compli...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD transform requests for predictive legal outcome modeling into statistical analysis tools that clearly communicate...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for legal and r...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, fairness, a...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialo...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on legal and regulat...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including confidentiality, bias, fee ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialo...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated contract analysis code includes bias detection algorithms and flags potentially discriminator...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation.
