    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They address various aspects of legal automation, such as privacy, bias, and compliance, without apparent conflicts. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance logical connections, such as linking privacy protocols with data retention policies.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance, and document handling. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on international legal standards or cross-jurisdictional issues, which are critical in a globalized legal environment.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 12 and SPEC 1). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability and implementation in diverse scenarios."
