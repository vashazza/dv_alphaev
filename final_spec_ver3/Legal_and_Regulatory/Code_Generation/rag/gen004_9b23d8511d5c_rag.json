    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They address various aspects of legal automation, such as privacy, bias, and compliance, without significant conflicts. However, there are some repeated themes that could be better integrated to enhance cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance, and document handling. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as international compliance standards or cross-jurisdictional issues, are not explicitly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs addressing similar issues, such as privacy and bias detection. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition of similar requirements suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined for better clarity and maintenance.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. However, some requirements are overly specific, which may limit adaptability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and usability."
