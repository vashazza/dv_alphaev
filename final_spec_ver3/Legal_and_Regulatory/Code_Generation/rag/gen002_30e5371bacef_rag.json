    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal practice, such as confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, from confidentiality and unauthorized practice to contract automation and billing. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as bias detection in contracts and citation verification in legal research. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit focus on emerging technologies like AI in legal contexts.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical specs appearing more than once (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as contract automation and legal research. However, some specs could be overly specific, such as those focusing on particular legal processes, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
