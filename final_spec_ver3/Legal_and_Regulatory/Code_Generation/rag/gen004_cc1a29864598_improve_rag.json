    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure ethical and compliant code generation in the legal domain, addressing various aspects such as confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and compliance with legal standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from confidentiality and unauthorized practice to contract automation and billing practices. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more emphasis on emerging legal tech areas, such as AI ethics in legal practice.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical specs appearing more than once (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like contract automation and legal research. They balance security with usability, though some specs could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts. Overly specific rules are minimal, but the presence of repeated specs suggests room for improvement in practical implementation."
