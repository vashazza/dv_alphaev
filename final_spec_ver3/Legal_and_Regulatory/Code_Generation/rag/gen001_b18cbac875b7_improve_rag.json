    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal automation, such as privacy, bias, and compliance, without significant conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance, and document handling. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as international compliance standards or more detailed data protection measures, could be better addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 5, SPEC 15 and SPEC 13), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical areas is sometimes beneficial, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across diverse scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
