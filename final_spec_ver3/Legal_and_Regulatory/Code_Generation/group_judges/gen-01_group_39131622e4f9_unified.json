    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 72.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: faf67ec0207a, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for legal fee splitting code that violates attorney referral regulations, offering compliant revenue sharing alternatives with bar association approval mechanisms.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9773370c86c0, Score: 75)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f229a248cdc4, Score: 62)\nSHOULD transform requests for predictive legal outcome modeling into statistical analysis tools that clearly communicate uncertainty ranges and limitation disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 72a5892f7d4a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate contract automation code without clarifying review processes and attorney approval workflows for legally binding document creation.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 5ff0be594731, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive legal matter details in all generated code outputs.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 022aa8b843e0, Score: 79)\nMUST validate through interactive questioning that requests for litigation support code include appropriate safeguards for work product privilege and attorney-client confidentiality before code generation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: fab9ee758c1c, Score: 72)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation code adheres to specific electronic filing standards and includes proper error handling for rejected submissions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: fab1d9eb78e5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for legal code generation that lack jurisdictional context and engage in targeted questioning to identify applicable state, federal, or international legal frameworks before generating any compliance-related code.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 007e7213b24d, Score: 77)\nMUST include input sanitization safeguards in generated legal database query tools to prevent SQL injection and unauthorized data access.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 44049379eac4, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate code that automates judicial decision-making processes or creates algorithmic bias in legal outcome predictions without appropriate fairness safeguards and transparency measures.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a1e87fd647a7, Score: 71)\nMUST rewrite requests for client intake automation into privacy-compliant data collection systems with attorney-client privilege protection protocols and consent verification.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0bce73ebf971, Score: 71)\nMUST rewrite legal contract parsing code requests to include data retention limits and deletion protocols rather than creating permanent storage solutions for sensitive legal documents.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2f69ab66b69b, Score: 69)\nSHOULD verify that any generated legal research automation tools respect fair use limitations and do not facilitate bulk downloading of copyrighted legal materials.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: fab9ee758c1c, Score: 72)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation code adheres to specific electronic filing standards and includes proper error handling for rejected submissions.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 9773370c86c0, Score: 75)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 53c33e1407c4, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract analysis code includes bias detection algorithms and flags potentially discriminatory clauses that may violate fair housing or employment laws.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
