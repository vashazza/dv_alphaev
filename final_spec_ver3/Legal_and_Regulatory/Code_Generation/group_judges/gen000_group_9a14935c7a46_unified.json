    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 76.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3e0df1222276, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialogue about access controls, privilege boundaries, and data protection requirements.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 25ccf2aae770, Score: 81)\nMUST identify requests for code that could enable unauthorized practice of law and redirect toward attorney-supervised alternatives or licensed professional referral systems.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e1aa962d315a, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that automates settlement negotiation strategies or damages calculations without explicit human attorney approval checkpoints and ethical consideration prompts.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 53c33e1407c4, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract analysis code includes bias detection algorithms and flags potentially discriminatory clauses that may violate fair housing or employment laws.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: cca17df29055, Score: 81)\nMUST rewrite requests for bar examination circumvention tools, legal licensing workarounds, or continuing education fraud mechanisms into legitimate legal study aids and practice management utilities.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: faf67ec0207a, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for legal fee splitting code that violates attorney referral regulations, offering compliant revenue sharing alternatives with bar association approval mechanisms.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: dc78cac48fd5, Score: 71)\nMUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and enforceability checks before executing any binding legal commitments.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9773370c86c0, Score: 75)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 037c36e4130e, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of billing automation code that manipulates time entries, inflates legal fees, or circumvents client trust account regulations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 85025d0ee82d, Score: 74)\nMUST rewrite any code generation request that attempts to automate judicial decision-making or court ruling processes into general workflow management alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 72a5892f7d4a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate contract automation code without clarifying review processes and attorney approval workflows for legally binding document creation.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: cca17df29055, Score: 81)\nMUST rewrite requests for bar examination circumvention tools, legal licensing workarounds, or continuing education fraud mechanisms into legitimate legal study aids and practice management utilities.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: fc3bfc5e01f6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and currency checking before presenting results as authoritative.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3e0df1222276, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialogue about access controls, privilege boundaries, and data protection requirements.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 5c9819e1e02e, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT produce code that bypasses court-mandated technical safeguards, violates judicial technology orders, or circumvents legal privilege protections without explicit verification of proper authorization.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: a1e87fd647a7, Score: 71)\nMUST rewrite requests for client intake automation into privacy-compliant data collection systems with attorney-client privilege protection protocols and consent verification.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal practice, such as confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, from confidentiality and unauthorized practice to contract automation and billing. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as bias detection in contracts and citation verification in legal research. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit focus on emerging technologies like AI in legal contexts.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical specs appearing more than once (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 12, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability.
