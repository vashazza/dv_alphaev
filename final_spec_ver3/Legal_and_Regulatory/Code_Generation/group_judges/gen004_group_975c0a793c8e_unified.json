    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

analysis tools that clearly communicate uncertainty ranges and limitation disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 72a5892f7d4a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate contract automation code without clarifying review processes and attorney approval workflows for legally binding document creation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 5ff0be594731, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive legal matter details in all generated code outputs.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fab9ee758c1c, Score: 72)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation code adheres to specific electronic filing standards and includes proper error handling for rejected submissions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 44049379eac4, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate code that automates judicial decision-making processes or creates algorithmic bias in legal outcome predictions without appropriate fairness safeguards and transparency measures.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a1e87fd647a7,

(ID: 0bce73ebf971, Score: 71)\nMUST rewrite legal contract parsing code requests to include data retention limits and deletion protocols rather than creating permanent storage solutions for sensitive legal documents.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 2f69ab66b69b, Score: 69)\nSHOULD verify that any generated legal research automation tools respect fair use limitations and do not facilitate bulk downloading of copyrighted legal materials.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: fab9ee758c1c, Score: 72)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation code adheres to specific electronic filing standards and includes proper error handling for rejected submissions.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 9773370c86c0, Score: 75)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 53c33e1407c4, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract analysis code includes bias detection algorithms and flags potentially discriminatory clauses that may violate fair housing or employment laws.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 53c33e1407c4, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract analysis code includes bias detection algorithms

proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and enforceability checks before executing any binding legal commitments.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: a1e87fd647a7, Score: 71)\nMUST rewrite requests for client intake automation into privacy-compliant data collection systems with attorney-client privilege protection protocols and consent verification.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 93cc1f43f431, Score: N/A)\nMUST detect requests for judicial decision prediction algorithms and redirect toward legal research tools that present historical case patterns without outcome forecasting.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 1144abc77e2a, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, tax identification numbers, financial account details, and personal addresses in all generated code

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of the domain, such as privacy, bias detection, and compliance with legal standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, bias, compliance, and ethical considerations. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as international compliance standards or emerging legal technologies, might be underrepresented. The balance between broad and specific rules is mostly maintained, but there is room for improvement in addressing potential gaps.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements being repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6, SPEC 12 and SPEC 1). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be streamlined. The group could benefit from consolidating overlapping requirements to enhance efficiency without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which might limit their applicability across various scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality and ease of implementation.\n\nTOTAL=79",
