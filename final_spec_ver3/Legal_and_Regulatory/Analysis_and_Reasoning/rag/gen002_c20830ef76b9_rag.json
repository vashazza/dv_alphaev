    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They cover various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as verifying the validity of legal authorities, ensuring jurisdictional context, and maintaining logical traceability. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on current enforcement priorities and the need for professional consultation in time-sensitive situations. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including statutory analysis, jurisdictional context, and the distinction between legal research and advice. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting reasoning fallacies and masking personally identifiable information. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which are critical compliance areas in the modern legal landscape.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., Specs 5 and 8 are duplicates). While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as seeking jurisdictional clarification and emphasizing professional consultation. The specifications balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on temporal validity and jurisdictional context, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
