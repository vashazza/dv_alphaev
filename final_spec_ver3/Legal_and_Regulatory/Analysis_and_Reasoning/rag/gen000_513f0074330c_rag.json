    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal analysis, such as methodological limitations, jurisdictional context, and confidentiality. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as the repeated emphasis on temporal references (Specs 6 and 10) and regulatory compliance advice (Specs 11 and 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like jurisdictional context and confidentiality, while also tackling specific issues such as logical fallacies and ambiguous statutory language. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit coverage for emerging legal technologies or cross-border legal issues.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with Specs 6 and 10, and Specs 11 and 14, which address similar issues. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictions and legal standards. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit confidence levels in contract clause interpretations, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios."
