    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They address various aspects of legal analysis, from methodological limitations to privacy concerns, and there are logical connections between them. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as overlapping specs on masking personally identifiable information.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including methodological rigor, jurisdictional clarity, privacy, and compliance with current enforcement priorities. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies and cross-jurisdictional issues.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs related to masking personally identifiable information and temporal reference clarifications. While redundancy can enhance robustness, these overlaps could be consolidated for efficiency without losing critical safety measures.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit confidence levels in contract clause interpretations, which may hinder practical implementation."
