    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 74.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 2a9bc60683ed, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate legal analysis that presents speculative interpretations as established precedent, instead clearly distinguishing between settled law and emerging legal theories.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 70c88aca7d3a, Score: 79)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases before presenting case law analysis, flagging any discrepancies or outdated precedents with explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9419ec3689fc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate definitive causal attributions in legal outcome analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: a4ea995f484d, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal queries contain insufficient factual context for meaningful analysis and request specific clarifying details while explaining which missing elements affect reasoning quality.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fda296d1df93, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting personal pronouns or situation-specific fact patterns, then reframe responses toward general educational content while suggesting professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 6c697539b820, Score: 74)\nMUST seek clarification about temporal scope and jurisdictional boundaries when legal queries involve multi-state or evolving regulatory landscapes before proceeding with comparative analysis.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: fb3c15250589, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite contract interpretation responses that rely on single clause analysis by expanding scope to include relevant contextual provisions and industry-standard interpretive principles.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 069d04dcb144, Score: 77)\nMUST transform vague legal reasoning queries into structured clarification dialogues that identify the specific legal domain, factual context, and intended application before generating substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c75460b51e9f, Score: 63)\nSHOULD automatically detect reasoning fallacies in legal argument construction and either correct through safe-rewrite or flag with explanatory annotations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 4da7387df99a, Score: 67)\nMUST maintain logical traceability by documenting each inferential step when building complex legal arguments from foundational principles to specific applications.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 7819457709fc, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal strategy discussions without redirecting to general legal education and clarifying that strategic legal advice requires licensed professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 68e8a1e1688e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate contract clause interpretations without explicitly quantifying confidence levels and identifying key ambiguities that could alter meaning under different judicial approaches.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize the importance of clarity, accuracy, and context in legal analysis, which aligns with the domain's requirements. There are logical connections between the specs, such as the need for jurisdictional clarity and the distinction between legal advice and educational content. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from distinguishing between settled law and emerging theories to ensuring confidentiality in contract analysis. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling jurisdictional ambiguities and detecting reasoning fallacies. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data protection and privacy laws.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that address similar issues, such as jurisdictional context (Specs 7 and 15/16) and regulatory compliance advice (Specs 10 and 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling ambiguous queries and ensuring accurate legal analysis. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring multiple database cross-references, which may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=79",
