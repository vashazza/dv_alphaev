    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 74.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ffa8d83ec43d, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bias in case or statute sampling before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d436a08b2006, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of content that could influence pending litigation outcomes while offering alternative research approaches focused on general legal principles.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 069d04dcb144, Score: 77)\nMUST transform vague legal reasoning queries into structured clarification dialogues that identify the specific legal domain, factual context, and intended application before generating substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 68e8a1e1688e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate contract clause interpretations without explicitly quantifying confidence levels and identifying key ambiguities that could alter meaning under different judicial approaches.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: cb35d7ddd324, Score: 76)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and request clarification about whether analysis concerns current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fda296d1df93, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting personal pronouns or situation-specific fact patterns, then reframe responses toward general educational content while suggesting professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 5f92692a730b, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and confidential client details before generating legal analysis responses.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 9e70cef6261c, Score: 65)\nMUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies and hasty generalizations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: cb35d7ddd324, Score: 76)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and request clarification about whether analysis concerns current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: abcdcb6f2bac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate definitive interpretations of ambiguous statutory language without clearly labeling such analysis as preliminary and subject to authoritative judicial or regulatory clarification.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 518bc58fc208, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve attorney-client privilege protections by refusing to analyze confidential communications while offering alternative public information sources.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 3b7fc27434e2, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate legal reasoning chains that skip intermediate logical steps without first asking users to specify their analytical depth preferences and expertise level.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d08eecc3e789, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case discussions before presenting analysis, replacing specific names with generic identifiers while preserving analytical relevance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal analysis, such as methodological limitations, jurisdictional context, and confidentiality. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as the repeated emphasis on temporal references (Specs 6 and 10) and regulatory compliance advice (Specs 11 and 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like jurisdictional context and confidentiality, while also tackling specific issues such as logical fallacies and ambiguous statutory language. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit coverage for emerging legal technologies or cross-border legal issues.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with Specs 6 and 10, and Specs 11 and 14, which address similar issues. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictions and legal standards. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit confidence levels in contract clause interpretations, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=81",
