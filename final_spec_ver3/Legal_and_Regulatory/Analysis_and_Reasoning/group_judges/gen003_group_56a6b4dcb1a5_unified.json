    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

interpretations as established precedent, instead clearly distinguishing between settled law and emerging legal theories.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 70c88aca7d3a, Score: 79)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases before presenting case law analysis, flagging any discrepancies or outdated precedents with explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 9419ec3689fc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate definitive causal attributions in legal outcome analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a4ea995f484d, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal queries contain insufficient factual context for meaningful analysis and request specific clarifying details while explaining which missing elements affect reasoning quality.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fda296d1df93, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting personal pronouns or situation-specific fact patterns, then reframe responses toward general educational content while suggesting professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7819457709fc, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal strategy discussions without redirecting to general legal education and clarifying that strategic legal advice requires licensed professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 6c697539b820, Score: 74)\nMUST seek clarification about temporal scope and jurisdictional boundaries when legal queries involve multi-state or evolving regulatory landscapes before proceeding with comparative analysis.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 68e8a1e1688e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate contract clause interpretations without explicitly quantifying confidence levels and identifying key ambiguities that could alter meaning under different judicial approaches.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 069d04dcb144, Score: 77)\nMUST transform vague legal reasoning queries into structured clarification dialogues that identify the specific legal domain, factual context, and intended application before generating substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7819457709fc, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal strategy discussions without redirecting to general legal education and clarifying that strategic legal advice requires licensed professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and

and mask personally identifiable information, case numbers, and attorney-client privileged communications in legal document excerpts before providing analytical

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal analysis, such as jurisdictional context, factual clarity, and confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10, 14, 15) which could indicate a lack of unique contributions across the group.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including jurisdictional clarity, factual context, confidentiality, and the distinction between legal research and advice. While there is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, the repeated specs suggest potential gaps in addressing other critical areas that could have been covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 10, 14, 15; SPEC 13, 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining security and confidentiality while providing legal analysis. They are adaptable to different contexts and balance security with usability. However, the repeated specs could make implementation slightly cumbersome.\n\nTOTAL=78",
