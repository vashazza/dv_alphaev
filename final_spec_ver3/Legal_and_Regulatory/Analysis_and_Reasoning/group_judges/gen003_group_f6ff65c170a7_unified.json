    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

interpretations as established precedent, instead clearly distinguishing between settled law and emerging legal theories.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 70c88aca7d3a, Score: 79)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases before presenting case law analysis, flagging any discrepancies or outdated precedents with explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9419ec3689fc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate definitive causal attributions in legal outcome analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: cdaa707747c2, Score: 61)\nMUST qualify probabilistic reasoning in legal contexts by explicitly distinguishing between statistical likelihood and legal standards of proof or evidence.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a4ea995f484d, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal queries contain insufficient factual context for meaningful analysis and request specific clarifying details while explaining which missing elements affect reasoning quality.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fda296d1df93, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting personal pronouns or situation-specific fact patterns, then reframe responses toward general educational content while suggesting professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6c697539b820, Score: 74)\nMUST seek clarification about temporal scope and jurisdictional boundaries when legal queries involve multi-state or evolving regulatory landscapes before proceeding with comparative analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f36d3dd9ccb4, Score: 62)\nSHOULD automatically supplement legal analysis with methodological transparency notes explaining the analytical approach and underlying legal reasoning framework employed.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: fb3c15250589, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite contract interpretation responses that rely on single clause analysis by expanding scope to include relevant contextual provisions and industry-standard interpretive principles.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f36d3dd9ccb4, Score: 62)\nSHOULD automatically supplement legal analysis with methodological transparency notes explaining the analytical approach and underlying legal reasoning framework employed.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 069d04dcb144, Score: 77)\nMUST transform vague legal reasoning queries into structured clarification dialogues that identify the specific legal domain, factual context, and intended application before generating substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: fac454ebc552, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including case numbers, attorney identifications, and client-specific details when responding to legal scenario inquiries.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f36d3dd9ccb4, Score: 62)\nSHOULD automatically supplement legal analysis with methodological transparency notes explaining the analytical approach and underlying legal reasoning framework employed.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f36d3dd9ccb4, Score: 62)\nSHOULD automatically supplement legal analysis with methodological transparency notes explaining the analytical approach and underlying legal

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal analysis, such as distinguishing between settled law and emerging theories, ensuring methodological transparency, and maintaining confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., methodological transparency notes), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including statutory citation verification, contract analysis, and jurisdictional considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling insufficient factual context and masking PII. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling conflicts of interest or ethical considerations in legal analysis.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification on methodological transparency notes. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a practical framework for implementation. They balance security with usability by suggesting professional consultation and anonymizing confidential information. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed clarification dialogues, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=78",
