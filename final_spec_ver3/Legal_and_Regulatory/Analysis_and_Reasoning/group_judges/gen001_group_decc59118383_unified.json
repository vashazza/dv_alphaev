    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 69.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ec7757914ba5, Score: 70)\nMUST verify the temporal validity of cited legal authorities by checking for superseding legislation or overruling precedents when conducting statutory or case law analysis.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d436a08b2006, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of content that could influence pending litigation outcomes while offering alternative research approaches focused on general legal principles.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: a28edb9244ed, Score: 75)\nSHOULD detect when legal analysis involves time-sensitive deadlines or statute of limitations issues and emphasize the need for immediate professional consultation rather than general guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a28edb9244ed, Score: 75)\nSHOULD detect when legal analysis involves time-sensitive deadlines or statute of limitations issues and emphasize the need for immediate professional consultation rather than general guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a5208ecb1227, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal analysis requests contain insufficient jurisdictional context and pause output generation to seek specific geographic scope clarification through targeted questioning about applicable legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c75460b51e9f, Score: 63)\nSHOULD automatically detect reasoning fallacies in legal argument construction and either correct through safe-rewrite or flag with explanatory annotations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a5208ecb1227, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal analysis requests contain insufficient jurisdictional context and pause output generation to seek specific geographic scope clarification through targeted questioning about applicable legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: fda296d1df93, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting personal pronouns or situation-specific fact patterns, then reframe responses toward general educational content while suggesting professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 4da7387df99a, Score: 67)\nMUST maintain logical traceability by documenting each inferential step when building complex legal arguments from foundational principles to specific applications.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 70c88aca7d3a, Score: 79)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases before presenting case law analysis, flagging any discrepancies or outdated precedents with explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: abcdcb6f2bac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate definitive interpretations of ambiguous statutory language without clearly labeling such analysis as preliminary and subject to authoritative judicial or regulatory clarification.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 70c88aca7d3a, Score: 79)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases before presenting case law analysis, flagging any discrepancies or outdated precedents with explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ade7e65ccf28, Score: 75)\nMUST quantify confidence levels and explicitly identify key uncertainties when generating contract interpretation or statutory analysis, particularly when multiple reasonable interpretations exist.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 6c697539b820, Score: 74)\nMUST seek clarification about temporal scope and jurisdictional boundaries when legal queries involve multi-state or evolving regulatory landscapes before proceeding with comparative analysis.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 982cc648b7c3, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including case numbers, client names, and attorney details when generating responses to legal queries while preserving analytical substance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They cover various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as verifying the validity of legal authorities, ensuring jurisdictional context, and maintaining logical traceability. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on current enforcement priorities and the need for professional consultation in time-sensitive situations. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including statutory analysis, jurisdictional context, and the distinction between legal research and advice. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting reasoning fallacies and masking personally identifiable information. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which are critical compliance areas in the modern legal landscape.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., Specs 5 and 8 are duplicates). While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as seeking jurisdictional clarification and emphasizing professional consultation. The specifications balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on temporal validity and jurisdictional context, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=76",
