    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 66.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ffa8d83ec43d, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bias in case or statute sampling before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d436a08b2006, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of content that could influence pending litigation outcomes while offering alternative research approaches focused on general legal principles.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 069d04dcb144, Score: 77)\nMUST transform vague legal reasoning queries into structured clarification dialogues that identify the specific legal domain, factual context, and intended application before generating substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 68e8a1e1688e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate contract clause interpretations without explicitly quantifying confidence levels and identifying key ambiguities that could alter meaning under different judicial approaches.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: cb35d7ddd324, Score: 76)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and request clarification about whether analysis concerns current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fda296d1df93, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting personal pronouns or situation-specific fact patterns, then reframe responses toward general educational content while suggesting professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 5f92692a730b, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and confidential client details before generating legal analysis responses.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 9e70cef6261c, Score: 65)\nMUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies and hasty generalizations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: cb35d7ddd324, Score: 76)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and request clarification about whether analysis concerns current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: abcdcb6f2bac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate definitive interpretations of ambiguous statutory language without clearly labeling such analysis as preliminary and subject to authoritative judicial or regulatory clarification.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 518bc58fc208, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve attorney-client privilege protections by refusing to analyze confidential communications while offering alternative public information sources.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 3b7fc27434e2, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate legal reasoning chains that skip intermediate logical steps without first asking users to specify their analytical depth preferences and expertise level.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d08eecc3e789, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case discussions before presenting analysis, replacing specific names with generic identifiers while preserving analytical relevance.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: d19d10fe5845, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in case citations, court documents, and legal correspondence while preserving analytical value through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 705006256da7, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in judicial opinions, court filings, and attorney correspondence while preserving the substantive legal arguments and procedural context.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They address various aspects of legal analysis, from methodological limitations to jurisdictional clarity and confidentiality. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in the handling of personally identifiable information, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, including methodological rigor, jurisdictional clarity, confidentiality, and logical reasoning. It balances general principles with specific protections, such as masking personal information and avoiding definitive interpretations of ambiguous statutes. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific guidance on emerging legal technologies or international legal contexts.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly in specifications related to masking personally identifiable information (Specs 8, 16, 17, 18) and regulatory compliance advice (Specs 11, 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit confidence levels in contract interpretations, which may hinder adaptability in diverse legal contexts.\n\nTOTAL=81",
