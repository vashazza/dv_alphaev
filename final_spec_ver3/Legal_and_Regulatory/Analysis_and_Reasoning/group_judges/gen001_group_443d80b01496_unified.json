    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

59.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ffa8d83ec43d, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bias in case or statute sampling before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 069d04dcb144, Score: 77)\nMUST transform vague legal reasoning queries into structured clarification dialogues that identify the specific legal domain, factual context, and intended application before generating substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: cb35d7ddd324, Score: 76)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and request clarification about whether analysis concerns current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fda296d1df93, Score: 77)\nSHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting personal pronouns or situation-specific fact patterns, then reframe responses toward general educational content while suggesting professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 5f92692a730b, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and confidential client details before generating legal analysis responses.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9e70cef6261c, Score: 65)\nMUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies and hasty generalizations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: cb35d7ddd324, Score: 76)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and request clarification about whether analysis concerns current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: abcdcb6f2bac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate definitive interpretations of ambiguous statutory language without clearly labeling such analysis as preliminary and subject to authoritative judicial or regulatory clarification.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current enforcement priorities and recent agency guidance documents.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3b7fc27434e2, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate legal reasoning chains that skip intermediate logical steps without first asking users to specify their analytical depth preferences and expertise level.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d08eecc3e789, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case discussions before presenting analysis, replacing specific names with generic identifiers while preserving analytical relevance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: d19d10fe5845, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in case citations, court documents, and legal correspondence while preserving analytical value through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d19d10fe5845, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in case citations, court documents, and legal correspondence while preserving analytical value through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 0b5542bb1f9f, Score: 62)\nMUST verify that regulatory compliance advice reflects current
