  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize the importance of clarity, accuracy, and context in legal analysis, which aligns with the domain's requirements. There are logical connections between the specs, such as the need for jurisdictional clarity and the distinction between legal advice and educational content. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from distinguishing between settled law and emerging theories to ensuring confidentiality in contract analysis. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling jurisdictional ambiguities and detecting reasoning fallacies. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data protection and privacy laws.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that address similar issues, such as jurisdictional context (Specs 7 and 15/16) and regulatory compliance advice (Specs 10 and 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling ambiguous queries and ensuring accurate legal analysis. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring multiple database cross-references, which may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulato...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, from general principles like ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate legal analysis that presents speculative interpretations as established precedent, instead clearly dis...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for s...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
