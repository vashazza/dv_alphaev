Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They address various aspects of legal analysis, such as verifying the validity of legal authorities, ensuring compliance with current regulations, and maintaining logical traceability. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including statutory analysis, jurisdictional context, and the distinction between legal research and advice. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some critical areas, such as data privacy or international law, are not explicitly covered, indicating potential gaps.. Redundancy: There are several instances of redundancy, with identical specifications appearing multiple times (e.g., Specs 5 and 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing the need for professional consultation and clarifying uncertainties. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing gene...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate legal analysis that presents speculative interpretations as established precedent, instead clearly dis...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for s...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
