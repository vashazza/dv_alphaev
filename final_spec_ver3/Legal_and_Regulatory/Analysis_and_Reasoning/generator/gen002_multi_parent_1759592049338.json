Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal analysis and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal reasoning, such as jurisdictional clarity, methodological transparency, and the distinction between legal advice and education. However, there are some overlaps, particularly with jurisdictional context (SPEC 2 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like jurisdictional clarity and methodological transparency while also tackling specific issues such as contract analysis and probabilistic reasoning. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or cross-border legal challenges, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive..

They complement each other by covering different facets of legal reasoning, such as jurisdictional clarity, methodological transparency, and the distinction between legal advice and education. However, there are some overlaps, particularly with jurisdictional context (SPEC 2 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like jurisdictional clarity and methodological transparency while also tackling specific issues such as contract analysis and probabilistic reasoning. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or cross-border legal challenges, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (SPEC 2 and SPEC 13, SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas like jurisdictional clarity, the repetition of similar rules suggests room for streamlining without compromising robustness.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and emphasize the importance of clarifying ambiguous queries. However, some specifications could be overly specific, such as those requiring explicit confidence levels in contract clause interpretations, which may not always be practical in real-world scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 61) MUST qualify probabilistic reasoning in legal contexts by explicitly distinguishing between statisti...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST NOT generate legal reasoning that presents speculative interpretations as established doctrine ...\n  - [3] (Score: 80) MUST NOT generate content that presents probabilistic legal outcomes as certainties, instead qualify...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
