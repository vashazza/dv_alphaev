Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes clarity, accuracy, and the distinction between legal research and advice. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal analysis, such as jurisdictional clarity, factual context, and confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10, 14, 15) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal analysis aspects, including jurisdictional clarity, factual context, confidentiality, and the distinction between legal research and advice. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling confidential information and ambiguous legal queries. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as ethical considerations and technology-specific legal challenges.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 10, 14, 15) that could be consolidated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases and adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications could be more concise to enhance real-world implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulato...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including methodological rigor, juris...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bia...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect and refuse generation of content that could influence pending litigation outcomes while offering alternative...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
