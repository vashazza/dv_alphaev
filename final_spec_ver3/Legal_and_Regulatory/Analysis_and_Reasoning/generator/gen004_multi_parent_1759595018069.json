Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal analysis, such as distinguishing between settled law and emerging theories, ensuring methodological transparency, and maintaining confidentiality. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated emphasis on transparency notes and regulatory compliance advice, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from general principles like distinguishing between legal standards and statistical likelihoods to specific tasks like anonymizing confidential contract terms. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling international legal queries or addressing ethical considerations in AI-generated legal advice. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is mostly maintained, but could be improved..

They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal analysis, such as distinguishing between settled law and emerging theories, ensuring methodological transparency, and maintaining confidentiality. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated emphasis on transparency notes and regulatory compliance advice, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from general principles like distinguishing between legal standards and statistical likelihoods to specific tasks like anonymizing confidential contract terms. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling international legal queries or addressing ethical considerations in AI-generated legal advice. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is mostly maintained, but could be improved.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with the repetition of certain requirements, such as the need for transparency notes and verifying regulatory compliance advice. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation, such as requesting clarifying details for insufficient factual contexts and transforming vague queries into structured dialogues. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on single clause analysis or specific pronoun detection, which may limit flexibility and adaptability in different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 77) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate analysis that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by detecting personal ...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
