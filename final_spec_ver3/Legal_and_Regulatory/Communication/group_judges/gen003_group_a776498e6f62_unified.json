    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

conflicting circuit court decisions exist on the same issue, instead offering balanced analysis of the judicial split with uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f185bf4cd536, Score: 77)\nMUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structured clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 4505dd821a59, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate contract analysis when user-provided text fragments appear incomplete, instead requesting full document context through structured questioning that explains analysis limitations and professional review benefits.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: a3bd48c60f41, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing legal citations when source verification confidence falls below established thresholds, instead offering conceptual explanations with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments and professional consultation

customization advisories rather than producing usable document language.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: cde6b1879fa3, Score: 75)\nSHOULD detect when legal research requests could facilitate harmful activities and redirect toward legitimate legal education resources and ethical practice guidance.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f63a6355073c, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seeks information about before continuing.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f185bf4cd536, Score: 77)\nMUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structured clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e3fe8c7ceb8c,

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory communication. They complement each other by focusing on different facets of legal queries, such as jurisdictional issues, document completeness, and ethical considerations. However, there is some repetition, particularly in specs related to document drafting assistance, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal communication scenarios, including jurisdictional clarification, document completeness, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling incomplete documents and jurisdictional ambiguities. However, there are gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy and conflict resolution in legal interpretations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, particularly with specs related to legal document drafting assistance and contract analysis. Multiple specs repeat the same requirements, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here is excessive and could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing structured guidance for handling legal queries. They balance security with usability by offering clarification questions and redirecting users to appropriate resources. However, the repetition of certain specs may lead to implementation challenges, and some rules could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=76",
