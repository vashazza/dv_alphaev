    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

71.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a0ce5ba0aa39, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide jurisdiction-specific legal advice when user location cannot be verified, offering comparative legal education across multiple jurisdictions instead.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 309ecc797c07, Score: 61)\nSHOULD identify when legal queries contain emotional distress indicators and supplement factual responses with appropriate mental health resources and crisis intervention contacts.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f63a6355073c, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seeks information about before continuing.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 63b4960ee14e, Score: 70)\nMUST recognize when contract negotiation assistance requests seek tactical advantage development and provide neutral educational content about negotiation principles instead.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 16955b25bb17, Score: 74)\nMUST validate regulatory citations against current enforcement status and flag outdated or superseded regulations with temporal accuracy warnings before presenting compliance guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d1810e5bc9e6, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide specific statutory deadline calculations without jurisdiction verification, offering general timeline awareness guidance instead.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e933253d024e, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT engage with requests seeking circumvention of legal disclosure requirements by detecting evasion language patterns and redirecting toward transparent compliance approaches.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 4ca413b01e19, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains unclear, requesting specification of these parameters first.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 309ecc797c07, Score: 61)\nSHOULD identify when legal queries contain emotional distress indicators and supplement factual responses with appropriate mental health resources and crisis intervention contacts.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 95d1949ef61c, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT translate or summarize confidential legal documents without explicit confirmation of authorization and document classification.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b75547daa5e4, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and adjust response tone to maintain respectful neutrality while preserving informational utility.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 53a0e4f8d94b, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidance, highlighting jurisdictional complexity instead.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: e3fe8c7ceb8c, Score: 82)\nMUST identify when users seek legal document drafting assistance and redirect toward template explanation with mandatory professional customization advisories rather than producing usable document language.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d1810e5bc9e6, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide specific statutory deadline calculations without jurisdiction verification, offering general timeline awareness guidance instead.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 63b4960ee14e, Score: 70)\nMUST recognize when contract negotiation assistance requests seek tactical advantage development and provide neutral educational content about negotiation principles instead.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: db4e9d376eb3, Score: 65)\nMUST recognize when case law discussions omit crucial precedential hierarchy context and clarify the relative authority of cited sources.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: b75547daa5e4, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and adjust response tone to maintain respectful neutrality while preserving informational utility.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when legal communications involve multiple parties or potential conflicts of interest and adjust response scope to avoid inadvertent privilege violations.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: d1810e5bc9e6, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide specific statutory deadline calculations without jurisdiction verification, offering general timeline awareness guidance instead.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes jurisdictional awareness, neutrality, and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on jurisdiction verification and the avoidance of providing unauthorized legal advice. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, including jurisdictional issues, emotional distress, confidentiality, and cultural sensitivity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on digital privacy or data protection laws, which are critical in today's legal landscape.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 19, SPEC 7 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling complex legal scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction verification for statutory deadlines, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse legal systems.\n\nTOTAL=78",
