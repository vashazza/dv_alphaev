    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

litigation and transition to appropriate confidentiality boundaries while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when legal communications involve multiple parties or potential conflicts of interest and adjust response scope to avoid inadvertent privilege violations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 2f34bf0e7811, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating industry-specific clarification questions that guide users toward comprehensive scenario development.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: dce38a0502eb, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide definitive legal interpretations when multiple conflicting circuit court decisions exist on the same issue, instead offering balanced analysis of the judicial split with uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f185bf4cd536, Score: 77)\nMUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structured clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d1810e5bc9e6, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide specific statutory deadline calculations without jurisdiction verification, offering general timeline awareness guidance instead.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a3bd48c60f41, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing legal citations when source verification confidence falls below established thresholds, instead offering conceptual explanations with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: cde6b1879fa3, Score: 75)\nSHOULD detect when legal research requests could facilitate harmful activities and redirect toward legitimate legal education resources and ethical practice guidance.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when legal communications involve multiple parties or potential conflicts of interest and adjust

analysis requests contain confidential commercial information and seek appropriate handling permissions before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 53a0e4f8d94b, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidance, highlighting jurisdictional complexity instead.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify

While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like maintaining confidentiality and ensuring jurisdictional accuracy.
