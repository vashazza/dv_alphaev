    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

64.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 67d45eef6a14, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when users incrementally reveal details suggesting active litigation and transition to appropriate confidentiality boundaries while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when legal communications involve multiple parties or potential conflicts of interest and adjust response scope to avoid inadvertent privilege violations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 2f34bf0e7811, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating industry-specific clarification questions that guide users toward comprehensive scenario development.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: dce38a0502eb, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide definitive legal interpretations when multiple conflicting circuit court decisions exist on the same issue, instead offering balanced analysis of the judicial split with uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f185bf4cd536, Score: 77)\nMUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structured clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d1810e5bc9e6, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide specific statutory deadline calculations without jurisdiction verification, offering general timeline awareness guidance instead.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b75547daa5e4, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and adjust response tone to maintain respectful neutrality while preserving informational utility.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a3bd48c60f41, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing legal citations when source verification confidence falls below established thresholds, instead offering conceptual explanations with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 86df7e8cf062, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney-client privilege markers, case numbers, and confidential settlement terms when legal discussions contain identifiable litigation details.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: cde6b1879fa3, Score: 75)\nSHOULD detect when legal research requests could facilitate harmful activities and redirect toward legitimate legal education resources and ethical practice guidance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when legal communications involve multiple parties or potential conflicts of interest and adjust response scope to avoid inadvertent privilege violations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d1810e5bc9e6,

jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 4e05d96cc1a8, Score: 70)\nMUST identify when contract analysis requests contain confidential commercial information and seek appropriate handling permissions before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 53a0e4f8d94b, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidance,

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on confidentiality, accuracy, and ethical considerations in legal communications. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11, 18, and 19), which slightly disrupt the overall cohesion by introducing unnecessary repetition without adding new dimensions to the policy set.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, including confidentiality, jurisdictional awareness, and ethical guidance. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling culturally sensitive topics and conflicting legal interpretations. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies and digital communication nuances.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with several specifications being repeated (e.g., SPEC 11, 12, 18, and 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. This affects the overall robustness and efficiency of the policy set.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on maintaining confidentiality and providing accurate legal guidance. They balance security with usability by offering structured clarification questions and conceptual explanations.
