    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for handling legal and regulatory communications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal communication, such as confidentiality, jurisdiction, and document handling. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 14, SPEC 7 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including confidentiality, jurisdictional differences, and document handling. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules repeated (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 14, SPEC 7 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the redundancy could be better managed.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for handling various legal scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts."
