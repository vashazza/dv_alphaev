    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal communication, such as confidentiality, jurisdictional awareness, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs, which slightly disrupt the logical flow and cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication issues, balancing general principles with specific scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing foundational rules, and the focus on specific edge cases could be more balanced.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs repeated verbatim. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts, slightly reducing their practicality."
