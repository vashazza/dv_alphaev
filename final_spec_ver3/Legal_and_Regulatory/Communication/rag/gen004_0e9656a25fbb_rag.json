    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as jurisdictional issues, document handling, and user guidance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on jurisdiction verification and the need for complete factual scenarios before proceeding. However, there is some repetition, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including jurisdictional complexities, document handling, and user guidance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emotional distress indicators and culturally sensitive topics. While the coverage is comprehensive, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules about jurisdiction verification and factual scenario completeness. While these are critical areas, the repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The redundancy is not excessive, but it does impact the overall score.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidance on jurisdictional issues and document handling. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those addressing emotional distress indicators, which may not be easily implementable in all contexts. The rules are adaptable but could benefit from more flexibility."
