    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of legal communication, confidentiality, and jurisdictional issues. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on context and jurisdictional clarity. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 7), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, including confidentiality, jurisdictional issues, and document handling. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which are critical in the current legal landscape.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules being repeated (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 2, SPEC 15 and SPEC 7). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness without excessive duplication, but there is room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide structured guidance for handling incomplete or ambiguous legal queries. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction verification for statutory deadlines, which may limit flexibility in broader applications."
