  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as confidentiality, jurisdictional clarity, and document drafting. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 14-15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, from handling incomplete information to addressing jurisdictional complexities. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, there are some gaps in addressing broader foundational rules, such as general compliance strategies or overarching legal principles.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10, SPEC 12, SPEC 14-15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining conversational momentum and providing structured guidance. They balance security with usability by offering clarification questions and professional consultation recommendations. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
