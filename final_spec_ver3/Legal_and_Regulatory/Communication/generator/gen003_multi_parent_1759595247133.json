They address various aspects of legal communication, such as confidentiality, jurisdictional awareness, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs, which slightly disrupt the logical flow and cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication issues, balancing general principles with specific scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing foundational rules, and the focus on specific edge cases could be more balanced.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs repeated verbatim. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specs are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts, slightly reducing their practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST recognize when case law discussions omit crucial precedential hierarchy context and clarify the...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structur...\n  - [3] (Score: 84) MUST NOT proceed with contract clause interpretation when multiple conflicting legal frameworks coul...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
