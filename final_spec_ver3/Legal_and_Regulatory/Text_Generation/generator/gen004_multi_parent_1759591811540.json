Average group score: 85.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal text generation, such as statutory alignment, jurisdictional considerations, and professional licensing. There are logical connections between requirements, forming a coherent strategy to ensure compliance and prevent unauthorized legal practice.. Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. General principles, such as verifying statutory requirements and jurisdictional context, are well-represented, while specific protections, like redacting confidential strategies and preventing unauthorized practice, address critical compliance areas. There are no significant gaps in coverage, but a slight increase in specific edge-case rules could enhance comprehensiveness..

They complement each other by covering different facets of legal text generation, such as statutory alignment, jurisdictional considerations, and professional licensing. There are logical connections between requirements, forming a coherent strategy to ensure compliance and prevent unauthorized legal practice.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. General principles, such as verifying statutory requirements and jurisdictional context, are well-represented, while specific protections, like redacting confidential strategies and preventing unauthorized practice, address critical compliance areas. There are no significant gaps in coverage, but a slight increase in specific edge-case rules could enhance comprehensiveness.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: The specifications avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. There is some overlap in areas like jurisdictional verification and professional consultation recommendations, but this redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. Overall, the group efficiently consolidates requirements without waste, ensuring a streamlined policy set.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. The specifications are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases and adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules could be perceived as overly specific, such as those requiring temporal accuracy verification, which might complicate implementation in dynamic legal environments.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 74) MUST NOT generate text containing specific statutory interpretations or regulatory guidance without ...\n  - [2] (Score: 66) MUST transform requests for case outcome predictions into balanced analysis of relevant precedents w...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST NOT produce text that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by transforming specific le...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
