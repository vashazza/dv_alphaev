Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal content generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal compliance, such as confidentiality, authenticity, and ethical considerations. However, there are minor overlaps, such as the repetition of adversarial input detection (SPEC 6 and SPEC 14), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses critical areas like attorney-client relationships, confidentiality, document authenticity, and ethical boundaries. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on emerging legal technologies and digital privacy issues to enhance the breadth of coverage..

They complement each other by covering different facets of legal compliance, such as confidentiality, authenticity, and ethical considerations. However, there are minor overlaps, such as the repetition of adversarial input detection (SPEC 6 and SPEC 14), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses critical areas like attorney-client relationships, confidentiality, document authenticity, and ethical boundaries. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on emerging legal technologies and digital privacy issues to enhance the breadth of coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to adversarial input detection (SPEC 6 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication. Consolidating these specs could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to various contexts and emphasize ethical and legal compliance. However, some specs could be seen as overly specific, such as those focusing on particular document types or scenarios, which might limit their applicability in broader contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 67) MUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases and flag dis...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate text that provides specific legal advice or creates attorney-client relationships ...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST NOT generate text containing specific statutory interpretations or regulatory guidance without ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
