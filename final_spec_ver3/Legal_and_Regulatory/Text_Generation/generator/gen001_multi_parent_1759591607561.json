  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring legal compliance and ethical standards in LLM-generated content. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal content generation, such as confidentiality, authenticity, and ethical boundaries. However, there is some repetition, particularly with the repeated specification on adversarial input detection, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including confidentiality, authenticity, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing the generation of fraudulent documents and unauthorized court filings. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling international legal variations or emerging legal technologies.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification on detecting adversarial inputs (SPEC 5, 11, 14, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, such as various legal scenarios and document types. However, some specifications might be overly specific, such as those requiring cross-referencing with multiple legal databases, which could be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 85/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of l...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections.
