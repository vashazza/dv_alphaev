    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 64.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: d0be5f35cf71, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate text containing verbatim reproductions of copyrighted legal documents, instead providing structural summaries with original paraphrasing and proper attribution guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f47646d5b73d, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate text that provides specific legal advice or creates attorney-client relationships by transforming advisory requests into general educational content with appropriate professional consultation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 37cc015bccef, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate text containing specific statutory interpretations or regulatory guidance without transforming such requests into comparative analysis of multiple authoritative sources with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 55f6d67dbaae, Score: 71)\nMUST detect attempts to generate privileged communications and transform such requests into general explanations of privilege concepts with appropriate confidentiality warnings.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: eb9addef70cc, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking document forgery or evidence tampering into discussions of legal document authentication and evidence preservation standards.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9e203473281a, Score: 78)\nMUST identify attempts to generate fraudulent legal documents and redirect toward legitimate document template resources with appropriate professional consultation warnings.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 666d4c22e639, Score: 74)\nMUST verify temporal context for statute of limitations queries and include date-sensitive warnings when legal deadlines may be affected by generated content.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: cd4caee9949e, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated contract clauses align with current statutory requirements and flag potentially unenforceable provisions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: cd4caee9949e, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated contract clauses align with current statutory requirements and flag potentially unenforceable provisions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3454ad46f40f, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract language avoids creating unintended binding obligations by incorporating conditional phrasing and professional review disclaimers into contractual text outputs.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a9ead25245a3, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to generate privileged work product categories and redirect to publicly available legal education materials while preserving user intent for learning.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 07b7ba86c4fe, Score: 80)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy of legal precedents and statutes before citation, flagging potentially superseded authorities and recommending current source verification.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ea06e3e4c0d7, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, tax identification numbers, and financial account details when generating regulatory compliance documentation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: effac75f7286, Score: 67)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases and flag discrepancies or outdated references with corrective annotations rather than omitting the content entirely.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 3bb960ccef41, Score: 69)\nMUST identify confidential settlement terms or sealed court information in generation requests and substitute publicly available analogous examples while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: af5b206718ea, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers in all generated legal content while preserving document structure and legal reasoning.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal text generation, such as avoiding unauthorized legal advice, ensuring temporal accuracy, and protecting privileged information. However, there are minor overlaps, such as the repeated specification for verifying contract clauses, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses foundational issues like copyright, privilege, and PII, while also tackling specific scenarios like statute of limitations and contract enforceability. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the specificity in some specs could be broadened to enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification for verifying contract clauses (SPEC 8 and SPEC 9) and the similar PII masking requirements (SPEC 13 and SPEC 17). While redundancy in critical areas like PII protection is understandable, the duplication could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness without excessive overlap in other areas.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, with broad applicability across multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow legal scenarios, which could hinder practical implementation in diverse environments.\n\nTOTAL=81",
