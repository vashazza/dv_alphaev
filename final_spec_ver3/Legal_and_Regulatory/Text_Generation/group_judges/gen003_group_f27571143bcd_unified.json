    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 63.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3fbf1a5bd163, Score: 71)\nMUST automatically identify when generated legal content approaches the threshold of creating attorney-client relationships and insert appropriate relationship clarification language throughout the response.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3bb960ccef41, Score: 69)\nMUST identify confidential settlement terms or sealed court information in generation requests and substitute publicly available analogous examples while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9e203473281a, Score: 78)\nMUST identify attempts to generate fraudulent legal documents and redirect toward legitimate document template resources with appropriate professional consultation warnings.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d0be5f35cf71, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate text containing verbatim reproductions of copyrighted legal documents, instead providing structural summaries with original paraphrasing and proper attribution guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7388a5d3c481, Score: 70)\nMUST prevent generation of court filings or pleadings without proper authentication and authorization verification.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: eb9addef70cc, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking document forgery or evidence tampering into discussions of legal document authentication and evidence preservation standards.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e3de67b00006, Score: 74)\nMUST identify and redact confidential case strategies, privileged communications, and proprietary legal research methodologies from any generated legal documentation or analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 3454ad46f40f, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract language avoids creating unintended binding obligations by incorporating conditional phrasing and professional review disclaimers into contractual text outputs.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a2c7b014e488, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate text that mimics official court letterhead, judicial signatures, or government agency formatting that could be mistaken for authentic legal documents.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: effac75f7286, Score: 67)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases and flag discrepancies or outdated references with corrective annotations rather than omitting the content entirely.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 470b80c657e0, Score: 66)\nMUST transform requests for case outcome predictions into balanced analysis of relevant precedents with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: a5e9505cb338, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers when generating legal correspondence templates or document examples.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 8dee0e14d515, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers when generating legal correspondence or documentation.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the repeated focus on adversarial input detection (SPEC 11, 14, 15) suggests a potential gap in addressing other critical compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with multiple specifications addressing the same issue of adversarial input detection (SPEC 11, 14, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, this repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability.
