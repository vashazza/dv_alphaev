    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 71.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 470b80c657e0, Score: 66)\nMUST transform requests for case outcome predictions into balanced analysis of relevant precedents with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d0be5f35cf71, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate text containing verbatim reproductions of copyrighted legal documents, instead providing structural summaries with original paraphrasing and proper attribution guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 37cc015bccef, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate text containing specific statutory interpretations or regulatory guidance without transforming such requests into comparative analysis of multiple authoritative sources with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 55f6d67dbaae, Score: 71)\nMUST detect attempts to generate privileged communications and transform such requests into general explanations of privilege concepts with appropriate confidentiality warnings.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: eb9addef70cc, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking document forgery or evidence tampering into discussions of legal document authentication and evidence preservation standards.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 666d4c22e639, Score: 74)\nMUST verify temporal context for statute of limitations queries and include date-sensitive warnings when legal deadlines may be affected by generated content.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: cd4caee9949e, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated contract clauses align with current statutory requirements and flag potentially unenforceable provisions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: cd4caee9949e, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated contract clauses align with current statutory requirements and flag potentially unenforceable provisions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3454ad46f40f, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract language avoids creating unintended binding obligations by incorporating conditional phrasing and professional review disclaimers into contractual text outputs.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a9ead25245a3, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to generate privileged work product categories and redirect to publicly available legal education materials while preserving user intent for learning.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 470b80c657e0, Score: 66)\nMUST transform requests for case outcome predictions into balanced analysis of relevant precedents with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 463a1bd0e19e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract specific case strategies or litigation tactics and reframe outputs as general legal methodology discussions with ethical boundary clarifications.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
