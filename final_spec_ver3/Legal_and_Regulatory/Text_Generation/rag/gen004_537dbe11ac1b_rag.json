    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal text generation, such as avoiding unauthorized legal advice, ensuring document authenticity, and maintaining confidentiality. However, there is a slight overlap in some areas, such as privileged communications and work product categories, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses foundational issues like copyright, legal advice, and document authenticity, while also considering specific scenarios like statute of limitations and regulatory compliance. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the coverage could be enhanced by including more general rules that apply across multiple legal contexts.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with the repeated focus on contract clauses and privileged communications. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the overlap here could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The specifications could benefit from a more streamlined approach to avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, with broad applicability across various legal scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on privileged communications, which could limit their practicality in broader applications."
