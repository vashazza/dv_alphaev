    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal text generation, such as avoiding unauthorized legal advice, ensuring temporal accuracy, and protecting privileged information. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses foundational issues like copyright, privilege, and statutory compliance while also tackling specific scenarios like document forgery and PII masking. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the coverage could be slightly more comprehensive in addressing emerging legal tech challenges.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications related to contract clauses (Specs 8, 9, and 10) and privileged information (Specs 4 and 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be simplified to enhance their applicability across a wider range of scenarios, avoiding overly specific rules that might limit flexibility."
