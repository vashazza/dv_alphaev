    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal interpretation, confidentiality, and ethical considerations. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of SPEC 4 and SPEC 13, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, from ambiguous legal terminology to unauthorized practice of law. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as human trafficking and evidence tampering. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as confidentiality and unauthorized practice of law, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication, notably SPEC 4 and SPEC 13. Consolidating these could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those concerning forum shopping and venue manipulation, which could limit their applicability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
