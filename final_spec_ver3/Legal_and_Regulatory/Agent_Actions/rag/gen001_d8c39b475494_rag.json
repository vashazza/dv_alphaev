    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as confidentiality, ethical business practices, and jurisdiction-specific requirements. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on avoiding unauthorized practice of law and ensuring accurate legal information. However, there is some duplication (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 13), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, compliance, ethical practices, and jurisdictional issues. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as human trafficking and unauthorized practice of law. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While the group maintains robustness in critical areas, there is some redundancy, particularly with SPEC 4 and SPEC 13, which are identical. This duplication could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, but the presence of identical specs suggests room for optimization.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs, like SPEC 8, could be seen as overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability. Overall, the policy set is practical but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules."
