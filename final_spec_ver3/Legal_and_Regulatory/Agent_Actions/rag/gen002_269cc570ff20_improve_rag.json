    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as confidentiality, ethical business practices, and unauthorized practice of law. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance. However, there is some redundancy that slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, from general principles like confidentiality and compliance to specific issues like human trafficking and unauthorized practice of law. The balance between general rules and specific edge cases is well-maintained, with no significant gaps in critical compliance areas. However, the coverage could be slightly improved by addressing more diverse legal scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to declining requests for legal opinions requiring specialized bar admission. While redundancy in critical areas can be beneficial, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like specific legal opinions, which slightly affects practicality. Overall, the policy set is adaptable to different contexts."
