    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 13 specs, Avg Score: 66.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: d0250f04977c, Score: 74)\nMUST detect ambiguous legal terminology in user queries and seek clarification by presenting multiple jurisdiction-specific definitions before proceeding with contract analysis or regulatory interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d5100cc181d3, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate content that could circumvent court-ordered confidentiality, regulatory disclosure requirements, or statutory reporting obligations even when presented through hypothetical scenarios or academic frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0eef3cd992cd, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and refuse requests to generate content that could facilitate regulatory violations, including securities fraud, tax evasion schemes, or circumvention of compliance requirements.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f10ad4a14acf, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal document examples, replacing specific names, addresses, and case numbers with generic placeholders while preserving document structure.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 2e717338a112, Score: 83)\nMUST detect when contract drafting requests involve terms that could facilitate human trafficking, forced labor, or other criminal enterprises and decline generation while offering ethical business practice alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 784db1d9326f, Score: 84)\nMUST apply content filtering that detects requests for legal document forgery, evidence tampering guidance, or obstruction of justice strategies and redirects to legal ethics resources while refusing harmful completion.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9c7065e36d2a, Score: 78)\nMUST apply contextual rewriting to transform requests for specific legal advice into educational content about relevant legal principles and recommendation to consult qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: b3775e869160, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers before outputting any legal document analysis or case summaries.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: bd21eeb07fe1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when legal document automation requests could enable unauthorized practice of law and transform into guided self-help resources with appropriate complexity limitations and professional consultation triggers.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c8cf91d00e6a, Score: 83)\nMUST verify that API calls to court record systems include proper authentication tokens and comply with jurisdiction-specific access restrictions before executing queries.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ebf3c4ea8440, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case file identifiers, and client names before generating responses containing legal document excerpts or procedural guidance.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7ef493296310, Score: 73)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against current legal databases before including them in responses, replacing outdated references with current versions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: d0250f04977c, Score: 74)\nMUST detect ambiguous legal terminology in user queries and seek clarification by presenting multiple jurisdiction-specific definitions before proceeding with contract analysis or regulatory interpretation.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
