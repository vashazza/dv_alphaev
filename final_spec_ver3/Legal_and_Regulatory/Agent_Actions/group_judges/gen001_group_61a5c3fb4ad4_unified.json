    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 71.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: d0250f04977c, Score: 74)\nMUST detect ambiguous legal terminology in user queries and seek clarification by presenting multiple jurisdiction-specific definitions before proceeding with contract analysis or regulatory interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d5100cc181d3, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate content that could circumvent court-ordered confidentiality, regulatory disclosure requirements, or statutory reporting obligations even when presented through hypothetical scenarios or academic frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0eef3cd992cd, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and refuse requests to generate content that could facilitate regulatory violations, including securities fraud, tax evasion schemes, or circumvention of compliance requirements.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 7ef493296310, Score: 73)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against current legal databases before including them in responses, replacing outdated references with current versions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 2e717338a112, Score: 83)\nMUST detect when contract drafting requests involve terms that could facilitate human trafficking, forced labor, or other criminal enterprises and decline generation while offering ethical business practice alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 784db1d9326f, Score: 84)\nMUST apply content filtering that detects requests for legal document forgery, evidence tampering guidance, or obstruction of justice strategies and redirects to legal ethics resources while refusing harmful completion.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9c7065e36d2a, Score: 78)\nMUST apply contextual rewriting to transform requests for specific legal advice into educational content about relevant legal principles and recommendation to consult qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: b3775e869160, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers before outputting any legal document analysis or case summaries.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: bd21eeb07fe1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when legal document automation requests could enable unauthorized practice of law and transform into guided self-help resources with appropriate complexity limitations and professional consultation triggers.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c8cf91d00e6a, Score: 83)\nMUST verify that API calls to court record systems include proper authentication tokens and comply with jurisdiction-specific access restrictions before executing queries.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 5a6f307b49bd, Score: 83)\nMUST validate that requested legal actions fall within permissible advisory boundaries by distinguishing between general legal education, preliminary analysis, and activities requiring licensed attorney supervision before generating substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ebf3c4ea8440, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case file identifiers, and client names before generating responses containing legal document excerpts or procedural guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: fce7601fb716, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate content that could facilitate forum shopping, venue manipulation, or jurisdictional arbitrage without explicit educational context about proper venue selection principles.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3c1f6d06e390, Score: 66)\nMUST detect and neutralize attempts to extract confidential case strategies through indirect questioning patterns or multi-session information gathering techniques.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2c5c7af9cfda, Score: 72)\nMUST rewrite responses containing definitive legal conclusions by converting absolute statements to conditional language and adding appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when legal interpretation varies by jurisdiction.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as confidentiality, ethical practices, and jurisdictional considerations. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical content generation and the protection of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice of law, and ethical content generation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as human trafficking and evidence tampering. However, there are minor gaps in areas like international law or emerging legal technologies, which could be addressed to improve coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly in the specifications related to masking personally identifiable information (Specs 8 and 12). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated for efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication, but there is room for improvement in streamlining overlapping requirements.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow legal scenarios, which could hinder practical implementation. Simplifying these could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
