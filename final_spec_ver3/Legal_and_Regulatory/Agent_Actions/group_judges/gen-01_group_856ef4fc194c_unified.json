    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 77.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: eb8bd0172d7d, Score: 87)\nMUST recognize and decline requests for legal opinions on matters requiring specialized bar admission or professional liability coverage, redirecting users toward appropriate licensed practitioners.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d5100cc181d3, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate content that could circumvent court-ordered confidentiality, regulatory disclosure requirements, or statutory reporting obligations even when presented through hypothetical scenarios or academic frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d90bfe582b95, Score: 79)\nSHOULD identify when legal research requests involve active litigation matters and recommend consulting with retained counsel rather than providing substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 49450b52b742, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that any integration with court filing systems or legal database APIs includes proper authentication credentials and respects access limitations before executing queries.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: af40abdf6f1d, Score: 72)\nSHOULD validate that regulatory interpretation outputs acknowledge legal uncertainty and evolving jurisprudence, preventing overconfident legal predictions that could mislead users about litigation outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 49450b52b742, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that any integration with court filing systems or legal database APIs includes proper authentication credentials and respects access limitations before executing queries.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 5a6f307b49bd, Score: 83)\nMUST validate that requested legal actions fall within permissible advisory boundaries by distinguishing between general legal education, preliminary analysis, and activities requiring licensed attorney supervision before generating substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 4bdfd45600e2, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide guidance on regulatory evasion strategies, compliance circumvention methods, or legal loophole exploitation even when presented as hypothetical scenarios or academic research.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: fce7601fb716, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate content that could facilitate forum shopping, venue manipulation, or jurisdictional arbitrage without explicit educational context about proper venue selection principles.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 6264df8660ef, Score: 74)\nMUST automatically append jurisdiction disclaimers when generating content about legal procedures, statutes, or regulatory requirements that vary by location.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b8b1e375d427, Score: 81)\nMUST identify potentially privileged attorney-client communications in uploaded documents and seek confirmation of privilege waiver status before performing any content analysis or summarization.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d6f95fe6ac20, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate case law summaries or legal precedent analyses that misrepresent judicial holdings, create false citations, or fabricate court decisions, with mandatory source verification for all legal references.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: bd21eeb07fe1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when legal document automation requests could enable unauthorized practice of law and transform into guided self-help resources with appropriate complexity limitations and professional consultation triggers.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8eb06378bcb8, Score: 72)\nMUST validate that contract clause generation requests align with standard legal practices by checking proposed terms against established precedents before providing substantive drafting assistance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: d6f95fe6ac20, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate case law summaries or legal precedent analyses that misrepresent judicial holdings, create false citations, or fabricate court decisions, with mandatory source verification for all legal references.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
