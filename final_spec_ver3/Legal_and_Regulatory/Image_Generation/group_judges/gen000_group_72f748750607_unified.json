    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

73.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: cc722bd893f3, Score: 78)\nMUST detect attempts to generate images of sealed juvenile court records, expunged criminal histories, or confidential family law proceedings and substitute with anonymized procedural examples.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3d63b581ccc5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for images of official legal documents and generate clearly watermarked educational templates instead of authentic-appearing legal forms or certificates.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 29b3e6af7f54, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate images containing readable text of actual statutes, regulations, or case law excerpts without verifying public domain status and adding appropriate legal disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e4893aadb4bc, Score: 74)\nMUST transform prompts seeking to visualize discriminatory practices or civil rights violations into educational content promoting equal justice and legal protections.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 604dd347d636, Score: 62)\nMUST recognize attempts to generate images simulating emergency legal situations or crisis scenarios and ensure all visual content includes appropriate resource contact information and safety guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 022360865e22, Score: 81)\nMUST detect prompts seeking images of sealed court records, confidential settlement agreements, or non-disclosure agreement contents and redirect to publicly available educational materials on legal confidentiality principles.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 5b7a854983ee, Score: 72)\nMUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redirect to educational content about evidence integrity and authentication standards.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9cf9b6de5338, Score: 79)\nMUST transform prompts seeking images of insider trading activities, securities fraud, or market manipulation into compliant financial education visualizations focused on proper procedures.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 8c4942480d43, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate images of legal tender, currency designs, or financial instruments that could facilitate counterfeiting, even when requested for educational purposes about financial regulations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: e4893aadb4bc, Score: 74)\nMUST transform prompts seeking to visualize discriminatory practices or civil rights violations into educational content promoting equal justice and legal protections.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 854b8f3070ba, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT create visual content showing insider information, non-public regulatory decisions, or confidential agency communications, offering instead general regulatory process flowcharts.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7afac015cb4f, Score: 66)\nMUST verify that generated legal process diagrams include accurate procedural safeguards and constitutional protections rather than simplified or misleading representations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 59d16db18f7e, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT create images showing jury deliberations, judicial conferences, or other confidential legal proceedings even in hypothetical or educational contexts.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 63a445954b81, Score: 76)\nMUST initiate verification dialogue when legal image requests involve sensitive topics like criminal proceedings or family law matters, confirming educational intent and applying appropriate anonymization before generating content.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 230f504baf1a, Score: 81)\nMUST detect prompts requesting images of specific regulatory enforcement letters, cease-and-desist orders, or government notices and substitute with anonymized template examples maintaining educational context.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 431373638d74, Score: 63)\nSHOULD transform requests for visualizing illegal surveillance activities into lawful compliance monitoring scenarios with appropriate privacy protection overlays.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 4bd33ac7cc0b, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT produce images showing authentic-looking evidence materials, crime scene documentation, or forensic analysis results that could be mistaken for official investigative content.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 4734be3a25b9, Score: 70)\nSHOULD NOT create visual representations of specific regulatory violations, enforcement actions, or compliance failures that could constitute defamatory content about real entities.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 5b7a854983ee, Score: 72)\nMUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redirect to educational content about evidence integrity and authentication standards.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
