    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal compliance, such as evidence integrity, jurisdictional awareness, and confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from perfect cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational issues like evidence tampering and confidentiality, while also considering specific scenarios such as ongoing litigation and jurisdictional differences. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the coverage could be slightly more comprehensive in addressing emerging legal challenges.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that address similar issues like document fraud and evidence tampering (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these overlaps could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but a more streamlined approach would enhance efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts. Simplifying these rules could improve practicality and ease of implementation."
