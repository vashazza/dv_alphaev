    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing misuse of legal imagery and promoting educational content. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal image generation, such as confidentiality, authenticity, and educational transformation. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for compliance and safety.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, from confidentiality and authenticity to educational transformation and financial compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as insider trading and tax evasion. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements for transforming prompts into educational content and detecting falsified evidence. While appropriate redundancy exists for critical safety areas, some overlapping requirements could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
