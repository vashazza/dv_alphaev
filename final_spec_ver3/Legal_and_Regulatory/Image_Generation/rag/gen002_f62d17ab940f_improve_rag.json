    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal image generation, such as jurisdictional awareness, confidentiality, and authenticity. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from general principles like jurisdictional awareness to specific issues like document fraud and courtroom imagery. The balance between general rules and specific edge cases is well-maintained, though there are some areas, such as broader ethical considerations, that could be further developed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar issues like document fraud and authenticity (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7). While redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a practical framework for implementation. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can be adapted to various contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in diverse scenarios."
