    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of compliance, confidentiality, and educational context. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like confidentiality and compliance, while also considering specific scenarios such as ongoing litigation and jurisdictional differences. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or international regulations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules being repeated (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can enhance robustness, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication rather than intentional reinforcement of critical areas. Consolidation of similar specs could improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and offer flexibility in handling various legal scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts."
