    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in image generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, evidence integrity, and financial compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as insider trading and discriminatory practices. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging legal issues in digital content creation.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as repeated specifications for transforming discriminatory practice prompts. Consolidating these could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming sensitive requests into educational content. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
