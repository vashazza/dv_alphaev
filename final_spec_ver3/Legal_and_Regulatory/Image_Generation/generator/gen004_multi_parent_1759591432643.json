Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing misuse of legal imagery and promoting educational content. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal image generation, such as confidentiality, authenticity, and educational transformation. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for compliance and safety.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, from confidentiality and authenticity to educational transformation and financial compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as insider trading and tax evasion. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements for transforming prompts into educational content and detecting falsified evidence. While appropriate redundancy exists for critical safety areas, some overlapping requirements could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks associated with image gener...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, balancing general princ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that addresses various...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from general principles like jurisd...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including evidence tampering, juris...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on lega...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including confidentiality, authenti...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for generating images of attorney signatures, notary stamps, or certification marks and substitute ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect prompts requesting images of specific regulatory enforcement letters, cease-and-desist orders, or government...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from evidence integrity to jurisdic...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing misuse of legal imagery and promoting educational content.
