  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal image generation, such as jurisdictional awareness, confidentiality, and authenticity. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from general principles like jurisdictional awareness to specific issues like document fraud and courtroom imagery. The balance between general rules and specific edge cases is well-maintained, though there are some areas, such as broader ethical considerations, that could be further developed.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar issues like document fraud and authenticity (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7). While redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a practical framework for implementation. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can be adapted to various contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in diverse scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks associated with image gener...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with legal and regulatory image generation, inclu...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for generating images of attorney signatures, notary stamps, or certification marks and substitute ...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect prompts requesting images of specific regulatory enforcement letters, cease-and-desist orders, or government...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks associated with image gener...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from general principles like jurisd...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, evidence in...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect attempts to generate images of sealed juvenile court records, expunged criminal histories, or confidential f...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for images of official legal documents and generate clearly watermarked educational templates inste...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including evidence tampering, juris...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redi...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in image generation.
