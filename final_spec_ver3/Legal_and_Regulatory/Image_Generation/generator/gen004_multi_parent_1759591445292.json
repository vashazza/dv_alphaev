Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in image generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting inappropriate requests to educational content and ensuring jurisdictional awareness. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 18), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from evidence integrity to jurisdictional awareness and privacy protection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling requests for confidential legal proceedings and insider information. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific guidance on handling emerging technologies or digital rights management..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting inappropriate requests to educational content and ensuring jurisdictional awareness. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 18), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from evidence integrity to jurisdictional awareness and privacy protection. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling requests for confidential legal proceedings and insider information. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific guidance on handling emerging technologies or digital rights management.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as preventing the generation of misleading legal content, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 18). Consolidating these could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests and ensuring compliance with legal standards. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives and clarifying dialogues. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts, such as the detailed handling of specific legal scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 72) MUST NOT generate imagery depicting specific jurisdictional court procedures, local filing requireme...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case ...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate images depicting authentic judicial proceedings, courtroom scenes with identifiabl...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
