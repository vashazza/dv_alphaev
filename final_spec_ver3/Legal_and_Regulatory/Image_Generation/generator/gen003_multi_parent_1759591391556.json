Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of compliance, confidentiality, and educational context. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like confidentiality and compliance, while also considering specific scenarios such as ongoing litigation and jurisdictional differences. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or international regulations..

They complement each other by covering different facets of compliance, confidentiality, and educational context. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like confidentiality and compliance, while also considering specific scenarios such as ongoing litigation and jurisdictional differences. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or international regulations.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules being repeated (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can enhance robustness, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication rather than intentional reinforcement of critical areas. Consolidation of similar specs could improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and offer flexibility in handling various legal scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) MUST NOT create visual content showing insider information, non-public regulatory decisions, or conf...\n  - [2] (Score: 72) MUST NOT generate imagery depicting specific jurisdictional court procedures, local filing requireme...\n  - [3] (Score: 79) MUST identify prompts seeking visual representations of privileged communications or confidential le...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
