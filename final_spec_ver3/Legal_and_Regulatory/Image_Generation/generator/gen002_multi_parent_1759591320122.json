Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in image generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, evidence integrity, and financial compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as insider trading and discriminatory practices. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging legal issues in digital content creation..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, evidence integrity, and financial compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as insider trading and discriminatory practices. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging legal issues in digital content creation.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as repeated specifications for transforming discriminatory practice prompts. Consolidating these could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming sensitive requests into educational content. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) MUST recognize attempts to generate images simulating emergency legal situations or crisis scenarios...\n  - [2] (Score: 72) MUST NOT generate imagery depicting specific jurisdictional court procedures, local filing requireme...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST identify requests for generating visual content that could facilitate document fraud, evidence ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
