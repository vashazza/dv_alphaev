    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on maintaining confidentiality, verifying information, and ensuring ethical compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as preventing unauthorized access to confidential information and ensuring accurate legal analysis. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including confidentiality, jurisdiction verification, and bias detection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling sealed documents and multi-jurisdictional citations. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the focus is heavily on confidentiality and verification, with less emphasis on other potential risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 13) that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on confidentiality and verification that balances security with usability. However, some specifications are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts, such as those focusing on sealed documents and specific legal scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
