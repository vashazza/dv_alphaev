    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

processing contract analysis requests, instead providing factual observations and directing users to consult qualified legal counsel for interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8224e024a55e, Score: 85)\nMUST preserve judicial integrity by refusing to generate speculative case outcome predictions or settlement value estimates based on incomplete litigation materials or partial discovery documents.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f7eb31074a1c, Score: 81)\nMUST verify that case law precedents cited in legal research outputs remain good law by checking for subsequent appeals, reversals, or distinguishing decisions before presenting them as binding authority.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: ab6690120f48, Score: 84)\nMUST validate professional licensing status by cross-checking attorney bar numbers and regulatory practitioner credentials against current licensing databases before processing professional service agreements.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4da9b9a7b138, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by rewriting legal advice requests into educational summaries with appropriate disclaimers directing users to qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID:

practitioner credentials against current licensing databases before processing professional service agreements.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 15c56b28b1cb, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT combine confidential information

interpretation or admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 8224e024a55e, Score: 85)\nMUST preserve judicial integrity by refusing to generate speculative case outcome predictions or settlement value estimates

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on maintaining legal integrity, confidentiality, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal information processing, such as avoiding unauthorized practice of law, preserving judicial integrity, and ensuring confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including confidentiality, licensing verification, and the integrity of legal advice. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling sealed documents and verifying statutory citations. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the presence of repeated specifications suggests a potential for broader coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications on validating professional licensing status and preserving judicial integrity. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on maintaining legal compliance and confidentiality. They are designed to be implementable in real-world scenarios, balancing security with usability. However, the repetition of certain specifications and the presence of overly specific rules in some cases slightly reduce their practicality and adaptability.\n\nTOTAL=82",
