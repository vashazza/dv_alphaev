    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

80.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ef0ad82938ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate legal advice or specific recommendations when processing contract analysis requests, instead providing factual observations and directing users to consult qualified legal counsel for interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8224e024a55e, Score:

documents.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f7eb31074a1c, Score: 81)\nMUST verify that case law precedents cited in legal research outputs remain good law by checking for subsequent appeals, reversals, or distinguishing decisions before presenting them as binding authority.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: ab6690120f48, Score: 84)\nMUST validate professional licensing status by cross-checking attorney bar numbers and regulatory practitioner credentials against current licensing databases before processing professional service agreements.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4da9b9a7b138, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by rewriting legal advice requests into educational summaries with appropriate disclaimers directing users to qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID:

processing any legal document analysis requests.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source databases and flag inconsistencies with jurisdiction-specific disclaimers when synthesizing compliance guidance across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify

confidential information from multiple client matters or regulatory proceedings when generating comparative legal analyses, maintaining strict information segregation protocols.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: acfb81728c7a, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation materials, instead offering general informational context and suggesting consultation with qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source databases and flag inconsistencies with jurisdiction-specific disclaimers when synthesizing compliance guidance across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8a8e3dc6b57b, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve evidentiary

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on maintaining legal integrity, ensuring compliance, and avoiding unauthorized practice of law. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal information processing, such as preserving judicial integrity, verifying professional credentials, and maintaining evidentiary integrity. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, and multi-jurisdictional compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as preserving evidentiary integrity and verifying licensing status. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies and digital privacy concerns, which could enhance the coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., multi-jurisdictional verification and professional licensing validation). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like verifying credentials and maintaining confidentiality. They balance security with usability by providing disclaimers and directing users to qualified counsel.
