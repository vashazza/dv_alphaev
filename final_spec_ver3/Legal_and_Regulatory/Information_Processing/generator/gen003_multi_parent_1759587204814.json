Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on legal and regulatory compliance. They address various aspects of information processing, such as confidentiality, jurisdictional accuracy, and ethical boundaries. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, jurisdictional verification, and ethical compliance. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling sealed documents and multi-jurisdictional citations. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or digital evidence handling..

They address various aspects of information processing, such as confidentiality, jurisdictional accuracy, and ethical boundaries. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, jurisdictional verification, and ethical compliance. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling sealed documents and multi-jurisdictional citations. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or digital evidence handling.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 13) that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined for efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source da...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation m...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
