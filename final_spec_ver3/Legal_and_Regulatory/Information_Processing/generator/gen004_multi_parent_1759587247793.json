Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on maintaining legal integrity and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal information processing, such as avoiding unauthorized practice of law, preserving confidentiality, and ensuring the accuracy of legal references. However, there is some repetition, particularly in the validation of professional licensing status, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including confidentiality, licensing verification, and the integrity of legal advice. It balances general principles with specific protections, such as handling sealed documents and verifying statutory citations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling international legal documents or cross-jurisdictional issues..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal information processing, such as avoiding unauthorized practice of law, preserving confidentiality, and ensuring the accuracy of legal references. However, there is some repetition, particularly in the validation of professional licensing status, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including confidentiality, licensing verification, and the integrity of legal advice. It balances general principles with specific protections, such as handling sealed documents and verifying statutory citations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling international legal documents or cross-jurisdictional issues.\n• Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification regarding the validation of professional licensing status (SPECs 4, 7, 12, 13). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here is excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a practical framework for implementation. They balance security with usability by focusing on broadly applicable rules, such as avoiding unauthorized legal practice and maintaining confidentiality. However, the repetition of certain specifications and the lack of flexibility for handling diverse legal contexts slightly reduce practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST NOT combine confidential information from multiple client matters or regulatory proceedings whe...\n  - [2] (Score: 65) SHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST NOT synthesize legal conclusions by combining partial information from multiple unverified sour...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
