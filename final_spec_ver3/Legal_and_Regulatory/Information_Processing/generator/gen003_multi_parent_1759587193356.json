Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as avoiding unauthorized practice of law, preserving judicial integrity, and maintaining evidentiary integrity. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as verifying professional credentials and ensuring the accuracy of legal citations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including professional responsibility, confidentiality, and multi-jurisdictional issues. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as detecting bias in legal precedent analysis and preserving evidentiary chain of custody.

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as avoiding unauthorized practice of law, preserving judicial integrity, and maintaining evidentiary integrity. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as verifying professional credentials and ensuring the accuracy of legal citations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including professional responsibility, confidentiality, and multi-jurisdictional issues. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as detecting bias in legal precedent analysis and preserving evidentiary chain of custody. While the coverage is comprehensive, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies and digital privacy concerns.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18, SPEC 5 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness without excessive overlap, but there is room for improvement in streamlining the specifications.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as multi-jurisdictional compliance and professional licensing verification. However, some specifications are overly specific and may not be easily implementable in all scenarios, such as detecting bias in legal precedent analysis. Overall, the policy set is practical but could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 64) SHOULD detect bias in legal precedent analysis and provide balanced perspective acknowledgments when...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) SHOULD detect bias in legal precedent selection by ensuring representation across diverse judicial p...\n  - [3] (Score: 65) SHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
