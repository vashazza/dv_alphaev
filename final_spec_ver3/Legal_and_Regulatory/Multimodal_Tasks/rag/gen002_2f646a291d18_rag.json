    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of multimodal legal and regulatory tasks. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal compliance, such as confidentiality, conflict of interest, and data protection. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like cross-modal verification and content consistency, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal tasks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas such as confidentiality, data protection, and conflict of interest. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential legal scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some redundancy in specifications related to cross-modal verification and content consistency, it is generally appropriate for ensuring robustness in critical safety areas. However, some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap and improve efficiency without compromising safety.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, a few specifications are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in broader scenarios."
