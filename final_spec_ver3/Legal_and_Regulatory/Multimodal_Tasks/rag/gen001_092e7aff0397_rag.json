    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for handling legal and regulatory tasks. They address various aspects of evidence handling, privacy, and legal interpretation, with logical connections between requirements. However, there is some redundancy that slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including evidence authenticity, privacy, and conflict of interest. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with multiple specifications addressing similar issues like privilege detection (e.g., SPEC 6, 7, and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability and implementation in diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
