    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal legal and regulatory tasks, such as cross-modal verification, confidentiality, and conflict of interest. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as detecting inconsistencies and ensuring data protection, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the legal and regulatory domain, including confidentiality, data protection, and conflict of interest. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling pro se litigants and jurisdiction-aware filtering. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure no critical compliance areas are overlooked.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly in areas like cross-modal verification and data protection. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, some overlapping requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. The specifications are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictions and user types. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
