    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal legal content. They address various aspects of legal content processing, such as authenticity verification, privilege protection, and emotional manipulation detection. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated emphasis on content-aware filtering, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including authenticity, privilege, emotional manipulation, and jurisdictional accuracy. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling emerging technologies or novel legal scenarios, which could enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification on content-aware filtering (Specs 13, 15, and 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, this repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, but further consolidation could enhance robustness without waste.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on emotional distress indicators, which could limit their applicability. Streamlining these rules could improve practicality."
