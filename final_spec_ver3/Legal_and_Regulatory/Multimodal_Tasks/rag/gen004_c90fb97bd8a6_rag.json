    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of handling multimodal legal content, such as verifying authenticity, protecting privileged information, and ensuring jurisdictional accuracy. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on preventing unauthorized disclosures and ensuring accurate legal analysis. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including authenticity verification, privilege protection, and emotional manipulation detection. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling emergency legal situations and discriminatory language. While comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification on content-aware filtering (SPEC 13, 15, 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated. The group maintains robustness, but efficiency could be improved by reducing unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring accurate legal analysis. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those addressing narrow scenarios like emotional distress indicators, which could limit adaptability across different contexts."
