    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

57.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 1e789afd305f, Score: 65)\nMUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesizing multimodal case materials.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 4d750d02b84e, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file identifiers, and personal addresses when present across text, image, or audio inputs before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 8a93f3ff68d3, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT create definitive case outcome predictions when processing multimodal trial materials including courtroom footage, exhibit photos, and hearing transcripts.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 187ea55bbb19, Score: 69)\nSHOULD transform discriminatory language or biased characterizations found in legal documents, recordings, or videos into neutral descriptive terms while maintaining evidentiary integrity for civil rights or employment law analysis.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: de489fe6d83d, Score: 77)\nMUST verify document authenticity markers including digital signatures, court seals, and official timestamps before analyzing legal documents, declining analysis of potentially altered or fabricated materials.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a03f1192de3f, Score: 71)\nMUST detect and neutralize social engineering attempts embedded within legal consultation requests that use emotional manipulation across multiple modalities to extract sensitive case information or bypass professional boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a839aa009541, Score: 69)\nMUST include professional liability disclaimers when synthesizing multimodal regulatory guidance that could influence business compliance decisions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 5b08d99795c3, Score: 69)\nMUST validate jurisdictional accuracy when synthesizing multimodal legal content from different geographic regions or court systems.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 7dabf423e5ed, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT create derivative legal works that could infringe copyright or violate licensing restrictions on legal databases and resources.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 432ce240444b, Score: 70)\nMUST apply content-aware filtering that recognizes legal document types across modalities and adjusts processing restrictions based on document classification and sensitivity.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 432ce240444b, Score: 70)\nMUST apply content-aware filtering that recognizes legal document types across modalities and adjusts processing restrictions based on document classification and sensitivity.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 89aae223088e, Score: 75)\nMUST detect and preserve attorney-client privilege markers embedded in multimodal communications, preventing inadvertent disclosure of protected information.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 432ce240444b, Score: 70)\nMUST apply content-aware filtering that recognizes legal document types across modalities and adjusts processing restrictions based on document classification and sensitivity.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 462e2338d0a0, Score: N/A)\nMUST seek explicit clarification when processing ambiguous jurisdictional references that could apply to multiple legal systems, requesting specific geographic and temporal context before providing any substantive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 48a5e03d5539, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, financial account details, and personal identifiers when they appear across text, image, or audio inputs during regulatory compliance discussions.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 187ea55bbb19, Score:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in multimodal tasks. They complement each other by covering different facets such as privacy, authenticity, and bias. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, document authenticity, jurisdictional accuracy, and bias mitigation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as deepfake detection and social engineering attempts. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or international compliance standards.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., content-aware filtering and PII masking). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts.
