    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 79.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 0b42e7241370, Score: 77)\nMUST detect court seal authenticity and jurisdiction validity when processing visual court documents, declining analysis of potentially forged or misfiled materials with guidance toward official verification channels.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: c2537e9bf495, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT produce consolidated legal summaries when multimodal evidence sources demonstrate conflicting credibility levels, instead presenting stratified analysis that acknowledges evidentiary hierarchy and reliability concerns.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 0dcd08188f68, Score: 75)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest when multimodal submissions contain identifying information from multiple parties, redirecting to conflict-checking resources instead of proceeding with substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 63f35f4f8076, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney identifications, social security numbers, and financial account details across all input modalities before processing any legal content.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a102b251cec3, Score: 75)\nMUST pause content generation when biometric data, voice prints, or facial recognition markers in multimodal inputs could enable identity theft or privacy violations, requesting user confirmation of consent and legitimate purpose.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: cce9778fb397, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law when processing multimodal legal content for non-licensed users, instead rewriting analysis as educational information with appropriate disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b35b42ba6940, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney names, client identifiers, case numbers, and sensitive financial data when processing multimodal legal documents before generating consolidated responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 80b4b1cce993, Score: 74)\nSHOULD initiate dialogue to clarify scope limitations when multimodal legal requests could inadvertently create attorney-client relationships or professional liability exposure.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 2e20a0a28679, Score: 88)\nMUST detect and decline analysis of sealed juvenile records, expunged criminal files, or confidential family court materials regardless of input format or claimed authorization.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c5ea628d7618, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses when audio transcriptions of privileged communications are detected, instead requesting confirmation of public record status or appropriate authorization.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2233e7b5d7cd, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between visual documents and their accompanying text descriptions, requesting clarification before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2233e7b5d7cd, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between visual documents and their accompanying text descriptions, requesting clarification before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: bd8d409e86e2, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal documents and accompanying audio testimony without explicit acknowledgment of discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: c5ea628d7618, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses when audio transcriptions of privileged communications are detected, instead requesting confirmation of public record status or appropriate authorization.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 63f35f4f8076, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney identifications, social security numbers, and financial account details across all input modalities before processing any legal content.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on the detection and handling of sensitive legal information across multimodal inputs. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal document processing, such as authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including authenticity verification, privacy protection, and conflict of interest detection. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling juvenile records and privileged communications. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential legal scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 13; SPEC 14 and 15; SPEC 6 and 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing mechanisms for user confirmation and clarification. However, some rules are overly specific, which might limit their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
