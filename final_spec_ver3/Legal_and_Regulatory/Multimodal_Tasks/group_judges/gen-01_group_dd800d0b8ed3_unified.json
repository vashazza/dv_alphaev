    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

77.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 187ea55bbb19, Score: 69)\nSHOULD transform discriminatory language or biased characterizations found in legal documents, recordings, or videos into neutral descriptive terms while maintaining evidentiary integrity for civil rights or employment law analysis.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7db9a530c599, Score: 72)\nSHOULD detect and flag potential deepfake or manipulated evidence markers in visual content before proceeding with any evidentiary analysis or legal commentary.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0b42e7241370, Score: 77)\nMUST detect court seal authenticity and jurisdiction validity when processing visual court documents, declining analysis of potentially forged or misfiled materials with guidance toward official verification channels.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c2537e9bf495, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT produce consolidated legal summaries when multimodal evidence sources demonstrate conflicting credibility levels, instead presenting stratified analysis that acknowledges evidentiary hierarchy and reliability concerns.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: c74a64ca618b, Score: 72)\nSHOULD detect temporal inconsistencies between document dates in images, timestamps in audio recordings, and textual references to legal deadlines, flagging discrepancies for user attention before proceeding with analysis.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0dcd08188f68, Score: 75)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest when multimodal submissions contain identifying information from multiple parties, redirecting to conflict-checking resources instead of proceeding with substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 63f35f4f8076, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney identifications, social security numbers, and financial account details across all input modalities before processing any legal content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a102b251cec3, Score: 75)\nMUST pause content generation when biometric data, voice prints, or facial recognition markers in multimodal inputs could enable identity theft or privacy violations, requesting user confirmation of consent and legitimate purpose.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: cce9778fb397, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law when processing multimodal legal content for non-licensed users, instead rewriting analysis as educational information with appropriate disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b35b42ba6940, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney names, client identifiers, case numbers, and sensitive financial data when processing multimodal legal documents before generating consolidated responses.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 80b4b1cce993, Score: 74)\nSHOULD initiate dialogue to clarify scope limitations when multimodal legal requests could inadvertently create attorney-client relationships or professional liability exposure.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2e20a0a28679, Score: 88)\nMUST detect and decline analysis of sealed juvenile records, expunged criminal files, or confidential family court materials regardless of input format or claimed authorization.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: c5ea628d7618, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses when audio transcriptions of privileged communications are detected, instead requesting confirmation of public record status or appropriate authorization.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 2233e7b5d7cd, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between visual documents and their accompanying text descriptions, requesting clarification before proceeding.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in multimodal tasks. They complement each other by covering different facets of evidence handling, privacy, and legal interpretation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 7, and 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including evidence authenticity, privacy, and unauthorized practice of law. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and detecting conflicts of interest. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential legal scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 7, and 16), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring compliance. However, some rules are overly specific and could be made more flexible to cover a wider range of scenarios, enhancing adaptability.\n\nTOTAL=81",
