  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in multimodal tasks. They complement each other by covering different facets of evidence handling, privacy, and legal interpretation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 7, and 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including evidence authenticity, privacy, and unauthorized practice of law. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and detecting conflicts of interest. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential legal scenarios.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 7, and 16), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring compliance. However, some rules are overly specific and could be made more flexible to cover a wider range of scenarios, enhancing adaptability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
