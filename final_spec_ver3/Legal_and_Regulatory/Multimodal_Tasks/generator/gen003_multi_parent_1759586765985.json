Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal legal and regulatory tasks, such as confidentiality, consistency, and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-modal verification and the handling of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the legal and regulatory domain, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses confidentiality, data protection, and cross-modal inconsistencies, which are critical compliance areas. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel legal challenges, which could be improved with more specific rules..

They address various aspects of multimodal legal and regulatory tasks, such as confidentiality, consistency, and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-modal verification and the handling of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the legal and regulatory domain, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses confidentiality, data protection, and cross-modal inconsistencies, which are critical compliance areas. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel legal challenges, which could be improved with more specific rules.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as PII masking and cross-modal verification, there are instances of overlapping requirements that could be consolidated. For example, multiple specs address cross-modal inconsistencies and PII masking, which could be streamlined to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as jurisdiction-aware filtering and handling pro se litigants. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks...\n  - [2] (Score: 83) MUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between ...\n  - [3] (Score: 73) MUST prompt for jurisdiction specification when multimodal regulatory content spans multiple legal s...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
