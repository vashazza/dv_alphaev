Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of multimodal legal and regulatory tasks. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal compliance, such as confidentiality, conflict of interest, and data protection. However, there are minor overlaps in areas like cross-modal verification and content consistency, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal tasks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas such as confidentiality, data protection, and conflict of interest. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential legal scenarios.. Redundancy: While there is some redundancy in specifications related to cross-modal verification and content consistency, it is generally appropriate for ensuring robustness in critical safety areas. However, some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap and improve efficiency without compromising safety.. Practicality: The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, a few specifications are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ensuring ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in the legal and regulatory domain, including conte...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal d...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesiz...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal tasks, balancin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between visual documents and...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): SHOULD apply graduated disclosure controls for sensitive legal information by detecting confidentiality levels across mo...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for handling legal and...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including evidence authent...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): SHOULD transform discriminatory language or biased characterizations found in legal documents, recordings, or videos int...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): SHOULD detect and flag potential deepfake or manipulated evidence markers in visual content before proceeding with any e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including privilege protect...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect and preserve attorney-client privilege markers embedded in multimodal communications, preventing inadvertent...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT produce consolidated legal summaries when multimodal evidence sources demonstrate conflicting credibility level...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling mu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including privacy,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal d...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesiz...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling mu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including authenti...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal d...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesiz...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of multimodal legal and regulatory tasks.
