Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ensuring the integrity and accuracy of multimodal legal content processing. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal content verification, confidentiality, and ethical considerations. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts in how content filtering and analysis are approached, which slightly detracts from full cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in the legal and regulatory domain, including content verification, confidentiality, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling privileged communications and emergency situations. However, there are some gaps in addressing other potential risks, such as data privacy beyond attorney-client privilege..

They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal content verification, confidentiality, and ethical considerations. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts in how content filtering and analysis are approached, which slightly detracts from full cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in the legal and regulatory domain, including content verification, confidentiality, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling privileged communications and emergency situations. However, there are some gaps in addressing other potential risks, such as data privacy beyond attorney-client privilege.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification on content-aware filtering (SPEC 13, 15, 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling complex multimodal legal content. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their adaptability across different contexts and scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 64) SHOULD apply enhanced content filtering when multimodal inputs contain emotional distress indicators...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST apply enhanced scrutiny filtering to multimodal inputs claiming emergency legal situations, ver...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law when processing multi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
