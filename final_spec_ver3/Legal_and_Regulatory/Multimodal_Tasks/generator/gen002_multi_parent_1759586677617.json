Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal legal content. They address various aspects of legal content processing, such as authenticity verification, privilege protection, and emotional manipulation detection. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated emphasis on content-aware filtering, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including authenticity, privilege, emotional manipulation, and jurisdictional accuracy. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling emerging technologies or novel legal scenarios, which could enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification on content-aware filtering (Specs 13, 15, and 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, this repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, but further consolidation could enhance robustness without waste.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on emotional distress indicators, which could limit their applicability. Streamlining these rules could improve practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ensuring ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in the legal and regulatory domain, including conte...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal d...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesiz...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal tasks, balancin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between visual documents and...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): SHOULD apply graduated disclosure controls for sensitive legal information by detecting confidentiality levels across mo...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for handling legal and...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including evidence authent...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): SHOULD transform discriminatory language or biased characterizations found in legal documents, recordings, or videos int...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 72): SHOULD detect and flag potential deepfake or manipulated evidence markers in visual content before proceeding with any e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including privilege protect...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect and preserve attorney-client privilege markers embedded in multimodal communications, preventing inadvertent...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT produce consolidated legal summaries when multimodal evidence sources demonstrate conflicting credibility level...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling mu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including privacy,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal d...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesiz...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling mu...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including authenti...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal d...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesiz...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal legal content.
