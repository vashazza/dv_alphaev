    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of legal document classification, such as ethical considerations, jurisdiction-specific terminology, and the need for factual completeness. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical practices and the avoidance of unauthorized legal advice. However, there is some duplication, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including ethical violations, conflicts of interest, and jurisdiction-specific terminology. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling defamatory content and unauthorized practice of law. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more foundational rules to ensure a more balanced mix of general and specific protections.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements for detecting conflicts of interest and unauthorized practice of law. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring ethical compliance. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring iterative dialogue for cross-border matters, which could limit flexibility and adaptability in different contexts."
