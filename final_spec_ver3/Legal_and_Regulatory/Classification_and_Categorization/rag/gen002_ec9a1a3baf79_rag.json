    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for legal and regulatory classification tasks. They address various aspects of legal document handling, such as evidentiary standards, conflict of interest detection, and cross-border legal matters. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 11 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including evidentiary standards, ethical considerations, and jurisdictional complexities. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and ethical violations. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (SPEC 6 and SPEC 7, SPEC 11 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
