    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal document classification and compliance. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory requirements, such as confidentiality, accuracy, and jurisdictional considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 8, and 16) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including confidentiality, jurisdictional complexities, and document accuracy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sealed records and cross-border matters. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or digital evidence.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 8, and 16) that could be consolidated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas like confidentiality, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as validating citations and masking personal information. However, some rules are overly specific and could be more flexible to accommodate various legal contexts. The repeated specifications also suggest a need for more adaptable and broadly applicable rules."
