    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on the classification and categorization of legal documents. They address various aspects such as confidentiality, accuracy, and jurisdictional considerations. However, there are some redundancies, particularly with the repeated specification about not classifying legal advice as general information, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of issues relevant to legal document classification, including confidentiality, accuracy, jurisdictional complexity, and conflict of interest. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some areas, such as the handling of emerging legal technologies or digital evidence, could be more explicitly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification about not classifying legal advice as general information, which appears multiple times. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, this repetition seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring accuracy. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring iterative dialogue for cross-border matters, which may be challenging to implement consistently."
