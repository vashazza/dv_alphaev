    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on the classification and categorization of legal documents. There are logical connections between requirements, such as handling sensitive information and ensuring accuracy in legal contexts. However, there is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory classification issues, including confidentiality, accuracy, jurisdictional complexities, and conflict of interest. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of rules addressing emerging legal technologies or digital evidence.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification regarding the classification of legal advice content. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world legal classification scenarios. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring iterative dialogue for cross-border matters, which may not be practical in all contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
