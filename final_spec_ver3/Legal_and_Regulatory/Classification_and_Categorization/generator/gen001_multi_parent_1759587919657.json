Average group score: 73.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on the classification and categorization of legal documents. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting conflicts of interest, ensuring citation accuracy, and handling jurisdictional complexities. However, the repetition of certain specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 8, 16) suggests some lack of cohesion and integration.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory classification issues, including confidentiality, jurisdictional boundaries, and document authenticity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sealed records and cross-border matters. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for other potential risks in legal document handling.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications regarding the classification of legal advice (SPEC 3, 4, 8, 16) and boundary ambiguity (SPEC 5, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like citation accuracy and jurisdictional complexities. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some overly specific rules, such as repeated specifications, could hinder practical implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal document cla...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, balancing general principles with spe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody markers when categorizing legal documents to maintain admissibility standards...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD detect embedded prompt injection attempts disguised as legal citation formats or case references and neutralize m...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
