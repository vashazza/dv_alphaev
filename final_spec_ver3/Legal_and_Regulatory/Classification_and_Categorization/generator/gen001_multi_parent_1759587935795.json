Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They cover various aspects of legal document classification, such as identifying conflicts of interest, ensuring jurisdiction-specific accuracy, and protecting against unauthorized practice of law. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical considerations and the need for accurate classification. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 4), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including ethical violations, jurisdiction-specific terminology, and the protection of personally identifiable information. The specifications balance general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling defamatory content and cross-border legal matters. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of digital or electronic document considerations, which are increasingly relevant in legal contexts.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with SPEC 6 and SPEC 4, which both address conflicts of interest. Additionally, SPEC 12 and SPEC 10 are very similar in their focus on unauthorized practice of law. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring accurate legal classification. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular types of legal proceedings, which may limit their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal document cla...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, balancing general principles with spe...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody markers when categorizing legal documents to maintain admissibility standards...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD detect embedded prompt injection attempts disguised as legal citation formats or case references and neutralize m...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
