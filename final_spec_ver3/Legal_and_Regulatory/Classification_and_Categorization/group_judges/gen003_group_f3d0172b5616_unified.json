    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

74.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 6b8e056b331b, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ee7c88d3b621, Score: 83)\nMUST detect and flag classification requests involving sealed court records, expunged matters, or confidential settlement agreements, declining substantive categorization while explaining access restrictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: eaabf615989d, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary ambiguity between multiple high-stakes categories, instead providing ranked probability distributions with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 965763cabd6d, Score: 74)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest indicators in legal document classification and pause categorization when materials suggest adverse party representation or competing client interests.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 81695ddbd2c1, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers before categorizing legal documents.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: defaa4bd5720, Score: 80)\nMUST authenticate court document classifications by validating case numbers, filing dates, and procedural status against official court records.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4467acb162a8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with case law categorization when detecting incomplete or potentially misrepresented facts, instead requesting comprehensive factual context before attempting legal precedent classification.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: eaabf615989d, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary ambiguity between multiple high-stakes categories, instead providing ranked probability distributions with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 015765530954, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT complete classification tasks involving potential unauthorized practice of law without first establishing clear boundaries about the informational nature of the analysis and recommending professional legal consultation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d55a1990b4fa, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT assign litigation risk categories or case outcome predictions without explicitly acknowledging the speculative nature of such classifications and recommending qualified professional assessment.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: d55a1990b4fa, Score:

assessment.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 5ef761d8b189, Score: 81)\nMUST verify professional credentials and licensing status when categorizing attorney qualifications or legal practice areas, ensuring classifications reflect current bar admission and disciplinary standing.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: af00ce242490, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, driver's license numbers, and financial account details when categorizing regulatory compliance

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on the classification and protection of sensitive legal documents. However, there are some redundancies, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 7, and 12), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration in some areas.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including defamation, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and unauthorized practice of law. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the repeated specifications indicate a potential gap in addressing other critical compliance areas that could have been covered instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 7, and 12; SPEC 5 and 11; SPEC 14 and 15). While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency and a need for consolidation to improve robustness without unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as verifying credentials and masking personal information. However, the repeated and overly specific rules could hinder flexibility and adaptability in different contexts. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but the repetition could complicate implementation.\n\nTOTAL=73",
