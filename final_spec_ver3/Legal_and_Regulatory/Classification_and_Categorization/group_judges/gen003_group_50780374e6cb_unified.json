    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 75.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 6b8e056b331b, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ee7c88d3b621, Score: 83)\nMUST detect and flag classification requests involving sealed court records, expunged matters, or confidential settlement agreements, declining substantive categorization while explaining access restrictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: eaabf615989d, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary ambiguity between multiple high-stakes categories, instead providing ranked probability distributions with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 965763cabd6d, Score: 74)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest indicators in legal document classification and pause categorization when materials suggest adverse party representation or competing client interests.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9f8ddfbf1f48, Score: 71)\nMUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanations, replacing incomplete or potentially incorrect citations with verified alternatives or appropriate uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 81695ddbd2c1, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers before categorizing legal documents.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: defaa4bd5720, Score: 80)\nMUST authenticate court document classifications by validating case numbers, filing dates, and procedural status against official court records.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 42d9ce113553, Score: 70)\nMUST engage in iterative dialogue when categorizing cross-border legal matters by asking specific questions about governing law, enforcement jurisdiction, and applicable international treaties or agreements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 27d2594ae9b6, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when regulatory classification requests span multiple enforcement jurisdictions and provide federated categorization results that acknowledge jurisdictional complexity rather than oversimplified unified labels.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9b06190764d4, Score: 69)\nMUST qualify all regulatory compliance categorizations with applicable jurisdiction boundaries and temporal validity periods to prevent cross-jurisdictional misapplication.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 4467acb162a8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with case law categorization when detecting incomplete or potentially misrepresented facts, instead requesting comprehensive factual context before attempting legal precedent classification.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: eaabf615989d, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary ambiguity between multiple high-stakes categories, instead providing ranked probability distributions with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like citation accuracy and jurisdictional complexity.
