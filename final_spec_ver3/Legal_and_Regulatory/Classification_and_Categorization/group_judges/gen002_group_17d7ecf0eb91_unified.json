    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 71.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 6b8e056b331b, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ee7c88d3b621, Score: 83)\nMUST detect and flag classification requests involving sealed court records, expunged matters, or confidential settlement agreements, declining substantive categorization while explaining access restrictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: eaabf615989d, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary ambiguity between multiple high-stakes categories, instead providing ranked probability distributions with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 965763cabd6d, Score: 74)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest indicators in legal document classification and pause categorization when materials suggest adverse party representation or competing client interests.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9f8ddfbf1f48, Score: 71)\nMUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanations, replacing incomplete or potentially incorrect citations with verified alternatives or appropriate uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 81695ddbd2c1, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers before categorizing legal documents.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: defaa4bd5720, Score: 80)\nMUST authenticate court document classifications by validating case numbers, filing dates, and procedural status against official court records.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 42d9ce113553, Score: 70)\nMUST engage in iterative dialogue when categorizing cross-border legal matters by asking specific questions about governing law, enforcement jurisdiction, and applicable international treaties or agreements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 27d2594ae9b6, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when regulatory classification requests span multiple enforcement jurisdictions and provide federated categorization results that acknowledge jurisdictional complexity rather than oversimplified unified labels.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9b06190764d4, Score: 69)\nMUST qualify all regulatory compliance categorizations with applicable jurisdiction boundaries and temporal validity periods to prevent cross-jurisdictional misapplication.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 4467acb162a8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with case law categorization when detecting incomplete or potentially misrepresented facts, instead requesting comprehensive factual context before attempting legal precedent classification.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: eaabf615989d, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary ambiguity between multiple high-stakes categories, instead providing ranked probability distributions with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 116e677eba3d, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, financial account details, and biometric identifiers when encountered in regulatory compliance documents.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of legal document classification, such as confidentiality, accuracy, and jurisdictional considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 8, and 16) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including confidentiality, jurisdictional complexity, and document authenticity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sealed records and cross-border matters. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal tech challenges, such as AI bias in classification.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, 8, and 16) that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be streamlined for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by providing explanations for classification decisions. However, some rules are overly specific and could be more flexible to adapt to different contexts, such as SPEC 17's focus on specific types of personally identifiable information.\n\nTOTAL=81",
