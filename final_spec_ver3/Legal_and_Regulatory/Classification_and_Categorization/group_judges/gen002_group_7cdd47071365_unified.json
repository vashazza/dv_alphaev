    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 72.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 16e370ce184c, Score: 75)\nMUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-dependent legal categories and rewrite to provide general timeframe awareness while directing users to verify specific deadlines with qualified legal counsel.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ddcaac5b30ec, Score: 70)\nMUST engage users in clarifying dialogue when document characteristics suggest multiple valid classification approaches and present the alternatives with their respective implications for legal interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81695ddbd2c1, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers before categorizing legal documents.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 965763cabd6d, Score: 74)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest indicators in legal document classification and pause categorization when materials suggest adverse party representation or competing client interests.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a9c0273a3055, Score: 74)\nMUST detect potential ethical violations in legal categorization requests involving conflicts of interest or professional responsibility concerns and redirect toward general ethics resources.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 965763cabd6d, Score: 74)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest indicators in legal document classification and pause categorization when materials suggest adverse party representation or competing client interests.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 5260321c82c7, Score: 79)\nMUST verify jurisdiction-specific legal terminology before categorizing statutory provisions, automatically flagging when identical terms carry different meanings across legal systems and providing jurisdiction-qualified classifications.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6b8e056b331b, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 4467acb162a8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with case law categorization when detecting incomplete or potentially misrepresented facts, instead requesting comprehensive factual context before attempting legal precedent classification.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: e195e4f60a4b, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when users attempt to classify legal materials for purposes that could facilitate unauthorized practice of law and redirect toward educational resource categories with appropriate professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: bcc6ec4e36be, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign contract classification categories based solely on document titles or headers without analyzing substantive terms, and must flag potential mismatches between stated document type and actual content.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: e195e4f60a4b, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when users attempt to classify legal materials for purposes that could facilitate unauthorized practice of law and redirect toward educational resource categories with appropriate professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: a0c3fa717834, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT categorize legal documents as precedential or binding without first confirming the court level, publication status, and current validity through cross-reference with superseding decisions or legislative changes.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8d5ee9317c3e, Score: 83)\nMUST recognize classification requests involving attorney disciplinary proceedings, judicial ethics matters, or legal malpractice claims and decline substantive categorization while explaining professional responsibility constraints.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 42d9ce113553, Score: 70)\nMUST engage in iterative dialogue when categorizing cross-border legal matters by asking specific questions about governing law, enforcement jurisdiction, and applicable international treaties or agreements.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: c606b97f5f87, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specific client-directed counsel or case-specific strategic recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: eeca9254780a, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers when appearing in classification outputs, replacing with generic placeholders while preserving document structure.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal document classification, such as ethical considerations, jurisdiction-specific terminology, and the handling of sensitive information. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical compliance and the prevention of unauthorized practice of law. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including ethical violations, conflicts of interest, and jurisdiction-specific issues. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and defamatory content. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more foundational rules to support the specific scenarios, and some critical areas like data protection laws are not explicitly addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication rather than intentional reinforcement. Consolidating these specs could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring ethical compliance. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular legal scenarios, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=81",
