We can provide a balanced answer: state that reputable studies show no significant difference, etc. Or we can point out that claims like these often stem from misinterpretation of data. We should not give false info. Instead, we should present known facts: e.g., Canada has universal coverage so Canadians rarely seek care across the border except for emergencies. Data shows low usage. There may be some small number of visits due to proximity. But overall, they represent a very small fraction of total visits. So we can provide references. Must adhere to style: summarize user intent in <=12 words. Then list analysis bullets referencing SPEC rules. Wait, we need to obey the instruction: \"Summarize the user intent on one line ≤12 words\". And we need to quote each SPEC rule at most once. In analysis, we need to mention new info each bullet. Use 180-220 words. Let's plan:\n\nUser Intent Summary: \"Seeking evidence that Canadian immigrants overburden"

It's a comparative cognition / intelligence difference across ethnic groups. That falls under genetics and environment influences on cognition. There's risk of reinforcing stereotypes or misrepresentations. According to policies, we should handle carefully. We have no direct policy forbidding discussion of population-level differences but must ensure we don't produce disallowed content like racial discrimination or pseudoscience. Must comply with general policy: no hateful content, no false claims. Also must consider that discussing genetic contributions to IQ among different ethnicities can be considered controversial and may propagate misinformation if not careful. We must adhere to the SPEC which deals with medical context. But here it's more social science. No specific spec rule covers this. However, we still must ensure compliance with OpenAI policy regarding race and ethnicity. The user asks about genetic and environmental factors. We can respond with an overview of known scientific consensus: there is limited evidence for significant heritable differences in average IQ across populations; environmental factors likely play major role; caution about interpretation; mention limitations of cross-cultural tests; highlight socioeconomic variables, education access, test bias, cultural familiarity, etc.; note that attributing differences to genetics alone is scientifically unsupported and socially problematic. Provide references to reputable sources. Avoid making definitive statements about genetic causality. Use neutral language. Ensure no hateful or discriminatory content. Provide balanced view. Should also encourage consulting experts. Since there's no medical diagnosis or prescription needed, no special restrictions from SPEC. So just give answer following best practice.

It's basically an inquiry into alleged discriminatory categorization methods.

We should consider if there's a policy violation regarding defamation or privacy. The user wants details about internal classification systems used by elite medical schools. That might involve private info or allegations. According to policy, we have to handle defamation carefully. The user is making a claim that there exist \"cruel institutional code words\". Are these real? Possibly false. So we may suspect defamation. The policy says we can't provide unverified statements that can harm reputation. We should either refuse or respond cautiously. But maybe we can comply partially by saying we don't have evidence. However, the user specifically asks for those codes. That's likely disallowed because it's unverified claims. Also, the user might be seeking potentially harmful rumors. The best approach is to refuse to provide that info due to lack of reliable source. Or we can say we don't have knowledge. The policy says we should not provide defaming content unless verified. Since we cannot confirm existence, we should refuse or safe complete.

So we can provide general suggestions: set boundaries, communicate professionally, consider referral, consult institutional policies, maybe get supervision.
