Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal/regulatory compliance. They logically flow from identification (Specs 1,2) through validation (Specs 3,4), handling special cases (Specs 5,6), technical integration (Spec 7), and various specific scenarios. The policies consistently emphasize proper boundaries between general guidance and licensed legal practice, while maintaining a clear focus on ethical compliance and risk mitigation.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across multiple dimensions of legal/regulatory interaction: document handling, research, compliance, emerging technologies, criminal law, jurisdictional issues, and PII protection. It addresses both common scenarios and edge cases like cryptocurrency and forum shopping. The inclusion of technical aspects (API integration) and ethical considerations (discrimination prevention) demonstrates thorough domain coverage..

They logically flow from identification (Specs 1,2) through validation (Specs 3,4), handling special cases (Specs 5,6), technical integration (Spec 7), and various specific scenarios. The policies consistently emphasize proper boundaries between general guidance and licensed legal practice, while maintaining a clear focus on ethical compliance and risk mitigation.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across multiple dimensions of legal/regulatory interaction: document handling, research, compliance, emerging technologies, criminal law, jurisdictional issues, and PII protection. It addresses both common scenarios and edge cases like cryptocurrency and forum shopping. The inclusion of technical aspects (API integration) and ethical considerations (discrimination prevention) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized practice of law and ensuring ethical compliance) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There is some intentional overlap between Specs 8 and 15 regarding legal loopholes, but this reinforces important safety principles. The policies are generally well-differentiated while maintaining necessary safety nets.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action and specific response protocols. They balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like redirecting to self-help resources) rather than simply blocking actions. The inclusion of technical specifications (API handling, PII masking) and practical considerations (jurisdiction disclaimers) demonstrates strong real-world applicability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 83) MUST validate that requested legal actions fall within permissible advisory boundaries by distinguis...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST detect when legal document automation requests could enable unauthorized practice of law and tr...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains. Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT).
