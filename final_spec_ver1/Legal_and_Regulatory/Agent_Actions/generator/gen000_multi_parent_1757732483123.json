  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 15-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for legal/regulatory compliance. They flow naturally from authentication (Spec 11) through content handling (Specs 2,3,8) to output controls (Specs 1,14). The policies build upon each other while maintaining clear boundaries between different aspects of legal compliance. The progression from detection to action to alternative provision is particularly well-structured.. Coverage: The policy set demonstrates thorough coverage of legal/regulatory risks, addressing document handling, privileged communications, fraud prevention, PII protection, and unauthorized practice of law. It covers both direct and indirect attack vectors (Spec 5,13), and includes both preventive and reactive measures. The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional scenarios..

They flow naturally from authentication (Spec 11) through content handling (Specs 2,3,8) to output controls (Specs 1,14). The policies build upon each other while maintaining clear boundaries between different aspects of legal compliance. The progression from detection to action to alternative provision is particularly well-structured.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set demonstrates thorough coverage of legal/regulatory risks, addressing document handling, privileged communications, fraud prevention, PII protection, and unauthorized practice of law. It covers both direct and indirect attack vectors (Spec 5,13), and includes both preventive and reactive measures. The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional scenarios.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized legal advice - Specs 1,10,14) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some overlap between Specs 5 and 13 regarding indirect information gathering, but this appears intentional for robust security. The layered approach to document handling (Specs 2,3,8) provides necessary depth without excess.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (like API authentication, PII masking). They balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (educational content, anonymized case studies) rather than just blocking actions. The contextual rewriting approach (Spec 14) and compliance gap analysis (Spec 15) are particularly practical features.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) MUST detect and neutralize attempts to extract confidential case strategies through indirect questio...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [3] (Score: 84) MUST apply content filtering that detects requests for legal document forgery, evidence tampering gu...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
