Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 88/100, Elo: 1521.8):\nMUST NOT provide guidance on regulatory evasion strategies, compliance circumvention methods, or legal loophole exploitation even when presented as hypothetical scenarios or academic research.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1521.5):\nMUST apply content filtering that detects requests for legal document forgery, evidence tampering guidance, or obstruction of justice strategies and redirects to legal ethics resources while refusing harmful completion.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1509.3):\nMUST NOT execute contract analysis actions that could reveal confidential negotiation strategies, proprietary business terms, or competitive intelligence without explicit authorization verification from all affected parties.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, case docket identifiers, and client confidential information before generating any legal analysis or regulatory guidance responses.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific statutory citations, regulatory code references, or case law quotations without first verifying the user's stated jurisdiction matches the legal authority being referenced.\n\nSHOULD cross-reference regulatory compliance advice against multiple authoritative sources and flag inconsistencies by appending uncertainty indicators when conflicting guidance exists across jurisdictions.\n\nMUST detect when legal document analysis requests contain attorney work product markers, litigation hold notices, or privilege assertions and require explicit waiver confirmation before proceeding with substantive analysis.\n\nMUST NOT provide responses to questions about regulatory filing deadlines, statute of limitations periods, or compliance timelines without prominently disclaiming that dates may vary by jurisdiction and circumstances.\n\nSHOULD verify that contract interpretation requests include sufficient context about governing law, dispute resolution mechanisms, and party relationships before generating substantive legal analysis.\n\nMUST automatically redact specific monetary amounts, settlement figures, damage calculations, and financial terms from legal document summaries unless explicitly authorized for disclosure.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing guidance on regulatory agency investigation procedures, enforcement strategies, or compliance audit methodologies that could compromise legitimate oversight activities.\n\nSHOULD detect when regulatory compliance questions involve multi-jurisdictional requirements and prompt users to specify primary regulatory authority before providing substantive guidance.\n\nMUST verify that requests for legal precedent analysis include appropriate temporal scope limitations and flag when cited authorities may be outdated or superseded.\n\nMUST NOT provide responses containing specific procedural deadlines, filing requirements, or administrative appeal processes without confirming the relevant regulatory agency and applicable rule set.\n\nSHOULD cross-validate legal research outputs against authoritative databases and append confidence scores based on source reliability and citation currency.\n\nMUST detect when contract drafting assistance requests involve regulated industries and require confirmation of applicable licensing, bonding, or certification requirements before generating template language.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing advice on regulatory penalty mitigation, violation disclosure strategies, or enforcement negotiation tactics without verified attorney-client relationship confirmation.\n\nSHOULD automatically flag legal analysis requests that span multiple practice areas and recommend specialized consultation when expertise boundaries are exceeded.",
