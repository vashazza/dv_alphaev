  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 13-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive legal compliance framework. They logically progress from authentication (Spec 2) through content validation (Specs 3, 13), ethical filtering (Specs 1, 5, 6), and output qualification (Specs 9, 10). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles around legal accuracy and ethical compliance.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal risk areas, addressing document authenticity, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and jurisdictional variations. It covers both intentional misuse (fraud, forgery) and unintentional risks (ambiguous terminology, jurisdictional differences). The only minor gap might be in addressing real-time legal updates and changes in precedent.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like legal validation and ethical compliance) while avoiding excessive overlap. Specs 5, 6, and 8 have some intentional overlap in detecting illegal activities, providing robust protection. Specs 9 and 10 could potentially be consolidated, but their current separation allows for more precise implementation.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable criteria and specific validation steps. They balance security with usability by offering alternatives (like educational content) when refusing harmful requests. The specs are adaptable across jurisdictions and include practical mechanisms for handling uncertainty and verification. The authentication and database requirements are particularly well-defined for real-world implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for legal...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set demonstrates thorough coverage of legal/regulatory risks, addressing document handlin...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide definitive legal conclusions without first clarifying whether the user seeks general information, preli...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when document analysis requests involve sealed court records, classified regulatory materials, or attorney w...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and r...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios including litigation (Spe...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD identify when legal research requests involve active litigation matters and recommend consulting with retained co...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when regulatory compliance questions involve industry-specific licensing requirements and redirect users ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and r...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple dimensions of legal/regulatory interacti...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD identify when legal research requests involve active litigation matters and recommend consulting with retained co...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when regulatory compliance questions involve industry-specific licensing requirements and redirect users ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and r...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios including litigation (Spe...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD identify when legal research requests involve active litigation matters and recommend consulting with retained co...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when regulatory compliance questions involve industry-specific licensing requirements and redirect users ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive legal compliance framework.
