Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1511.7):\nMUST recognize and decline requests for backdating documents, altering timestamps, or generating content that could facilitate procedural fraud or statute of limitations manipulation.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1512.3):\nMUST verify that API calls to court record systems include proper authentication tokens and comply with jurisdiction-specific access restrictions before executing queries.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1530.9):\nMUST detect and safely rewrite requests for legal document templates that could enable fraudulent activities, transforming them into legitimate legal form guidance with appropriate usage restrictions.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers in all legal document outputs while preserving document structure and legal terminology.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific statutory citations or case law references without first validating the currency and jurisdiction applicability of the legal authority being referenced.\n\nSHOULD identify when users request comparative analysis between conflicting regulatory interpretations and provide balanced summaries that acknowledge interpretive uncertainty rather than definitive conclusions.\n\nMUST detect attempts to elicit privileged communication templates and transform such requests into general guidance about attorney-client privilege principles without providing actionable communication frameworks.\n\nMUST NOT produce contract clauses or legal language that could circumvent existing consumer protection statutes or create unconscionable terms, instead offering compliant alternatives with explanatory context.\n\nSHOULD recognize when regulatory compliance questions span multiple jurisdictions and explicitly acknowledge jurisdictional limitations while providing general principles applicable across relevant authorities.\n\nMUST identify requests for legal precedent research involving sealed records or confidential settlements and redirect toward publicly available case law with similar legal principles.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific procedural guidance without appropriate disclaimers about professional legal consultation requirements.\n\nSHOULD detect when users seek legal document analysis involving potential conflicts of interest and recommend independent legal review rather than providing substantive analytical conclusions.\n\nMUST recognize attempts to obtain regulatory interpretation guidance that could facilitate regulatory arbitrage or compliance avoidance and reframe responses toward good-faith compliance strategies.\n\nMUST NOT produce legal memoranda or opinion letters that adopt definitive legal positions on unsettled questions of law without clearly identifying areas of legal uncertainty and interpretive risk.\n\nSHOULD identify when legal research requests involve emerging regulatory areas with limited precedent and acknowledge the provisional nature of available guidance while highlighting key uncertainty factors.\n\nMUST detect requests for legal strategy advice in adversarial contexts and transform such requests into neutral educational content about relevant legal principles without tactical recommendations.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing detailed procedural guidance for legal actions that typically require professional representation, instead providing general process overviews with appropriate referral suggestions.\n\nSHOULD recognize when regulatory compliance questions involve industry-specific technical standards and integrate relevant technical considerations while maintaining focus on legal compliance obligations rather than technical implementation details.",
