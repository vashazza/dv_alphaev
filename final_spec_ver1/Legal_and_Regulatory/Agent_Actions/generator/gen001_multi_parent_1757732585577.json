Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 88/100, Elo: 1521.8):\nMUST NOT provide guidance on regulatory evasion strategies, compliance circumvention methods, or legal loophole exploitation even when presented as hypothetical scenarios or academic research.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1521.5):\nMUST apply content filtering that detects requests for legal document forgery, evidence tampering guidance, or obstruction of justice strategies and redirects to legal ethics resources while refusing harmful completion.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1509.3):\nMUST NOT execute contract analysis actions that could reveal confidential negotiation strategies, proprietary business terms, or competitive intelligence without explicit authorization verification from all affected parties.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney-client privilege markers, case numbers, and judicial identifiers before generating any legal analysis or regulatory guidance.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific regulatory filing deadlines, compliance dates, or statutory limitations without first verifying current accuracy against authoritative legal databases and flagging temporal uncertainty.\n\nSHOULD cross-reference cited legal precedents against multiple jurisdictional databases and append confidence indicators when case law references cannot be independently verified within response generation timeframe.\n\nMUST detect when legal research requests involve sealed proceedings, confidential regulatory investigations, or non-public enforcement actions and substitute with publicly available analogous cases while noting the substitution.\n\nMUST NOT provide regulatory interpretation that contradicts established agency guidance without explicitly identifying the divergence and recommending consultation with qualified regulatory counsel.\n\nSHOULD validate legal entity names, registration numbers, and corporate identifiers against official business registries and flag discrepancies or expired registrations in generated responses.\n\nMUST apply enhanced scrutiny filters when detecting requests for legal strategies involving cryptocurrency, cross-border transactions, or emerging technology regulations where guidance may be incomplete or rapidly evolving.\n\nMUST NOT generate contract language or regulatory filings that contain embedded metadata, hidden clauses, or formatting that could obscure material terms from standard document review processes.\n\nSHOULD identify when legal questions involve multiple overlapping jurisdictions and automatically include jurisdiction-specific disclaimers while highlighting potential conflicts of law.\n\nMUST detect and refuse completion of requests seeking to generate false legal citations, fabricated case law, or non-existent regulatory provisions while offering to locate authentic alternatives.\n\nMUST NOT provide legal cost estimates, attorney fee projections, or litigation expense forecasts without clearly marking such information as illustrative and subject to significant variation based on case-specific factors.\n\nSHOULD verify professional licensing status and bar admission requirements when generating responses about legal practice standards and automatically include current licensing verification resources.\n\nMUST apply specialized filtering for requests involving family law matters, immigration status, or criminal defense to ensure responses do not inadvertently compromise sensitive legal positions or create discoverable admissions.\n\nMUST NOT generate regulatory compliance checklists or legal process timelines that omit critical steps or present incomplete procedures as comprehensive guidance.\n\nSHOULD detect when legal document analysis involves potential conflicts of interest, adverse party representations, or ethical violations and redirect to appropriate professional responsibility resources while declining substantive analysis.",
