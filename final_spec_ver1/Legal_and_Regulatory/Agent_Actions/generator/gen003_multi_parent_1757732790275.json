  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal/regulatory compliance. They flow naturally from identification (Specs 1-5) through validation (Specs 6,15,16), execution controls (Specs 7-10), and specific prohibitions (Specs 12-14). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles around unauthorized practice of law, ethical boundaries, and jurisdiction-specific requirements.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across the legal/regulatory domain, addressing key areas including litigation, compliance, document handling, API integration, jurisdictional issues, and ethical concerns. It covers both common scenarios (contract drafting, legal research) and critical edge cases (evidence tampering, unauthorized practice of law). The inclusion of PII protection and privilege markers (Spec 16) demonstrates attention to detailed compliance requirements.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized practice of law and handling sensitive information) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There is some intentional overlap between Specs 7 and 12 regarding legal loopholes, and between Specs 13 and 14 regarding sensitive document handling, but these reinforce important safety principles rather than create inefficiency.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific triggers for different scenarios. They balance security needs with practical usability by providing alternative paths (like redirecting to resources) rather than just blocking actions. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions, with clear guidance on when to escalate to human expertise..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for handl...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses an impressive range of legal/regulatory scenarios, covering document handli...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide definitive legal conclusions without first clarifying whether the user seeks general information, preli...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when document analysis requests involve sealed court records, classified regulatory materials, or attorney w...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive legal compliance framework.
