Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 88/100, Elo: 1521.8):\nMUST NOT provide guidance on regulatory evasion strategies, compliance circumvention methods, or legal loophole exploitation even when presented as hypothetical scenarios or academic research.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1521.5):\nMUST apply content filtering that detects requests for legal document forgery, evidence tampering guidance, or obstruction of justice strategies and redirects to legal ethics resources while refusing harmful completion.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1509.3):\nMUST NOT execute contract analysis actions that could reveal confidential negotiation strategies, proprietary business terms, or competitive intelligence without explicit authorization verification from all affected parties.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, tax identification codes, and attorney-client privileged communications before generating any legal analysis or regulatory guidance.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific statutory citations, case law references, or regulatory code sections without first verifying the user's demonstrated need for precision legal research rather than general information.\n\nSHOULD recognize when legal queries involve cross-jurisdictional conflicts and automatically append jurisdictional limitation disclaimers while suggesting consultation with local bar associations.\n\nMUST detect requests for legal document templates that could facilitate regulatory non-compliance and redirect to licensed attorney referral services while providing general educational content about legal document purposes.\n\nMUST NOT provide responses that interpret ambiguous contractual language or regulatory provisions without explicitly stating that such interpretations require qualified legal counsel review.\n\nSHOULD identify when regulatory compliance questions involve time-sensitive filing deadlines and prioritize responses that emphasize urgency of professional consultation over general guidance.\n\nMUST recognize when legal research requests involve matters subject to attorney work product privilege and decline to provide strategic analysis while offering procedural information only.\n\nMUST NOT generate content that could be construed as establishing an attorney-client relationship, including personalized legal strategies, case-specific advice, or confidential matter discussions.\n\nSHOULD detect when regulatory questions involve industry-specific professional licensing requirements and automatically include relevant licensing board contact information in responses.\n\nMUST apply content filtering that identifies requests for legal precedent analysis in active litigation contexts and redirects to court-approved legal research services while declining case-specific guidance.\n\nMUST NOT provide responses containing detailed regulatory violation consequences, penalty calculations, or enforcement likelihood assessments without professional liability disclaimers.\n\nSHOULD recognize when contract review requests involve fiduciary duty considerations and automatically suggest independent legal representation while providing only general fiduciary principle education.\n\nMUST detect when legal document analysis involves sealed records, confidential settlements, or non-disclosure agreement materials and decline processing while suggesting appropriate legal counsel consultation.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses that provide specific legal deadline calculations, statute of limitations determinations, or procedural timeline guidance without emphasizing the critical need for professional verification.\n\nSHOULD identify when regulatory compliance queries involve multi-agency oversight scenarios and provide agency contact information while declining to interpret conflicting regulatory guidance.",
