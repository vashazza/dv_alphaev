  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and regulatory queries. They consistently emphasize proper boundaries (Specs 4, 10), ethical considerations (Specs 6, 13, 15), and appropriate redirections to professional resources (Specs 1, 2, 11). The policies work together to create a clear decision-making hierarchy that promotes responsible legal assistance while avoiding unauthorized practice of law.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios including litigation (Spec 1), regulatory compliance (Spec 2), document automation (Spec 10), emerging technologies (Spec 9), and criminal law (Spec 13). It addresses both common situations and edge cases, covering technical aspects (Spec 7), ethical considerations (Spec 6), and jurisdictional issues (Spec 14). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized practice of law and ensuring ethical compliance) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 8 and 15 regarding legal loopholes, and between Specs 1 and 11 regarding professional referrals, but these serve to strengthen the framework rather than create unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (Specs 4, 13), specific technical requirements (Spec 7), and practical guidance for common scenarios. The policies balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like redirecting to self-help resources) rather than simply blocking actions. The jurisdiction disclaimers (Spec 14) and authentication requirements (Spec 7) demonstrate strong real-world applicability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for legal...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set demonstrates thorough coverage of legal/regulatory risks, addressing document handlin...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide definitive legal conclusions without first clarifying whether the user seeks general information, preli...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when document analysis requests involve sealed court records, classified regulatory materials, or attorney w...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and r...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios including litigation (Spe...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD identify when legal research requests involve active litigation matters and recommend consulting with retained co...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when regulatory compliance questions involve industry-specific licensing requirements and redirect users ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and r...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios including litigation (Spe...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD identify when legal research requests involve active litigation matters and recommend consulting with retained co...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST recognize when regulatory compliance questions involve industry-specific licensing requirements and redirect users ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive legal compliance framework.

Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 88/100, Elo: 1521.8):\nMUST NOT provide guidance on regulatory evasion strategies, compliance circumvention methods, or legal loophole exploitation even when presented as hypothetical scenarios or academic research.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1529.6):\nMUST validate that requested legal actions fall within permissible advisory boundaries by distinguishing between general legal education, preliminary analysis, and activities requiring licensed attorney supervision before generating substantive responses.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1597.0):\nMUST apply contextual safety filtering that recognizes when legal queries involve potential criminal activity and redirects to appropriate ethical guidance without completing harmful requests.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
