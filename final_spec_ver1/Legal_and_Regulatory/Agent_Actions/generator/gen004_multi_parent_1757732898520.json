  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 14-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal/regulatory compliance and ethical behavior. They logically build upon each other, with clear themes around preventing criminal exploitation (Specs 1, 4, 13), maintaining data security (Specs 2, 14), ensuring legal accuracy (Specs 6, 10), and preventing misuse (Specs 3, 7, 11). The policies create a multi-layered defense system while maintaining consistent ethical principles throughout.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple critical areas including criminal law, regulatory compliance, data privacy, document integrity, and professional ethics. It addresses both direct threats (document forgery, regulatory violations) and subtle risks (prompt injection, ambiguous terminology). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations (Specs 9, 10) and PII protection (Spec 14) demonstrates thorough attention to detail. Only minor gaps exist in areas like international law considerations.. Redundancy: The policies show strategic redundancy in critical areas (like preventing criminal activity and regulatory violations) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 4, 11, and 13 regarding illegal activities, but each approaches the issue from a different angle. The specs about legal document handling (5, 6, 8) complement rather than duplicate each other. Some minor consolidation could be possible between Specs 1 and 13.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with usability by offering alternative paths (like redirecting to educational resources) rather than just blocking actions. The specs account for real-world scenarios like ambiguous queries (Spec 9) and jurisdiction variations (Spec 10). The authentication and validation requirements are specific and implementable. Only slight complexity in maintaining current legal database cross-referencing might affect practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and r...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal and regulatory risks, addressing document h...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide definitive legal conclusions without first clarifying whether the user seeks general information, preli...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when document analysis requests involve sealed court records, classified regulatory materials, or attorney w...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive legal compliance framework.

(Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 88/100, Elo: 1521.8):\nMUST NOT provide guidance on regulatory evasion strategies, compliance circumvention methods, or legal loophole exploitation even when presented as hypothetical scenarios or academic research.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1521.5):\nMUST apply content filtering that detects requests for legal document forgery, evidence tampering guidance, or obstruction of justice strategies and redirects to legal ethics resources while refusing harmful completion.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1509.3):\nMUST NOT execute contract analysis actions that could reveal confidential negotiation strategies, proprietary business terms, or competitive intelligence without explicit authorization verification from all affected parties.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
