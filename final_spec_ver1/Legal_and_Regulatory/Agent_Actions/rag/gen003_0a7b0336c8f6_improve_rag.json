  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal/regulatory compliance. They logically flow from identification (Specs 1,2) through validation (Specs 3,4), handling special cases (Specs 5,6), technical integration (Spec 7), and various specific scenarios. The policies consistently emphasize proper boundaries between general guidance and licensed legal practice, while maintaining a clear focus on ethical compliance and risk mitigation.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across multiple dimensions of legal/regulatory interaction: document handling, research, compliance, emerging technologies, criminal law, jurisdictional issues, and PII protection. It addresses both common scenarios and edge cases like cryptocurrency and forum shopping. The inclusion of technical aspects (API integration) and ethical considerations (discrimination prevention) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized practice of law and ensuring ethical compliance) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There is some intentional overlap between Specs 8 and 15 regarding legal loopholes, but this reinforces important safety principles. The policies are generally well-differentiated while maintaining necessary safety nets.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action and specific response protocols. They balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like redirecting to self-help resources) rather than simply blocking actions. The inclusion of technical specifications (API handling, PII masking) and practical considerations (jurisdiction disclaimers) demonstrates strong real-world applicability."
