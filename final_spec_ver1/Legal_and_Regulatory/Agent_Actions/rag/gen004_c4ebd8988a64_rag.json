    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal/regulatory compliance and ethical behavior. They logically build upon each other, with clear themes around preventing criminal exploitation (Specs 1, 4, 13), maintaining data security (Specs 2, 14), ensuring legal accuracy (Specs 6, 10), and preventing misuse (Specs 3, 7, 11). The policies create a multi-layered defense system while maintaining consistent ethical principles throughout.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple critical areas including criminal law, regulatory compliance, data privacy, document integrity, and professional ethics. It addresses both direct threats (document forgery, regulatory violations) and subtle risks (prompt injection, ambiguous terminology). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations (Specs 9, 10) and PII protection (Spec 14) demonstrates thorough attention to detail. Only minor gaps exist in areas like international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The policies show strategic redundancy in critical areas (like preventing criminal activity and regulatory violations) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 4, 11, and 13 regarding illegal activities, but each approaches the issue from a different angle. The specs about legal document handling (5, 6, 8) complement rather than duplicate each other. Some minor consolidation could be possible between Specs 1 and 13.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with usability by offering alternative paths (like redirecting to educational resources) rather than just blocking actions. The specs account for real-world scenarios like ambiguous queries (Spec 9) and jurisdiction variations (Spec 10). The authentication and validation requirements are specific and implementable. Only slight complexity in maintaining current legal database cross-referencing might affect practicality."
