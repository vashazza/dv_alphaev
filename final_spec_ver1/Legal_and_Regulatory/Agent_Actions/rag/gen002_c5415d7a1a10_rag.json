    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and regulatory queries. They consistently emphasize proper boundaries (Specs 4, 10), ethical considerations (Specs 6, 13, 15), and appropriate redirections to professional resources (Specs 1, 2, 11). The policies work together to create a clear decision-making hierarchy that progresses from identification to action.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple dimensions of legal/regulatory interaction. It addresses traditional legal research (Spec 3), emerging technologies (Spec 9), document automation (Spec 10), criminal law (Spec 13), jurisdictional issues (Specs 12, 14), and various specialized areas. The inclusion of both procedural safeguards and content-based restrictions provides comprehensive protection against misuse.",
    "redundancy": "The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized practice of law and harmful advice) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 8 and 15 regarding loopholes/evasion, and between Specs 1, 2, and 11 regarding professional referrals, but these serve to strengthen rather than duplicate protection in crucial areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers and actions. The specs provide concrete guidance for handling common scenarios (like document automation and research requests) while remaining flexible enough to adapt to different contexts. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, with appropriate use of MUST/SHOULD distinctions."
