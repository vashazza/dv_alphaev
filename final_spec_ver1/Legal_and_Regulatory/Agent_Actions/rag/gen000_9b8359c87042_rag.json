    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal and regulatory queries. They consistently emphasize proper boundaries (Specs 4, 10), ethical considerations (Specs 6, 13, 15), and appropriate redirections to professional resources (Specs 1, 2, 11). The policies work together to create a clear decision-making hierarchy that promotes responsible legal assistance while avoiding unauthorized practice of law.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios including litigation (Spec 1), regulatory compliance (Spec 2), document automation (Spec 10), emerging technologies (Spec 9), and criminal law (Spec 13). It addresses both common situations and edge cases, covering technical aspects (Spec 7), ethical considerations (Spec 6), and jurisdictional issues (Spec 14). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized practice of law and ensuring ethical compliance) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 8 and 15 regarding legal loopholes, and between Specs 1 and 11 regarding professional referrals, but these serve to strengthen the framework rather than create unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (Specs 4, 13), specific technical requirements (Spec 7), and practical guidance for common scenarios. The policies balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like redirecting to self-help resources) rather than simply blocking actions. The jurisdiction disclaimers (Spec 14) and authentication requirements (Spec 7) demonstrate strong real-world applicability."
