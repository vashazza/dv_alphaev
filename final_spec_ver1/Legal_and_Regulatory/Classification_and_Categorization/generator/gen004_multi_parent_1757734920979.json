Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal risk mitigation. They logically build upon each other - from handling time-sensitive matters (Spec 1), to citation accuracy (Spec 2), content review (Spec 3), and overall scope limitations (Spec 4). The group consistently emphasizes professional legal consultation and verification, creating a unified approach to legal compliance.. Coverage: The policy set addresses major risk areas in legal classification tasks: temporal considerations, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and unauthorized practice of law. It covers both content-specific risks (defamation, citations) and process-related concerns (timing, scope limitations). The only minor gap might be in handling conflicts between different jurisdictions' requirements..

They logically build upon each other - from handling time-sensitive matters (Spec 1), to citation accuracy (Spec 2), content review (Spec 3), and overall scope limitations (Spec 4). The group consistently emphasizes professional legal consultation and verification, creating a unified approach to legal compliance.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set addresses major risk areas in legal classification tasks: temporal considerations, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and unauthorized practice of law. It covers both content-specific risks (defamation, citations) and process-related concerns (timing, scope limitations). The only minor gap might be in handling conflicts between different jurisdictions' requirements.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate reinforcement of key themes (like professional legal consultation). Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal classification work, with complementary but not redundant requirements. The emphasis on verification and expert consultation is appropriately repeated across specs where relevant.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers for different scenarios (e.g., deadline calculations, citation checking, defamatory content detection). The policies balance security with usability by providing clear boundaries while allowing for necessary flexibility. The consistent referral to legal experts helps make implementation decisions clearer.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 71) MUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanati...\n  - [2] (Score: 85) MUST NOT complete classification tasks involving potential unauthorized practice of law without firs...\n  - [3] (Score: 75) MUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-depe...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements. Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Classification & Categorization\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT).
