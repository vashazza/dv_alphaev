  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal document classification. They logically build upon each other, from basic authentication (Specs 1-2) to handling complex scenarios (Specs 4, 12, 14). The policies consistently emphasize accuracy, ethical considerations, and proper handling of sensitive information. Clear thematic connections exist between specs dealing with authentication, privacy, jurisdictional boundaries, and professional responsibility.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal document classification scenarios. It addresses primary concerns (authentication, categorization), secondary issues (jurisdictional boundaries, temporal validity), and edge cases (indigenous legal concepts, unauthorized practice of law). The specs cover technical, ethical, and procedural aspects comprehensively. Only minor gaps exist in international law considerations and emerging legal technologies.. Redundancy: The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas (authentication, verification) without excessive overlap. While Specs 1, 2, and 13 share authentication themes, each addresses distinct aspects. The redundancy in verification processes (Specs 13, 14) is justified given the high-stakes nature of legal classification. The group efficiently consolidates related requirements while maintaining necessary safety checks.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific criteria for implementation. The policies balance security needs with operational efficiency, providing clear guidance for edge cases (Specs 4, 12). The framework adapts well to different legal contexts and jurisdictions. The technical requirements are realistic and achievable with current technology, though some specs (7, 11) may require sophisticated NLP capabilities..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal document class...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal document classification scenarios.
