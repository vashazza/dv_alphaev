Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework for legal document handling and classification. They logically progress from temporal considerations (Spec 1) through citation validation (Spec 2) to content safety (Spec 3) and privacy protection (Spec 4). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining clear boundaries between different types of legal concerns.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates strong coverage across key legal risk areas including time-sensitive matters, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and privacy protection. It addresses both content-level risks (defamation, PII) and process-level concerns (citations, deadlines). The only minor gap might be in handling jurisdictional variations in legal requirements..

They logically progress from temporal considerations (Spec 1) through citation validation (Spec 2) to content safety (Spec 3) and privacy protection (Spec 4). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining clear boundaries between different types of legal concerns.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates strong coverage across key legal risk areas including time-sensitive matters, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and privacy protection. It addresses both content-level risks (defamation, PII) and process-level concerns (citations, deadlines). The only minor gap might be in handling jurisdictional variations in legal requirements.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal document handling, with complementary but non-duplicative requirements. The privacy and content review mechanisms (Specs 3 & 4) work together without excessive overlap.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., types of PII to mask, handling of citations). The policies balance security needs with practical usability by incorporating human review where needed and providing clear alternatives when exact information cannot be provided. The automated detection requirements are realistic and achievable.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary amb...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specif...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
