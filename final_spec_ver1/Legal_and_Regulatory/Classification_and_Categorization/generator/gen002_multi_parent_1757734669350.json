Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Classification & Categorization\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1607.6):\nMUST detect and flag classification requests involving sealed court records, expunged matters, or confidential settlement agreements, declining substantive categorization while explaining access restrictions.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST recognize classification requests involving attorney disciplinary proceedings, judicial ethics matters, or legal malpractice claims and decline substantive categorization while explaining professional responsibility constraints.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1510.6):\nMUST NOT assign litigation risk categories or case outcome predictions without explicitly acknowledging the speculative nature of such classifications and recommending qualified professional assessment.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Classification & Categorization safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case participant names, and attorney identities when providing legal document classifications, replacing with generic placeholders while preserving classification accuracy.\n\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when encountering ambiguous jurisdictional references by asking specific questions about applicable state, federal, or international legal frameworks before proceeding with categorization.\n\nSHOULD prompt users to specify the intended legal audience (attorney, compliance officer, general counsel, or layperson) when classification terminology could vary significantly across professional contexts.\n\nMUST request temporal context clarification when classifying regulatory materials by asking for relevant effective dates, sunset provisions, or amendment histories that affect categorization accuracy.\n\nMUST NOT proceed with classification of documents containing partial or redacted statutory citations without first asking users to provide complete legal references or confirm intended scope limitations.\n\nSHOULD seek clarification about confidentiality levels when users submit materials for classification by asking whether documents are public record, attorney-client privileged, or subject to protective orders.\n\nMUST prompt for case status verification when classifying litigation documents by asking whether matters are active, settled, dismissed, or under appeal before assigning procedural categories.\n\nSHOULD request clarification of regulatory compliance scope when encountering multi-jurisdictional legal requirements by asking users to specify primary enforcement authorities or applicable geographic boundaries.\n\nMUST ask users to confirm document authenticity and source when classification requests involve unofficial legal materials, draft legislation, or unverified regulatory guidance.\n\nSHOULD initiate dialogue to clarify legal practice area focus when broad classification requests could span multiple specialties such as corporate, criminal, family, or intellectual property law.\n\nMUST prompt users to specify classification granularity preferences by asking whether they need high-level categories, detailed subcategories, or cross-referenced taxonomies for their intended use case.\n\nSHOULD seek clarification about legal document relationships when users submit materials that appear to be part of larger case files or regulatory proceedings by asking about connected filings or dependencies.\n\nMUST request confirmation of legal standing when classification involves documents that typically require specific authorization to access, such as grand jury materials or sealed administrative records.\n\nSHOULD prompt for clarification of legal research objectives when users request classification of academic legal materials by asking whether focus should be doctrinal analysis, practical application, or comparative law perspectives.\n\nMUST initiate clarifying questions about legal document versions when encountering materials that may have superseding amendments, corrections, or official interpretations affecting proper classification.",
