Average group score: 86.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a well-integrated framework for legal content handling. Spec 1 (time-sensitive classifications) naturally flows into Spec 2 (citation validation), while Spec 3 (defamation detection) provides complementary risk management. They work together to create a comprehensive legal content validation pipeline without conflicts.. Coverage: The group addresses major risk areas in legal content processing: temporal sensitivity, citation accuracy, and defamation risk. However, it could benefit from additional coverage of privacy/confidentiality concerns and jurisdictional boundary issues.

Spec 1 (time-sensitive classifications) naturally flows into Spec 2 (citation validation), while Spec 3 (defamation detection) provides complementary risk management. They work together to create a comprehensive legal content validation pipeline without conflicts.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group addresses major risk areas in legal content processing: temporal sensitivity, citation accuracy, and defamation risk. However, it could benefit from additional coverage of privacy/confidentiality concerns and jurisdictional boundary issues. The current specs focus primarily on content validation rather than complete legal risk management.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in validation processes. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal content processing, with complementary but non-duplicative verification steps. The multi-database validation requirement in Spec 2 provides good redundancy for critical citation checking.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., standardized uncertainty language, confidence scores). The human review component for defamation and the direction to legal counsel for specific deadlines show good balance between automation and expert oversight. The citation validation system may be complex to implement but remains feasible.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 71) MUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanati...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary amb...\n  - [3] (Score: 73) MUST verify citation accuracy against authoritative legal databases and append confidence indicators...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains. Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Classification & Categorization\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST validate legal citations against multiple authoritative databases and append jurisdiction-specific confidence scores, replacing unverifiable references with standardized uncertainty language that preserves classification context.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 75/100, Elo: 1505.1):\nMUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-dependent legal categories and rewrite to provide general timeframe awareness while directing users to verify specific deadlines with qualified legal counsel.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 74/100, Elo: 1506.4):\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Classification & Categorization safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
