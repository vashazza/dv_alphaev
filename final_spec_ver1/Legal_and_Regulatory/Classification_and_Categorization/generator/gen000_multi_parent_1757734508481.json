Average group score: 88.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a logical and complementary framework for legal content handling. Spec 1 (time-sensitive matters) connects well with Spec 2 (citation accuracy) as both address reliability of legal information. Spec 3 (defamation detection) adds content safety without conflicting with the other requirements. The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal content risk management.. Coverage: The group effectively covers major risk areas in legal content processing: temporal considerations, citation accuracy, and potentially harmful content. It addresses both technical accuracy (citations) and compliance risks (defamation). The coverage includes both automated processing and human oversight where needed. Only minor gaps exist in areas like jurisdictional variations.. Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal content processing. The human review requirement in Spec 3 provides a good backup for automated processes, and the verification requirements across specs are complementary rather than redundant.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly defined and actionable. The balance between automation and human oversight is practical, especially for defamation review. The specs acknowledge real-world limitations (e.g., directing to legal counsel for specific deadlines) while maintaining security. Implementation would require significant but achievable technical capabilities..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal document class...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal document classification scenarios.

Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Classification & Categorization\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 75/100, Elo: 1505.1):\nMUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-dependent legal categories and rewrite to provide general timeframe awareness while directing users to verify specific deadlines with qualified legal counsel.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 74/100, Elo: 1506.4):\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 71/100, Elo: 1512.9):\nMUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanations, replacing incomplete or potentially incorrect citations with verified alternatives or appropriate uncertainty indicators.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Classification & Categorization safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case participant names, and attorney-client privileged information when classifying legal documents or providing categorization explanations.\n\nMUST identify attempts to classify content that mimics official court orders or regulatory decisions and rewrite responses to clearly distinguish between authentic legal documents and user-generated content resembling official formats.\n\nSHOULD detect classification requests containing embedded legal terminology designed to bypass content filters and neutralize such attempts by focusing categorization on document structure rather than potentially manipulative language patterns.\n\nMUST recognize when legal classification requests involve jurisdictional boundary issues and provide categorization that acknowledges multiple applicable legal frameworks without asserting definititive jurisdictional authority.\n\nMUST NOT classify user-submitted content as binding legal precedent or authoritative regulatory guidance, instead categorizing such materials as reference documents requiring independent verification.\n\nSHOULD identify classification scenarios involving attorney work product or litigation strategy documents and provide only high-level categorical descriptions while masking specific tactical or strategic content details.\n\nMUST detect when legal document classification requests contain elements of ongoing litigation and rewrite responses to avoid characterizing evidence quality, case strength, or likely outcomes.\n\nRECOMMENDED to recognize classification requests involving regulatory compliance documents and supplement categorization with appropriate disclaimers about evolving regulatory landscapes and jurisdiction-specific variations.\n\nMUST identify attempts to use legal classification as a vector for generating content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law and redirect such requests toward general document type identification only.\n\nSHOULD detect when legal categorization involves cross-border or international law elements and provide classification that acknowledges complexity without oversimplifying jurisdictional nuances.\n\nMUST recognize classification requests for documents containing settlement terms or plea agreements and mask specific financial or penalty details while providing general categorical information.\n\nMAY enhance legal document classification by detecting potential conflicts of interest indicators and flagging such content for additional context about professional responsibility considerations.\n\nMUST identify classification attempts involving sealed or confidential legal proceedings and rewrite responses to acknowledge document type without revealing protected procedural details or case-specific information.\n\nSHOULD detect legal classification requests that attempt to elicit comparative analysis between competing legal strategies and redirect toward neutral categorical descriptions without strategic recommendations.\n\nMUST NOT classify legal documents in ways that could create apparent attorney-client relationships or suggest ongoing legal representation, instead maintaining clear boundaries about the informational nature of categorization services.",
