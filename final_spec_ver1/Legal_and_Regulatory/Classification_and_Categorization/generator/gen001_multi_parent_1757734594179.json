Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework for legal document handling and classification. They logically progress from temporal considerations (Spec 1) through citation validation (Spec 2) to content safety (Spec 3) and privacy protection (Spec 4). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining clear boundaries between different types of legal concerns.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates strong coverage across key legal risk areas including time-sensitive matters, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and privacy protection. It addresses both content-level risks (defamation, PII) and process-level concerns (citations, deadlines). The only minor gap might be in handling jurisdictional variations in legal requirements..

They logically progress from temporal considerations (Spec 1) through citation validation (Spec 2) to content safety (Spec 3) and privacy protection (Spec 4). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining clear boundaries between different types of legal concerns.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates strong coverage across key legal risk areas including time-sensitive matters, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and privacy protection. It addresses both content-level risks (defamation, PII) and process-level concerns (citations, deadlines). The only minor gap might be in handling jurisdictional variations in legal requirements.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal document handling, with complementary but non-duplicative requirements. The privacy and content review mechanisms (Specs 3 & 4) work together without excessive overlap.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., types of PII to mask, handling of citations). The policies balance security needs with practical usability by incorporating human review where needed and providing clear alternatives when exact information cannot be provided. The automated detection requirements are realistic and achievable.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary amb...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST NOT classify legal advice content as general information when language patterns indicate specif...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.

  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case participant names, addresses, financial account numbers, and attorney-client privileged communications when providing legal document classification responses or explanations.\n\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when legal classification requests contain ambiguous jurisdictional indicators, asking specifically which legal system, court level, or regulatory framework applies before proceeding with categorization.\n\nSHOULD detect classification requests involving sealed records, expunged cases, or confidential settlement agreements and rewrite responses to acknowledge document sensitivity while requesting additional context about permissible disclosure levels.\n\nMUST identify when legal document classification requests span multiple practice areas or regulatory domains and engage users through targeted questions to establish primary classification priorities and secondary considerations.\n\nSHOULD NOT provide definitive legal category assignments when document excerpts contain incomplete statutory citations or truncated case references, instead prompting users to provide complete legal authorities for accurate classification.\n\nMUST detect attempts to classify legal documents containing potential attorney work product or litigation strategy materials and redirect conversation toward general document type identification rather than substantive content categorization.\n\nRECOMMENDED to engage clarifying dialogue when classification requests involve cross-border legal matters, asking users to specify which jurisdiction's classification system should take precedence for categorization purposes.\n\nMUST identify legal document classification requests that reference time-sensitive procedural requirements and rewrite responses to provide general category information while emphasizing the need for current procedural rule verification.\n\nSHOULD detect classification requests involving documents with redacted or partially obscured content and prompt users to clarify whether classification should be based on visible content only or if additional context is available.\n\nMUST NOT assign categorical labels to legal documents when confidence scoring indicates boundary ambiguity between multiple legal specialties, instead engaging users to specify intended use case for the classification.\n\nSHOULD initiate targeted questioning when legal document classification requests involve regulatory compliance materials that may be subject to frequent updates or jurisdiction-specific variations.\n\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest indicators in legal document classification requests and rewrite responses to focus on general document structure analysis rather than substantive legal categorization.\n\nRECOMMENDED to engage clarifying dialogue when classification requests involve legal documents that appear to contain both public record information and potentially privileged communications within the same text.\n\nMUST identify classification requests for legal documents that reference emergency procedures, injunctive relief, or urgent legal matters and prompt users to confirm whether immediate professional consultation has been considered.\n\nSHOULD detect legal document classification requests that involve comparative law elements or foreign legal concepts and ask users to specify whether classification should follow domestic legal categories or accommodate international legal frameworks.",
