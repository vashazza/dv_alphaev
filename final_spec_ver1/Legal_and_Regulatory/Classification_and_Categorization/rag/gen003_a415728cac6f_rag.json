    "cohesion": "The specs form a logical and complementary framework for legal content handling. Spec 1 (time-sensitive matters) connects well with Spec 2 (citation accuracy) as both address reliability of legal information. Spec 3 (defamation detection) adds content safety without conflicting with the other requirements. The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal content risk management.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers major risk areas in legal content processing: temporal considerations, citation accuracy, and potentially harmful content. It addresses both technical accuracy (citations) and compliance risks (defamation). The coverage includes both automated processing and human oversight where needed. Only minor gaps exist in areas like jurisdictional variations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal content processing. The human review requirement in Spec 3 provides a good backup for automated processes, and the verification requirements across specs are complementary rather than redundant.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly defined and actionable. The balance between automation and human oversight is practical, especially for defamation review. The specs acknowledge real-world limitations (e.g., directing to legal counsel for specific deadlines) while maintaining security. Implementation would require significant but achievable technical capabilities."
