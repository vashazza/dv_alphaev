    "cohesion": "The specs form a well-integrated framework for legal content handling. Spec 1 (time-sensitive classifications) naturally flows into Spec 2 (citation validation), while Spec 3 (defamation detection) provides complementary risk management. They work together to create a comprehensive legal content validation pipeline without conflicts.",
    "coverage": "The group addresses key risk areas in legal content processing: temporal considerations, citation accuracy, and potentially harmful content. It covers both procedural aspects (deadlines, citations) and substantive legal risks (defamation). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations and uncertainty handling demonstrates good attention to edge cases.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal content processing, with complementary but non-duplicative verification requirements. The human review component is appropriately emphasized for high-risk content.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., \"standardized uncertainty language,\" \"jurisdiction-specific confidence scores\"). The balance between automated processing and human oversight is well-considered. The specs acknowledge practical limitations by directing to legal counsel when needed."
