    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal document classification. They logically build upon each other, from basic authentication (Specs 1-2) through PII protection (Spec 3), conflict detection (Spec 4), and specialized handling requirements (Specs 5-15). The policies consistently emphasize accuracy, verification, and appropriate handling of complex legal scenarios while maintaining legal principles throughout.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal document classification scenarios, addressing authentication, privacy, conflicts of interest, jurisdictional boundaries, cultural sensitivity, and edge cases. It covers both routine and complex situations, including cross-border matters, multi-practice areas, and confidence thresholds. The inclusion of specialized scenarios like indigenous legal concepts (Spec 6) and judicial conduct complaints (Spec 8) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary redundancy while maintaining appropriate overlapping protections where needed (e.g., multiple verification steps for critical legal documents). While Specs 10, 13, 14, and 15 all address complex classification scenarios, each approaches the challenge from a distinct angle. The authentication and verification requirements (Specs 1, 2, 11) are appropriately reinforcing rather than redundant.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific criteria for authentication, classification, and handling of edge cases. The policies balance security and accuracy with usability through features like iterative dialogue (Spec 15) and confidence indicators (Spec 11). The main practical challenge might be implementing all verification steps while maintaining system performance, but the requirements remain realistic."
