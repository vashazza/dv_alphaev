    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal risk mitigation. They logically build upon each other - from handling time-sensitive matters (Spec 1), to citation accuracy (Spec 2), content review (Spec 3), and overall scope limitations (Spec 4). The group consistently emphasizes professional legal consultation and verification, creating a unified approach to legal compliance.",
    "coverage": "The policy set addresses major risk areas in legal classification tasks: temporal considerations, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and unauthorized practice of law. It covers both content-specific risks (defamation, citations) and process-related concerns (timing, scope limitations). The only minor gap might be in handling conflicts between different jurisdictions' requirements.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate reinforcement of key themes (like professional legal consultation). Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal classification work, with complementary but not redundant requirements. The emphasis on verification and expert consultation is appropriately repeated across specs where relevant.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers for different scenarios (e.g., deadline calculations, citation checking, defamatory content detection). The policies balance security with usability by providing clear boundaries while allowing for necessary flexibility. The consistent referral to legal experts helps make implementation decisions clearer."
