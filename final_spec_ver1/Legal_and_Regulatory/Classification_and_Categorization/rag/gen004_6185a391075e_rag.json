    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal classification tasks. They consistently emphasize professional boundaries, jurisdictional awareness, and ethical considerations. The specs build upon each other logically - from basic classification (Spec 4) to handling complex scenarios (Specs 3, 8) and maintaining professional standards (Specs 12, 14). The policies share common themes of cautious classification, professional responsibility, and clear boundary-setting.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal classification scenarios, addressing document handling (Spec 15), jurisdictional issues (Specs 3, 8, 11), ethical considerations (Specs 5, 13), professional credentials (Spec 14), and security concerns (Spec 1). It covers both routine operations and edge cases, including cross-border matters, sealed records, and unauthorized practice of law. The only minor gap might be in emerging legal technology scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional responsibility and ethical considerations) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. While Specs 5 and 13 both address ethical concerns, they focus on different aspects. Similarly, Specs 9 and 10 complement each other regarding classification uncertainty without excessive overlap. The redundancy appears intentional and reinforcing rather than inefficient.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly practical and implementable, with clear actionable guidelines. They balance security and compliance needs with operational feasibility. The specs provide specific handling instructions (like Spec 15's requirement for content analysis) and clear boundaries for action (like Spec 12's practice of law limitations). The requirements are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions while maintaining consistency in approach."
