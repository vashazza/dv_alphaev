    "cohesion": "The specs form a well-integrated framework for legal content handling. Spec 1 (time-sensitive classifications) naturally flows into Spec 2 (citation validation), while Spec 3 (defamation detection) provides complementary risk management. They work together to create a comprehensive legal content validation pipeline without conflicts.",
    "coverage": "The group addresses major risk areas in legal content processing: temporal sensitivity, citation accuracy, and defamation risk. However, it could benefit from additional coverage of privacy/confidentiality concerns and jurisdictional boundary issues. The current specs focus primarily on content validation rather than complete legal risk management.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in validation processes. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal content processing, with complementary but non-duplicative verification steps. The multi-database validation requirement in Spec 2 provides good redundancy for critical citation checking.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., standardized uncertainty language, confidence scores). The human review component for defamation and the direction to legal counsel for specific deadlines show good balance between automation and expert oversight. The citation validation system may be complex to implement but remains feasible."
