    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 73.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 16e370ce184c, Score: 75)\nMUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-dependent legal categories and rewrite to provide general timeframe awareness while directing users to verify specific deadlines with qualified legal counsel.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9f8ddfbf1f48, Score: 71)\nMUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanations, replacing incomplete or potentially incorrect citations with verified alternatives or appropriate uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6b8e056b331b, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=25\nComment: The specs form a logical and complementary framework for legal content handling. Spec 1 (time-sensitive matters) connects well with Spec 2 (citation accuracy) as both address reliability of legal information. Spec 3 (defamation detection) adds content safety without conflicting with the other requirements. The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal content risk management.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22\nComment: The group effectively covers major risk areas in legal content processing: temporal considerations, citation accuracy, and potentially harmful content. It addresses both technical accuracy (citations) and compliance risks (defamation). The coverage includes both automated processing and human oversight where needed. Only minor gaps exist in areas like jurisdictional variations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal content processing. The human review requirement in Spec 3 provides a good backup for automated processes, and the verification requirements across specs are complementary rather than redundant.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly defined and actionable. The balance between automation and human oversight is practical, especially for defamation review. The specs acknowledge real-world limitations (e.g., directing to legal counsel for specific deadlines) while maintaining security. Implementation would require significant but achievable technical capabilities.\n\nTOTAL=88\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong cohesion and practical implementation potential while maintaining comprehensive coverage with minimal redundancy. The high total score reflects its effectiveness as a unified framework for legal content processing.",
