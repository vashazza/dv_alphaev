    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 49.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 16e370ce184c, Score: 75)\nMUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-dependent legal categories and rewrite to provide general timeframe awareness while directing users to verify specific deadlines with qualified legal counsel.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 334d83cc0c58, Score: N/A)\nMUST validate legal citations against multiple authoritative databases and append jurisdiction-specific confidence scores, replacing unverifiable references with standardized uncertainty language that preserves classification context.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6b8e056b331b, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=25\nComment: The specs form a well-integrated framework for legal content handling. Spec 1 (time-sensitive classifications) naturally flows into Spec 2 (citation validation), while Spec 3 (defamation detection) provides complementary risk management. They work together to create a comprehensive legal content validation pipeline without conflicts.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20\nComment: The group addresses major risk areas in legal content processing: temporal sensitivity, citation accuracy, and defamation risk. However, it could benefit from additional coverage of privacy/confidentiality concerns and jurisdictional boundary issues. The current specs focus primarily on content validation rather than complete legal risk management.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in validation processes. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal content processing, with complementary but non-duplicative verification steps. The multi-database validation requirement in Spec 2 provides good redundancy for critical citation checking.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., standardized uncertainty language, confidence scores). The human review component for defamation and the direction to legal counsel for specific deadlines show good balance between automation and expert oversight. The citation validation system may be complex to implement but remains feasible.\n\nTOTAL=86",
