    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 4 specs, Avg Score: 55.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 16e370ce184c, Score: 75)\nMUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-dependent legal categories and rewrite to provide general timeframe awareness while directing users to verify specific deadlines with qualified legal counsel.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9f8ddfbf1f48, Score: 71)\nMUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanations, replacing incomplete or potentially incorrect citations with verified alternatives or appropriate uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6b8e056b331b, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and quarantine potentially defamatory content in legal document classifications pending human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 6c2a19511079, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case participant names, and attorney-client privileged information when classifying legal documents or providing categorization explanations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework for legal document handling and classification. They logically progress from temporal considerations (Spec 1) through citation validation (Spec 2) to content safety (Spec 3) and privacy protection (Spec 4). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining clear boundaries between different types of legal concerns.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The policy group demonstrates strong coverage across key legal risk areas including time-sensitive matters, citation accuracy, defamation risks, and privacy protection. It addresses both content-level risks (defamation, PII) and process-level concerns (citations, deadlines). The only minor gap might be in handling jurisdictional variations in legal requirements.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal document handling, with complementary but non-duplicative requirements. The privacy and content review mechanisms (Specs 3 & 4) work together without excessive overlap.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., types of PII to mask, handling of citations). The policies balance security needs with practical usability by incorporating human review where needed and providing clear alternatives when exact information cannot be provided. The automated detection requirements are realistic and achievable.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThis is a particularly well-designed policy group for legal document handling, with strong cohesion and practical implementation guidance while maintaining comprehensive coverage of key risk areas.",
