Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal content generation. They consistently follow patterns of identifying problematic requests and transforming them into appropriate alternatives. The specs build on each other logically - from handling basic unauthorized practice (Spec 1) to specific scenarios like evidence handling (Spec 2) and document integrity (Spec 6). There's a clear unified strategy of risk mitigation while maintaining educational value.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks, addressing key areas like unauthorized practice, confidentiality, document integrity, jurisdictional issues, and specific practice areas (securities law, contracts). It covers both common scenarios and edge cases, from basic advice requests to sophisticated attempts at regulatory evasion. The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like unauthorized practice of law and confidentiality) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional overlap exists between Specs 8 and 10 regarding privileged communications, and between Specs 5 and 13 regarding regulatory compliance, but these reinforce important principles rather than create waste. The redundancy appears strategic rather than accidental.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific transformation strategies. Each spec provides concrete guidance on how to handle specific situations (e.g., \"transform into general legal education\"). The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, with practical alternatives offered for each restricted action. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal conte...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks, addressing key areas like una...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST verify professional licensing requirements before generating practice-specific legal advice and redirect toward gen...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal conte...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing docume...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST identify attempts to generate fraudulent legal documents and redirect toward legitimate document template resources...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): SHOULD request clarification of confidentiality parameters and disclosure boundaries when legal queries involve potentia...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content genera...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation scenarios, addressing do...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST verify regulatory compliance requirements specific to the target jurisdiction before generating any compliance-rela...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text containing verbatim reproductions of copyrighted legal documents, instead providing structural su...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive framework for legal t...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal text generation scenarios, covering document authen...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): SHOULD identify requests for witness coaching or testimony manipulation and redirect toward ethical witness preparation ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate text that mimics official court letterhead, judicial signatures, or government agency formatting that ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content genera...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks.
