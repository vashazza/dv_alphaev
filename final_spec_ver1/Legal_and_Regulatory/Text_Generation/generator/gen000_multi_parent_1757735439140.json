Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive framework for legal text generation. They flow naturally from identification (Specs 1,8) through handling (Specs 3,4,9) to output management (Specs 2,12). The policies work together to maintain professional boundaries while preserving educational value. There's a clear progression from input analysis to content transformation to safe output generation.. Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal text generation scenarios, covering document authenticity (Spec 2), confidentiality (Specs 3,12), professional boundaries (Specs 6,11), jurisdictional issues (Spec 5), and various types of legal content (Specs 4,7,9,10). The coverage includes both common scenarios and edge cases like adversarial prompts (Spec 8) and privileged information (Spec 10).. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between Specs 6 and 11 regarding attorney-client relationships, and between Specs 3 and 10 regarding privileged information, this redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for these critical areas. The remaining specs are efficiently distinct while maintaining necessary connections. The overlap serves to reinforce important boundaries rather than create unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with educational value and user intent. The specs provide concrete mechanisms for handling various scenarios (e.g., transforming requests, inserting disclaimers, masking PII) while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions and contexts. The automatic detection and transformation requirements are realistic and implementable..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content genera...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing doc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST verify regulatory compliance requirements specific to the target jurisdiction before generating any compliance-rela...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text containing verbatim reproductions of copyrighted legal documents, instead providing structural su...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal conte...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks, addressing key areas like una...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST verify professional licensing requirements before generating practice-specific legal advice and redirect toward gen...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal conte...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks, addressing key areas like una...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST verify professional licensing requirements before generating practice-specific legal advice and redirect toward gen...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive framework for legal t...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal text generation scenarios, covering document authen...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): SHOULD identify requests for witness coaching or testimony manipulation and redirect toward ethical witness preparation ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate text that mimics official court letterhead, judicial signatures, or government agency formatting that ...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive framework for legal text generation.
