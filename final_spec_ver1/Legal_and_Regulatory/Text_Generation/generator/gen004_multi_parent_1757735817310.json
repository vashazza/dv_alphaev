  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content generation. They consistently build upon each other, from jurisdiction verification (Specs 1,5) to content transformation (Specs 3,8,15) to temporal accuracy (Specs 10,13). The specs maintain a consistent approach to risk mitigation through verification, transformation, and appropriate disclaimers.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing document authenticity, jurisdictional compliance, temporal validity, confidentiality, and unauthorized practice of law. It covers both common scenarios (contract clauses, legal opinions) and edge cases (defamation, settlement terms). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (verification requirements, transformation of inappropriate requests) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional reinforcement exists between specs (e.g., 7,14,15 regarding legal advice limitations), but this serves to strengthen the framework rather than create inefficiency.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actions and specific transformation patterns. Each spec provides actionable guidance while maintaining flexibility for different contexts. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, particularly in how potentially problematic requests are transformed into educational content rather than simply blocked..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content genera...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing docume...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST verify regulatory compliance requirements specific to the target jurisdiction before generating any compliance-rela...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text containing verbatim reproductions of copyrighted legal documents, instead providing structural su...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework for legal text genera...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group comprehensively covers major legal compliance risks including unauthorized practice...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): SHOULD identify requests for witness coaching or testimony manipulation and redirect toward ethical witness preparation ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate text that mimics official court letterhead, judicial signatures, or government agency formatting that ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content genera...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing unauth...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST verify professional licensing requirements before generating practice-specific legal advice and redirect toward gen...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal c...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal content generation scenarios, including contract la...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST preserve evidentiary integrity by avoiding alterations to quoted legal materials while clearly distinguishing comme...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text containing specific statutory interpretations or regulatory guidance without transforming such re...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 85/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework addressing legal content generation.
