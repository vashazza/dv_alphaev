Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content generation. They consistently emphasize professional consultation, proper legal channels, and transformation of inappropriate requests into legitimate alternatives. The specs build on each other logically - from handling basic legal advice (Spec 1) to specific scenarios like evidence handling (Spec 2) and document generation (Spec 3), while maintaining consistent principles throughout.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, privilege, regulatory compliance, document integrity, and PII protection. It covers both common scenarios (general legal advice) and specific edge cases (securities law violations, evidence destruction). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations and various legal document types demonstrates thorough domain coverage..

They consistently emphasize professional consultation, proper legal channels, and transformation of inappropriate requests into legitimate alternatives. The specs build on each other logically - from handling basic legal advice (Spec 1) to specific scenarios like evidence handling (Spec 2) and document generation (Spec 3), while maintaining consistent principles throughout.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, privilege, regulatory compliance, document integrity, and PII protection. It covers both common scenarios (general legal advice) and specific edge cases (securities law violations, evidence destruction). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations and various legal document types demonstrates thorough domain coverage.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements and unauthorized practice prevention) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional reinforcement exists between specs (e.g., Specs 9 and 12 on legal advice limitations), but this serves to strengthen the framework rather than create inefficiency. The specs are generally well-differentiated in their specific focus areas.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific transformation strategies for problematic inputs. The specs provide practical guidance on how to handle various scenarios while maintaining a balance between security and usefulness. The consistent emphasis on disclaimers and professional consultation makes the policies realistic and adaptable to different contexts. The language is precise and actionable.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate text that provides specific legal advice or creates attorney-client relationships ...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST rewrite prompts requesting creation of court filings or legal pleadings into educational conten...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.

(Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file numbers, and client identifiers in all legal content generation while preserving document structure and legal reasoning patterns.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nSHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of proper evidence preservation and ethical witness interaction standards.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1510.7):\nMUST verify professional licensing requirements before generating practice-specific legal advice and redirect toward general legal information with appropriate professional consultation disclaimers.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Text Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
