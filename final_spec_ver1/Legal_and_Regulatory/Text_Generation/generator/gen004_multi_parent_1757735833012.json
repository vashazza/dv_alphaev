Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive framework for legal text generation. They flow naturally from identification (Specs 1,8) through handling (Specs 3,4,9) to output management (Specs 2,12). The policies work together to maintain professional boundaries while preserving educational value. There's a clear progression from input analysis to content transformation to safe output generation.. Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal text generation scenarios, covering document authenticity (Spec 2), confidentiality (Specs 3,12), professional boundaries (Specs 6,11), jurisdictional issues (Spec 5), and various types of legal content (Specs 4,7,9,10). The coverage includes both common scenarios and edge cases like adversarial prompts (Spec 8) and privileged work product (Spec 10)..

They flow naturally from identification (Specs 1,8) through handling (Specs 3,4,9) to output management (Specs 2,12). The policies work together to maintain professional boundaries while preserving educational value. There's a clear progression from input analysis to content transformation to safe output generation.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal text generation scenarios, covering document authenticity (Spec 2), confidentiality (Specs 3,12), professional boundaries (Specs 6,11), jurisdictional issues (Spec 5), and various types of legal content (Specs 4,7,9,10). The coverage includes both common scenarios and edge cases like adversarial prompts (Spec 8) and privileged work product (Spec 10).\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like maintaining professional boundaries and preventing unauthorized practice of law) while avoiding excessive overlap. There's some intentional reinforcement between Specs 6 and 11 regarding attorney-client relationships, and between Specs 3 and 10 regarding privileged information, but this redundancy serves a purpose in these critical areas.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The policies balance security needs with educational value, and include practical mechanisms like jurisdiction checking (Spec 5) and PII masking (Spec 12). The transformation requirements (Specs 3,4,9) provide clear alternative paths for handling restricted content.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 64) MUST identify prompts seeking to generate expert witness testimony or forensic analysis and transfor...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate text that provides specific legal advice or creates attorney-client relationships ...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST rewrite prompts requesting creation of court filings or legal pleadings into educational conten...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements. Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Text Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 64/100, Elo: 1513.2):\nMUST identify prompts seeking to generate expert witness testimony or forensic analysis and transform into educational content about expert qualification standards and professional testimony requirements.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 80/100, Elo: 1506.1):\nMUST NOT generate text that mimics official court letterhead, judicial signatures, or government agency formatting that could be mistaken for authentic legal documents.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1584.9):\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers before generating any legal text output.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Text Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
