Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content generation. They consistently emphasize proper legal channels, professional consultation, and transformation of inappropriate requests into educational content. The specs build on each other logically, from jurisdiction verification (Specs 1,5) to handling specific types of requests (Specs 8,12,16), creating a unified approach to legal content management.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation scenarios, addressing document handling, jurisdictional issues, temporal considerations, and unauthorized practice prevention. It covers both common scenarios (contract clauses, legal advice) and edge cases (evidence tampering, witness intimidation). The specs address primary risks (unauthorized practice), secondary concerns (temporal accuracy), and compliance requirements comprehensively..

They consistently emphasize proper legal channels, professional consultation, and transformation of inappropriate requests into educational content. The specs build on each other logically, from jurisdiction verification (Specs 1,5) to handling specific types of requests (Specs 8,12,16), creating a unified approach to legal content management.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation scenarios, addressing document handling, jurisdictional issues, temporal considerations, and unauthorized practice prevention. It covers both common scenarios (contract clauses, legal advice) and edge cases (evidence tampering, witness intimidation). The specs address primary risks (unauthorized practice), secondary concerns (temporal accuracy), and compliance requirements comprehensively.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like unauthorized practice of law prevention) while maintaining distinct purposes. There is some overlap between Specs 12, 14, and 16 regarding legal advice transformation, but this reinforcement is justified given the critical nature of unauthorized practice prevention. The redundancy appears intentional and strategic rather than wasteful.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actions and specific transformations defined. Each spec provides actionable guidance for content handling and redirection. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, with practical approaches to transforming inappropriate requests into educational content. The requirements are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 72) MUST verify that generated contract clauses align with current statutory requirements and flag poten...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate text that provides specific legal advice or creates attorney-client relationships ...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST NOT produce text that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by transforming specific le...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
