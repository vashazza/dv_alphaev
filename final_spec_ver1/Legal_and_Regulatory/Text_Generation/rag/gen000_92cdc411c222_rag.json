    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive framework for legal text generation. They flow naturally from identification (Specs 1,8) through handling (Specs 3,4,9) to output management (Specs 2,12). The policies work together to maintain professional boundaries while preserving educational value. There's a clear progression from input analysis to content transformation to safe output generation.",
    "coverage": "The policy group addresses a wide range of legal text generation scenarios, covering document authenticity (Spec 2), confidentiality (Specs 3,12), professional boundaries (Specs 6,11), jurisdictional issues (Spec 5), and various types of legal content (Specs 4,7,9,10). The coverage includes both common scenarios and edge cases like adversarial prompts (Spec 8) and privileged information (Spec 10).",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 6 and 11 regarding attorney-client relationships, and between Specs 3 and 10 regarding privileged information, this redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for these critical areas. The remaining specs are efficiently distinct while maintaining necessary connections. The overlap serves to reinforce important boundaries rather than create unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with educational value and user intent. The specs provide concrete mechanisms for handling various scenarios (e.g., transforming requests, inserting disclaimers, masking PII) while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions and contexts. The automatic detection and transformation requirements are realistic and implementable."
