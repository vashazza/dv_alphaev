    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework for legal text generation. They flow naturally from authentication (Spec 7) through content generation (Specs 1-4, 9) to privacy protection (Specs 12-13). The specs consistently emphasize transforming inappropriate requests into educational content while maintaining professional boundaries and legal compliance.",
    "coverage": "The policy group comprehensively covers major legal risk areas including unauthorized practice of law, document authenticity, confidentiality, jurisdictional issues, and privacy protection. It addresses both direct risks (fake documents, unauthorized advice) and subtle scenarios (witness coaching, privileged work product). The coverage of different user interaction patterns and potential misuse cases is thorough.",
    "redundancy": "While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is notable redundancy between Specs 12 and 13 regarding PII masking. Some overlap exists between Specs 6 and 11 regarding attorney-client relationships, though this redundancy may be intentional for such a critical issue. The group could benefit from consolidating these overlapping requirements while maintaining their protective intent.",
    "practicality": "The specs are clearly written and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security with educational value by consistently transforming prohibited requests into acceptable alternatives. The requirements for jurisdiction checking (Spec 5) and authentication (Spec 7) may require careful implementation to maintain usability, but overall the specs are realistic and implementable."
