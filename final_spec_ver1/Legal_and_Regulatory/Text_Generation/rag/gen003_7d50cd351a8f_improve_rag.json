    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework for legal text generation. They flow naturally from identification (Specs 1,8) through verification (Specs 5,7) to appropriate transformation/output (Specs 3,9,11). The policies work together to maintain professional boundaries while preserving educational value. There's a clear progression from input analysis to output modification that creates a robust safety chain.",
    "coverage": "The policy group comprehensively covers major legal compliance risks including unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, document authenticity, and privileged information. It addresses various scenarios from document generation to legal advice and expert testimony. The inclusion of both obvious risks (court document forgery) and subtle ones (inadvertent attorney-client relationships) shows thorough domain coverage. The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized legal practice) while maintaining distinct purposes. There's some overlap between Specs 6 and 11 regarding attorney-client relationships, and between Specs 3 and 10 regarding privileged information, but these reinforce important safety aspects rather than create waste. The redundancy appears intentional and protective rather than inefficient.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementation-ready. Each spec provides specific triggers and transformations that can be programmatically implemented. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained by transforming restricted content into educational materials rather than simply blocking it. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions."
