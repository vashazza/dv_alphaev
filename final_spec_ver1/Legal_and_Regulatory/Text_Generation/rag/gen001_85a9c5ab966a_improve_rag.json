  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content generation. They consistently emphasize proper legal channels, professional consultation, and transformation of inappropriate requests into educational content. The specs build on each other logically, from jurisdiction verification (Specs 1,5) to handling specific types of requests (Specs 8,12,16), creating a unified approach to legal content management.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation scenarios, addressing document handling, jurisdictional issues, temporal considerations, and unauthorized practice prevention. It covers both common scenarios (contract clauses, legal advice) and edge cases (evidence tampering, witness intimidation). The specs address primary risks (unauthorized practice), secondary concerns (temporal accuracy), and compliance requirements comprehensively.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like unauthorized practice of law prevention) while maintaining distinct purposes. There is some overlap between Specs 12, 14, and 16 regarding legal advice transformation, but this reinforcement is justified given the critical nature of unauthorized practice prevention. The redundancy appears intentional and strategic rather than wasteful.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actions and specific transformations defined. Each spec provides actionable guidance for content handling and redirection. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, with practical approaches to transforming inappropriate requests into educational content. The requirements are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions."
