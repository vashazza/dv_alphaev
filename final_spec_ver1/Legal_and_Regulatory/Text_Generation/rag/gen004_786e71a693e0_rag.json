  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content generation. They consistently build upon each other, from jurisdiction verification (Specs 1,5) to content transformation (Specs 3,8,15) to temporal accuracy (Specs 10,13). The specs maintain a consistent approach to risk mitigation through verification, transformation, and appropriate disclaimers.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing document authenticity, jurisdictional compliance, temporal validity, confidentiality, and unauthorized practice of law. It covers both common scenarios (contract clauses, legal opinions) and edge cases (defamation, settlement terms). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (verification requirements, transformation of inappropriate requests) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional reinforcement exists between specs (e.g., 7,14,15 regarding legal advice limitations), but this serves to strengthen the framework rather than create inefficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actions and specific transformation patterns. Each spec provides actionable guidance while maintaining flexibility for different contexts. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, particularly in how potentially problematic requests are transformed into educational content rather than simply blocked."
