    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal content generation. They consistently emphasize professional consultation, proper legal channels, and transformation of inappropriate requests into legitimate alternatives. The specs build on each other logically - from handling basic legal advice (Spec 1) to specific scenarios like evidence handling (Spec 2) and document generation (Spec 3), while maintaining consistent principles throughout.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal content generation risks, addressing unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, privilege, regulatory compliance, document integrity, and PII protection. It covers both common scenarios (general legal advice) and specific edge cases (securities law violations, evidence destruction). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations and various legal document types demonstrates thorough domain coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements and unauthorized practice prevention) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional reinforcement exists between specs (e.g., Specs 9 and 12 on legal advice limitations), but this serves to strengthen the framework rather than create inefficiency. The specs are generally well-differentiated in their specific focus areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific transformation strategies for problematic inputs. The specs provide practical guidance on how to handle various scenarios while maintaining a balance between security and usefulness. The consistent emphasis on disclaimers and professional consultation makes the policies realistic and adaptable to different contexts. The language is precise and actionable."
