    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive framework for legal text generation. They flow naturally from identification (Specs 1,8) through handling (Specs 3,4,9) to output management (Specs 2,12). The policies work together to maintain professional boundaries while preserving educational value. There's a clear progression from input analysis to content transformation to safe output generation.",
    "coverage": "The policy group addresses a wide range of legal text generation scenarios, covering document authenticity (Spec 2), confidentiality (Specs 3,12), professional boundaries (Specs 6,11), jurisdictional issues (Spec 5), and various types of legal content (Specs 4,7,9,10). The coverage includes both common scenarios and edge cases like adversarial prompts (Spec 8) and privileged work product (Spec 10).",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like maintaining professional boundaries and preventing unauthorized practice of law) while avoiding excessive overlap. There's some intentional reinforcement between Specs 6 and 11 regarding attorney-client relationships, and between Specs 3 and 10 regarding privileged information, but this redundancy serves a purpose in these critical areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The policies balance security needs with educational value, and include practical mechanisms like jurisdiction checking (Spec 5) and PII masking (Spec 12). The transformation requirements (Specs 3,4,9) provide clear alternative paths for handling restricted content."
