  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 6-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance and information handling. They progress logically from handling sensitive materials (Spec 1) through various aspects of legal content generation (Specs 2-4) to information segregation (Spec 6). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal practice while maintaining professional standards.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates strong coverage of key legal/regulatory risks, addressing document handling, unauthorized practice of law, legal interpretation limitations, and confidentiality requirements. It covers both direct risks (unauthorized practice) and indirect risks (incomplete data handling). The only minor gap might be in addressing cross-jurisdictional scenarios more explicitly.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized legal practice) while maintaining distinct focuses. Specs 4 and 5 have some overlap in handling uncertain/incomplete information, but the overlap appears intentional for reinforcing critical safety measures. The redundancy is generally purposeful rather than wasteful.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical usage by allowing for educational summaries and conditional analyses rather than outright prohibitions. The information segregation protocols and disclaimer requirements are specific enough to implement while remaining flexible for different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for legal...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across key legal processing domains including PII pro...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participa...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT process sealed settlement agreements or confidential arbitration awards without explicit authorization verifica...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal inform...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across key legal and regulatory concerns, addressing ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participa...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT process sealed settlement agreements or confidential arbitration awards without explicit authorization verifica...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for legal...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set demonstrates thorough coverage across critical legal processing domains: PII protecti...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participa...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT process sealed settlement agreements or confidential arbitration awards without explicit authorization verifica...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal informat...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set provides excellent coverage across multiple aspects of legal information processing, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal document...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides excellent coverage across multiple critical areas including evidence handl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 88/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal informat...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group provides comprehensive coverage of critical legal/regulatory concerns, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attr...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance and information handling.
