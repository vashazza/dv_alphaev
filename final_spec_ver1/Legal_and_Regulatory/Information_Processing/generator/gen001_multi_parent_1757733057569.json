  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 17-spec group. Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal information processing. They consistently address key themes like evidentiary integrity (Specs 1,2,8), professional licensing (Specs 3,5), and maintaining boundaries between information and advice (Specs 6,16). The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal document handling while maintaining professional standards.. Coverage: The policy set provides excellent coverage across multiple aspects of legal information processing, including evidence handling, jurisdictional considerations, professional licensing, privilege protection, and PII management. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (bias detection), and edge cases (multi-jurisdictional issues). The inclusion of Spec 17 for PII protection rounds out the comprehensive coverage..

They consistently address key themes like evidentiary integrity (Specs 1,2,8), professional licensing (Specs 3,5), and maintaining boundaries between information and advice (Specs 6,16). The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal document handling while maintaining professional standards.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set provides excellent coverage across multiple aspects of legal information processing, including evidence handling, jurisdictional considerations, professional licensing, privilege protection, and PII management. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (bias detection), and edge cases (multi-jurisdictional issues). The inclusion of Spec 17 for PII protection rounds out the comprehensive coverage.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some intentional overlap in evidence handling requirements (Specs 1,2,8) which provides appropriate redundancy for this critical area. However, there could be some consolidation of similar requirements, particularly around jurisdictional verification (Specs 9,10,13) and legal advice boundaries (Specs 6,16). The redundancy generally serves a purpose but could be slightly more efficient.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific verification steps and concrete boundaries. The policies balance security needs with practical implementation, particularly in areas like PII detection and privilege protection. The layered approach to regulatory information (Spec 15) demonstrates good usability consideration. The main challenge might be maintaining current databases for verification requirements.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 65) SHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation m...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
