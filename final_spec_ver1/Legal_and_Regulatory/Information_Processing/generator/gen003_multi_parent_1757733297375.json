Average group score: 88.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance, privacy protection, and ethical boundaries. They logically build upon each other, with clear relationships between data protection (Specs 1,8,16), ethical constraints (Specs 6,7,9,12), and information processing requirements (Specs 3,4,10,14). The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal information handling.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key legal and regulatory concerns, including PII protection, bias detection, ethical compliance, document handling, and regulatory interpretation. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (bias detection), and edge cases (adversarial prompts, prompt injection). The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional considerations.. Target Spec: MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...

They logically build upon each other, with clear relationships between data protection (Specs 1,8,16), ethical constraints (Specs 6,7,9,12), and information processing requirements (Specs 3,4,10,14). The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal information handling.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key legal and regulatory concerns, including PII protection, bias detection, ethical compliance, document handling, and regulatory interpretation. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (bias detection), and edge cases (adversarial prompts, prompt injection). The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional considerations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is some notable redundancy - Specs 1 and 17 are identical, and there's partial overlap between bias detection specs (2 and 13). However, some redundancy appears intentional for critical areas like PII protection and ethical boundaries, providing appropriate emphasis without excessive duplication.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific requirements that can be implemented in real-world systems. They balance security needs with usability by providing layered approaches (Spec 14) and educational alternatives (Spec 5). The requirements for detecting bias, masking PII, and handling regulatory content are technically feasible with current technology.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST preserve ethical boundaries by detecting requests for assistance with potentially fraudulent do...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST NOT synthesize legal conclusions by combining partial information from multiple unverified sour...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
