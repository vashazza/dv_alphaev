  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 7-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal information processing safeguards. They logically progress from data detection (Spec 1, 7) through processing restrictions (Specs 2-5) to information handling protocols (Spec 6). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal practice while maintaining appropriate information handling.. Coverage: Excellent coverage across key legal/regulatory risks including: confidential materials (1,6,7), unauthorized practice of law (2,3), legal interpretation limitations (4,5), and data privacy (7). The specs address both input validation, processing rules, and output requirements. The only minor gap might be in cross-border/jurisdictional scenarios beyond the initial jurisdiction check.. Redundancy: The specs show strategic redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized legal practice - Specs 2,3,5) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. Specs 4 and 5 have some overlap in handling uncertain interpretations, but this reinforces important principles. The information protection requirements (Specs 1,6,7) complement each other without excessive overlap.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical usage by allowing conditional analyses with appropriate disclaimers rather than complete restrictions. The automated detection requirements (Specs 1,7) may require sophisticated implementation but are feasible with current technology..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for legal...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set demonstrates thorough coverage across critical legal processing domains: PII protecti...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participa...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT process sealed settlement agreements or confidential arbitration awards without explicit authorization verifica...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, particularly around evidence handling, legal ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set provides comprehensive coverage of major legal processing risks, including evidence h...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attr...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 88/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance, privacy protection, and ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key legal and regulatory concerns, including...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participa...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): SHOULD detect bias in legal precedent selection by ensuring representation across diverse judicial perspectives and demo...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 88/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal informat...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group provides comprehensive coverage of critical legal/regulatory concerns, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attr...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance, data protection, and ethical...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates comprehensive coverage of key legal/regulatory concerns including PII ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participa...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): SHOULD detect bias in legal precedent selection by ensuring representation across diverse judicial perspectives and demo...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal document processing and compliance.
