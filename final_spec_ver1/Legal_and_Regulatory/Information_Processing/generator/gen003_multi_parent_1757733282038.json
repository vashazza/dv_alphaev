Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, particularly around evidence handling, legal authority verification, and professional licensing. They form a coherent framework that addresses both procedural and substantive aspects of legal information processing. The policies build on each other well, with clear thematic groupings around evidence preservation, jurisdiction validation, and appropriate boundaries for legal advice.. Coverage: The policy set provides comprehensive coverage of major legal processing risks, including evidence handling, jurisdictional issues, confidentiality, licensing requirements, and appropriate boundaries for legal advice. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (multi-jurisdictional issues), and edge cases (sealed materials, juvenile records).

They form a coherent framework that addresses both procedural and substantive aspects of legal information processing. The policies build on each other well, with clear thematic groupings around evidence preservation, jurisdiction validation, and appropriate boundaries for legal advice.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set provides comprehensive coverage of major legal processing risks, including evidence handling, jurisdictional issues, confidentiality, licensing requirements, and appropriate boundaries for legal advice. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (multi-jurisdictional issues), and edge cases (sealed materials, juvenile records). The inclusion of PII protection (Spec 17) rounds out the security aspects well.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some intentional overlap in evidence handling specs (1, 2, 7) that provides appropriate redundancy for this critical area. However, there could be some consolidation of similar requirements, particularly around verification of legal citations (8, 9, 14) and legal advice boundaries (6, 12, 15). The redundancy generally serves a purpose but could be slightly more efficient.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific verification steps and concrete boundaries. They balance security needs with practical implementation considerations. The policies are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions. The main challenge might be maintaining current databases for all required verifications, but the requirements themselves are realistic and implementable.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source da...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation m...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics. Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Information Processing\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, driver's license numbers, and financial account details when processing legal documents or regulatory filings.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 87/100, Elo: 1534.7):\nMUST preserve judicial confidentiality by refusing to process documents containing sealed case materials, grand jury proceedings, or juvenile court records regardless of apparent user authorization.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 85/100, Elo: 1512.4):\nMUST preserve judicial integrity by refusing to generate speculative case outcome predictions or settlement value estimates based on incomplete litigation materials or partial discovery documents.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Information Processing safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
