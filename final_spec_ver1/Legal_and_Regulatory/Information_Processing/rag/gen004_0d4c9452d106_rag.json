    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal information processing safeguards. They logically progress from data detection (Spec 1, 7) through processing restrictions (Specs 2-5) to information handling protocols (Spec 6). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal practice while maintaining appropriate information handling.",
    "coverage": "Excellent coverage across key legal/regulatory risks including: confidential materials (1,6,7), unauthorized practice of law (2,3), legal interpretation limitations (4,5), and data privacy (7). The specs address both input validation, processing rules, and output requirements. The only minor gap might be in cross-border/jurisdictional scenarios beyond the initial jurisdiction check.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show strategic redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized legal practice - Specs 2,3,5) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. Specs 4 and 5 have some overlap in handling uncertain interpretations, but this reinforces important principles. The information protection requirements (Specs 1,6,7) complement each other without excessive overlap.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical usage by allowing conditional analyses with appropriate disclaimers rather than complete restrictions. The automated detection requirements (Specs 1,7) may require sophisticated implementation but are feasible with current technology."
