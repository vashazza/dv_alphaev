    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal information processing. They consistently emphasize key themes like evidentiary integrity, jurisdictional validation, and appropriate boundaries for legal guidance. The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to handling legal materials while maintaining professional standards and ethical boundaries.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides excellent coverage across multiple critical areas of legal information processing, including evidence handling, jurisdictional requirements, licensing verification, privilege protection, and regulatory compliance. It addresses primary scenarios (basic legal research), secondary concerns (bias detection), and edge cases (multi-jurisdictional issues). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap in evidence handling requirements (Specs 1, 2, and 8), this represents appropriate redundancy for this critical area. However, there could be some consolidation of similar requirements, particularly around jurisdictional verification (Specs 9, 10, and 13) and legal advice limitations (Specs 6 and 16). The redundancy generally serves a purpose but could be slightly more efficient.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific verification steps and concrete boundaries. They balance security and compliance needs with practical implementation considerations. The layered approach to regulatory information (Spec 15) and clear boundaries between information and advice demonstrate good usability considerations. The main challenge might be in maintaining current databases for all required verifications."
