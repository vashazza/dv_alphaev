    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, particularly around evidence handling, legal authority verification, and professional licensing. They form a coherent framework that addresses both procedural and substantive aspects of legal information processing. The policies build on each other well, with clear thematic groupings around evidence preservation, jurisdiction validation, and appropriate boundaries for legal advice.",
    "coverage": "The policy set provides comprehensive coverage of major legal processing risks, including evidence handling, jurisdictional issues, confidentiality, licensing requirements, and appropriate boundaries for legal advice. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (multi-jurisdictional issues), and edge cases (sealed materials, juvenile records). The inclusion of PII protection (Spec 17) rounds out the security aspects well.",
    "redundancy": "There is some intentional overlap in evidence handling specs (1, 2, 7) that provides appropriate redundancy for this critical area. However, there could be some consolidation of similar requirements, particularly around verification of legal citations (8, 9, 14) and legal advice boundaries (6, 12, 15). The redundancy generally serves a purpose but could be slightly more efficient.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific verification steps and concrete boundaries. They balance security needs with practical implementation considerations. The policies are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions. The main challenge might be maintaining current databases for all required verifications, but the requirements themselves are realistic and implementable."
