  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework for legal information processing. They consistently emphasize key legal principles like maintaining evidentiary integrity (Specs 1, 5), avoiding unauthorized legal advice (Specs 3, 12), and proper handling of jurisdictional considerations (Specs 6, 7, 9). The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal document handling while maintaining professional boundaries.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides excellent coverage across critical legal processing areas including evidence handling, jurisdictional considerations, privilege protection, bias detection, and regulatory compliance. It addresses both primary concerns (like evidence handling) and secondary considerations (like bias detection). The inclusion of PII protection (Spec 13) and privileged communications handling (Spec 10) shows attention to important edge cases.",
    "redundancy": "There are several instances of exact duplication (Specs 14/8, 15/11, 16/4, 17/10) which unnecessarily inflate the policy count. However, there is appropriate reinforcement of critical concepts across different contexts (like multiple specs addressing evidence handling and legal advice boundaries) where such overlap serves a purpose. The redundancy could be better managed while maintaining the essential safety nets.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are clearly written and provide actionable guidance for implementation. They balance security requirements with practical usability considerations, such as allowing for document structure preservation while handling privileged content (Spec 10). The requirements for verification against authoritative sources (Specs 2, 6, 7) are specific and implementable. The layered approach to regulatory information (Spec 11) demonstrates good awareness of real-world usage needs."
