    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance and information handling. They progress logically from handling sensitive materials (Spec 1) through various aspects of legal content generation (Specs 2-4) to information segregation (Spec 6). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal practice while maintaining professional standards.",
    "coverage": "The policy group demonstrates strong coverage of key legal/regulatory risks, addressing document handling, unauthorized practice of law, legal interpretation limitations, and confidentiality requirements. It covers both direct risks (unauthorized practice) and indirect risks (incomplete data handling). The only minor gap might be in addressing cross-jurisdictional scenarios more explicitly.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized legal practice) while maintaining distinct focuses. Specs 4 and 5 have some overlap in handling uncertain/incomplete information, but the overlap appears intentional for reinforcing critical safety measures. The redundancy is generally purposeful rather than wasteful.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical usage by allowing for educational summaries and conditional analyses rather than outright prohibitions. The information segregation protocols and disclaimer requirements are specific enough to implement while remaining flexible for different contexts."
