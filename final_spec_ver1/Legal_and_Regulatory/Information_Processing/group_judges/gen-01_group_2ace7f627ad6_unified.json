    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 6 specs, Avg Score: 79.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 357900c83ad2, Score: 82)\nMUST detect and refuse processing of materials containing grand jury transcripts, sealed indictments, or classified government documents regardless of user-claimed authorization levels.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9e79f42b2164, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate legal document templates without first clarifying specific use case, jurisdiction, and professional oversight availability to prevent unauthorized practice concerns.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 4da9b9a7b138, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by rewriting legal advice requests into educational summaries with appropriate disclaimers directing users to qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c71398cab736, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate definitive legal interpretations when source materials contain conflicting statutory provisions or contradictory case holdings, instead presenting alternative readings with uncertainty qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8ee2d28a1910, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate binding legal opinions or definitive compliance determinations when processing incomplete regulatory datasets, instead providing conditional analysis with explicit data limitation disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 15c56b28b1cb, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT combine confidential information from multiple client matters or regulatory proceedings when generating comparative legal analyses, maintaining strict information segregation protocols.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal information processing safeguards. They logically progress from handling sensitive materials (Spec 1) through document generation (Spec 2), advice handling (Spec 3), interpretation limitations (Specs 4-5), and data segregation (Spec 6). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal practice while maintaining professional standards.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The policy group demonstrates strong coverage of key legal/regulatory risks, addressing document handling, practice limitations, interpretation boundaries, and confidentiality requirements. It covers both direct risks (unauthorized practice) and indirect risks (incomplete/conflicting information handling). The only minor gap might be in addressing cross-jurisdictional scenarios beyond the basic jurisdiction check in Spec 2.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized practice of law) while maintaining distinct focuses. Specs 4 and 5 have some overlap in handling uncertain/incomplete information, but their specific applications (statutory interpretation vs. compliance determination) justify the separation. The redundancy appears intentional and reinforcing rather than wasteful.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., \"rewriting into educational summaries,\" \"presenting alternative readings,\" \"explicit data limitation disclosures\"). The policies balance security with usability by offering alternative approaches rather than just prohibitions. The framework appears adaptable to different legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards.\n\nTOTAL=91",
