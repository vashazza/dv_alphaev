    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 81.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8a8e3dc6b57b, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in ways that could affect interpretation or admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 6d65e8d056e0, Score: 76)\nMUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attribution and avoiding content modification that could affect admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e4e7d6162412, Score: 84)\nMUST verify professional licensing requirements are met before processing requests for jurisdiction-specific legal practice guidance and redirect unlicensed individuals to appropriate resources.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f7eb31074a1c, Score: 81)\nMUST verify that case law precedents cited in legal research outputs remain good law by checking for subsequent appeals, reversals, or distinguishing decisions before presenting them as binding authority.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ab6690120f48, Score: 84)\nMUST validate professional licensing status by cross-checking attorney bar numbers and regulatory practitioner credentials against current licensing databases before processing professional service agreements.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: acfb81728c7a, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation materials, instead offering general informational context and suggesting consultation with qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 093aeefea465, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by refusing to alter, summarize, or paraphrase materials explicitly designated as evidence without maintaining clear attribution to original sources and modification tracking.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source databases and flag inconsistencies with jurisdiction-specific disclaimers when synthesizing compliance guidance across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 22130c0177e4, Score: 80)\nMUST verify jurisdiction-specific statutory citations against authoritative legal databases before including them in synthesized regulatory summaries.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8224e024a55e, Score: 85)\nMUST preserve judicial integrity by refusing to generate speculative case outcome predictions or settlement value estimates based on incomplete litigation materials or partial discovery documents.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 08dec3e88b31, Score: 77)\nMUST verify court jurisdiction accuracy when processing multi-state legal research by validating territorial authority and applicable law before presenting jurisdictional analyses.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ef0ad82938ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate legal advice or specific recommendations when processing contract analysis requests, instead providing factual observations and directing users to consult qualified legal counsel for interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8224e024a55e, Score: 85)\nMUST preserve judicial integrity by refusing to generate speculative case outcome predictions or settlement value estimates based on incomplete litigation materials or partial discovery documents.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: e4e7d6162412, Score: 84)\nMUST verify professional licensing requirements are met before processing requests for jurisdiction-specific legal practice guidance and redirect unlicensed individuals to appropriate resources.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ab6690120f48, Score: 84)\nMUST validate professional licensing status by cross-checking attorney bar numbers and regulatory practitioner credentials against current licensing databases before processing professional service agreements.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 8a8e3dc6b57b, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in ways that could affect interpretation or admissibility.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "I'll evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a coherent framework around legal information processing. They consistently address key themes like evidentiary integrity, jurisdictional validation, and professional licensing requirements. The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal data handling while maintaining appropriate boundaries between information processing and legal advice.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The policy group provides excellent coverage of major legal processing scenarios, including evidence handling, jurisdictional requirements, professional licensing, case law validation, and contract analysis. It addresses both primary concerns (like evidentiary integrity) and secondary considerations (like multi-jurisdictional complexities). The coverage spans different types of legal materials and various user scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15\nComment: There are several instances of direct duplication (e.g., Specs 13/10, 14/3, 15/5, 16/1 are identical pairs). While some overlap in critical areas like evidentiary handling is appropriate (Specs 1, 2, 7), the redundancy could be more efficiently managed through consolidation. The duplications, while potentially providing emphasis on critical areas, reduce the overall efficiency of the policy set.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific validation steps and concrete boundaries. They balance security needs with practical implementation considerations, such as using existing databases for verification and providing clear alternative paths (e.g., redirecting to qualified counsel). The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts while maintaining consistent standards.\n\nTOTAL=83\n\nThe policy group shows strong cohesion and comprehensive coverage but could benefit from reducing redundant specifications while maintaining emphasis on critical requirements. The practical implementation guidance is well-developed, making the policies readily applicable in real-world scenarios.",
