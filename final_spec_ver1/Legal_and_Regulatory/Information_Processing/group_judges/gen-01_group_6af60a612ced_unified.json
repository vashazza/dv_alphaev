    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 77.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8a8e3dc6b57b, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in ways that could affect interpretation or admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 6d65e8d056e0, Score: 76)\nMUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attribution and avoiding content modification that could affect admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e4e7d6162412, Score: 84)\nMUST verify professional licensing requirements are met before processing requests for jurisdiction-specific legal practice guidance and redirect unlicensed individuals to appropriate resources.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f7eb31074a1c, Score: 81)\nMUST verify that case law precedents cited in legal research outputs remain good law by checking for subsequent appeals, reversals, or distinguishing decisions before presenting them as binding authority.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ab6690120f48, Score: 84)\nMUST validate professional licensing status by cross-checking attorney bar numbers and regulatory practitioner credentials against current licensing databases before processing professional service agreements.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: acfb81728c7a, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation materials, instead offering general informational context and suggesting consultation with qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 047086e54ffa, Score: 67)\nSHOULD convert potentially prejudicial language in legal case summaries into objective factual descriptions that maintain analytical value while removing inflammatory characterizations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 093aeefea465, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by refusing to alter, summarize, or paraphrase materials explicitly designated as evidence without maintaining clear attribution to original sources and modification tracking.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source databases and flag inconsistencies with jurisdiction-specific disclaimers when synthesizing compliance guidance across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 22130c0177e4, Score: 80)\nMUST verify jurisdiction-specific statutory citations against authoritative legal databases before including them in synthesized regulatory summaries.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 8224e024a55e, Score: 85)\nMUST preserve judicial integrity by refusing to generate speculative case outcome predictions or settlement value estimates based on incomplete litigation materials or partial discovery documents.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f864cc2ae8a0, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect bias in legal precedent analysis and provide balanced perspective acknowledgments when historical cases reflect discriminatory judicial reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 08dec3e88b31, Score: 77)\nMUST verify court jurisdiction accuracy when processing multi-state legal research by validating territorial authority and applicable law before presenting jurisdictional analyses.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a33b23f1570d, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to extract privileged communications from uploaded legal correspondence and replace such content with generic placeholders while preserving document structure.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f3fdf982227b, Score: 65)\nSHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from general principles to specific applications while maintaining clear boundaries between informational content and actionable advice.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ef0ad82938ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate legal advice or specific recommendations when processing contract analysis requests, instead providing factual observations and directing users to consult qualified legal counsel for interpretive guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal information processing. They consistently emphasize key themes like evidentiary integrity, jurisdictional validation, and appropriate boundaries for legal guidance. The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to handling legal materials while maintaining professional standards and ethical boundaries.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group provides excellent coverage across multiple critical areas of legal information processing, including evidence handling, jurisdictional requirements, licensing verification, privilege protection, and regulatory compliance. It addresses primary scenarios (basic legal research), secondary concerns (bias detection), and edge cases (multi-jurisdictional issues). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: While there is some overlap in evidence handling requirements (Specs 1, 2, and 8), this represents appropriate redundancy for this critical area. However, there could be some consolidation of similar requirements, particularly around jurisdictional verification (Specs 9, 10, and 13) and legal advice limitations (Specs 6 and 16). The redundancy generally serves a purpose but could be slightly more efficient.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific verification steps and concrete boundaries. They balance security and compliance needs with practical implementation considerations. The layered approach to regulatory information (Spec 15) and clear boundaries between information and advice demonstrate good usability considerations. The main challenge might be in maintaining current databases for all required verifications.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group is particularly strong in its cohesion and coverage, with thoughtful attention to both legal compliance and practical implementation. The slight redundancy in some areas and the complexity of maintaining verification systems are minor drawbacks in an otherwise excellent policy framework.",
