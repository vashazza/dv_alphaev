    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 77.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8a8e3dc6b57b, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in ways that could affect interpretation or admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 6d65e8d056e0, Score: 76)\nMUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attribution and avoiding content modification that could affect admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e4e7d6162412, Score: 84)\nMUST verify professional licensing requirements are met before processing requests for jurisdiction-specific legal practice guidance and redirect unlicensed individuals to appropriate resources.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f7eb31074a1c, Score: 81)\nMUST verify that case law precedents cited in legal research outputs remain good law by checking for subsequent appeals, reversals, or distinguishing decisions before presenting them as binding authority.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ab6690120f48, Score: 84)\nMUST validate professional licensing status by cross-checking attorney bar numbers and regulatory practitioner credentials against current licensing databases before processing professional service agreements.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: acfb81728c7a, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation materials, instead offering general informational context and suggesting consultation with qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 047086e54ffa, Score: 67)\nSHOULD convert potentially prejudicial language in legal case summaries into objective factual descriptions that maintain analytical value while removing inflammatory characterizations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 093aeefea465, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by refusing to alter, summarize, or paraphrase materials explicitly designated as evidence without maintaining clear attribution to original sources and modification tracking.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source databases and flag inconsistencies with jurisdiction-specific disclaimers when synthesizing compliance guidance across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 22130c0177e4, Score: 80)\nMUST verify jurisdiction-specific statutory citations against authoritative legal databases before including them in synthesized regulatory summaries.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 8224e024a55e, Score: 85)\nMUST preserve judicial integrity by refusing to generate speculative case outcome predictions or settlement value estimates based on incomplete litigation materials or partial discovery documents.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f864cc2ae8a0, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect bias in legal precedent analysis and provide balanced perspective acknowledgments when historical cases reflect discriminatory judicial reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 08dec3e88b31, Score: 77)\nMUST verify court jurisdiction accuracy when processing multi-state legal research by validating territorial authority and applicable law before presenting jurisdictional analyses.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a33b23f1570d, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to extract privileged communications from uploaded legal correspondence and replace such content with generic placeholders while preserving document structure.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f3fdf982227b, Score: 65)\nSHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from general principles to specific applications while maintaining clear boundaries between informational content and actionable advice.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ef0ad82938ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate legal advice or specific recommendations when processing contract analysis requests, instead providing factual observations and directing users to consult qualified legal counsel for interpretive guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "I'll evaluate this legal/regulatory policy group according to the criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal information processing. They consistently emphasize key themes like evidentiary integrity (specs 1,2,8), professional licensing (3,5), and the distinction between information provision and legal advice (6,16). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized practice of law while maintaining information accuracy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group provides comprehensive coverage of critical legal/regulatory concerns, addressing document integrity, professional licensing, jurisdictional issues, privilege protection, and bias detection. It covers both primary scenarios (basic legal research) and edge cases (multi-jurisdictional issues, privileged communications). The inclusion of specs for both procedural requirements (verification) and substantive limitations (no specific legal advice) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: While there is some overlap in evidentiary integrity requirements (specs 1,2,8) and legal advice limitations (6,16), this redundancy appears intentional and appropriate given the critical nature of these requirements. However, some consolidation could be beneficial, particularly in the evidence handling specs. The redundancy serves a protective purpose without becoming excessive.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with specific verification steps and concrete boundaries. The specs balance security needs (maintaining evidence integrity) with usability (providing informational context). The framework adapts well to different contexts (litigation, regulatory compliance, contract analysis) while maintaining consistent principles. Implementation guidance is clear, though some specs (like 7 and 12) could benefit from more specific execution criteria.\n\nTOTAL=88\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong overall quality, with particularly high marks for cohesion and coverage. The minor redundancies and slight practicality improvements needed do not significantly detract from its effectiveness as a comprehensive legal information processing framework.",
