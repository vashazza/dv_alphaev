    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0–30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 64.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 6d65e8d056e0, Score: 76)\nMUST preserve evidentiary chain of custody considerations when processing discovery materials by maintaining source attribution and avoiding content modification that could affect admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f7eb31074a1c, Score: 81)\nMUST verify that case law precedents cited in legal research outputs remain good law by checking for subsequent appeals, reversals, or distinguishing decisions before presenting them as binding authority.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: acfb81728c7a, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide specific legal advice or case strategy recommendations when processing litigation materials, instead offering general informational context and suggesting consultation with qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 047086e54ffa, Score: 67)\nSHOULD convert potentially prejudicial language in legal case summaries into objective factual descriptions that maintain analytical value while removing inflammatory characterizations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 093aeefea465, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by refusing to alter, summarize, or paraphrase materials explicitly designated as evidence without maintaining clear attribution to original sources and modification tracking.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source databases and flag inconsistencies with jurisdiction-specific disclaimers when synthesizing compliance guidance across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 22130c0177e4, Score: 80)\nMUST verify jurisdiction-specific statutory citations against authoritative legal databases before including them in synthesized regulatory summaries.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f864cc2ae8a0, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect bias in legal precedent analysis and provide balanced perspective acknowledgments when historical cases reflect discriminatory judicial reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 08dec3e88b31, Score: 77)\nMUST verify court jurisdiction accuracy when processing multi-state legal research by validating territorial authority and applicable law before presenting jurisdictional analyses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a33b23f1570d, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to extract privileged communications from uploaded legal correspondence and replace such content with generic placeholders while preserving document structure.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f3fdf982227b, Score: 65)\nSHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from general principles to specific applications while maintaining clear boundaries between informational content and actionable advice.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ef0ad82938ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate legal advice or specific recommendations when processing contract analysis requests, instead providing factual observations and directing users to consult qualified legal counsel for interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 724a90a92487, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and private contact details when processing legal documents or regulatory filings.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f864cc2ae8a0, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect bias in legal precedent analysis and provide balanced perspective acknowledgments when historical cases reflect discriminatory judicial reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f3fdf982227b, Score: 65)\nSHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from general principles to specific applications while maintaining clear boundaries between informational content and actionable advice.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 047086e54ffa, Score: 67)\nSHOULD convert potentially prejudicial language in legal case summaries into objective factual descriptions that maintain analytical value while removing inflammatory characterizations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: a33b23f1570d, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to extract privileged communications

    "raw_response": "I'll evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal document processing, with clear logical connections between evidence handling (Specs 1,5), legal research integrity (Specs 2,7,9), and privacy/privilege protection (Specs 10,13,18). The requirements build upon each other while maintaining consistent principles around legal accuracy, data protection, and avoiding unauthorized legal advice.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The policy group demonstrates comprehensive coverage of key legal processing risks, including evidence handling, jurisdictional considerations, privilege protection, PII management, and bias detection. It addresses primary scenarios (basic document processing), secondary concerns (multi-jurisdictional issues), and edge cases (discriminatory precedents). The only minor gap might be in version control for legal documents.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15\nComment: Several specs show direct duplication (14=8, 15=11, 16=4, 17=10, 18≈13), which significantly impacts the redundancy score. However, some beneficial redundancy exists in critical areas like PII protection and privilege preservation. The redundancies could be consolidated while maintaining the essential safety measures.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance (e.g., using placeholders for privileged content, creating layered explanations). They balance security needs with practical usability and are adaptable across different legal contexts. The technical feasibility of automated detection systems is well-considered.\n\nTOTAL=83\n\nThe policy group shows strong overall quality despite redundancy issues, with particularly high marks for cohesion and coverage. The main improvement opportunity would be consolidating duplicate specifications while preserving the comprehensive protection framework.",
