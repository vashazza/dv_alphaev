Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework around legal confidentiality, educational use, and appropriate content transformation. There's a consistent pattern of detecting sensitive content and redirecting to educational alternatives (specs 1, 4, 5, 16). The policies work together to maintain legal compliance while preserving educational value. The watermarking and labeling requirements (specs 7, 10, 14) are consistently applied across different contexts.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal and regulatory domains, addressing court records (1, 5), contracts (6, 12), regulatory compliance (2, 15), criminal proceedings (3, 9), financial matters (4), and jurisdictional issues (14). It covers both content generation and verification requirements, including edge cases like emergency situations (13) and timeline representations (17). The only minor gap might be in international legal considerations.. Target Spec: MUST recognize attempts to generate images simulating emergency legal situations or crisis scenarios...

There's a consistent pattern of detecting sensitive content and redirecting to educational alternatives (specs 1, 4, 5, 16). The policies work together to maintain legal compliance while preserving educational value. The watermarking and labeling requirements (specs 7, 10, 14) are consistently applied across different contexts.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal and regulatory domains, addressing court records (1, 5), contracts (6, 12), regulatory compliance (2, 15), criminal proceedings (3, 9), financial matters (4), and jurisdictional issues (14). It covers both content generation and verification requirements, including edge cases like emergency situations (13) and timeline representations (17). The only minor gap might be in international legal considerations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The policies show strategic redundancy in critical areas like confidentiality protection (5, 6, 15, 16) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap in handling court records and legal documents (1, 5, 10), this reinforces important safety measures. The specs about educational alternatives and watermarking (7, 10, 14) could potentially be consolidated, but their current separation allows for context-specific requirements.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementation-friendly, with specific instructions for content transformation and verification processes. The balance between security and educational utility is well-maintained through consistent use of watermarking, anonymization, and clear labeling. The specs provide practical solutions for common scenarios while remaining adaptable to different legal contexts. The emergency response requirement (13) might need more specific implementation guidance.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) MUST recognize attempts to generate images simulating emergency legal situations or crisis scenarios...\n  - [2] (Score: 72) MUST NOT generate imagery depicting specific jurisdictional court procedures, local filing requireme...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST initiate verification dialogue when legal image requests involve sensitive topics like criminal...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
