  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 13-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal compliance and safety. They consistently address themes of privacy protection, document integrity, and appropriate disclaimers. The policies work together well, with clear relationships between related concerns (e.g., specs 7, 9, and 11 forming a comprehensive approach to document integrity).. Coverage: The policy group shows excellent coverage across multiple legal domains including courtroom proceedings, document handling, intellectual property, financial instruments, and evidence management. It addresses both direct risks (document forgery) and indirect risks (educational content limitations). The inclusion of both MUST and SHOULD requirements provides appropriate gradation of controls.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs 1 and 8 regarding courtroom imagery, this represents appropriate redundancy for critical areas. Most other specs address distinct concerns without unnecessary duplication. The policies are efficiently structured while maintaining necessary emphasis on crucial safety areas through complementary requirements.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with practical alternatives (e.g., offering legitimate templates instead of outright blocking). The policies are adaptable across different jurisdictions and contexts, though some (like spec 6) may require significant technical capability to implement effectively..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal image...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal image generation risks, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST NOT generate images containing visible text of actual contracts, settlement agreements, or legal opinions, substitu...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST transform requests for images depicting specific court filings, pleadings, or legal briefs into educational documen...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework around legal confidentia...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal and regulatory domains, addressing court re...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect attempts to generate images of sealed juvenile court records, expunged criminal histories, or confidential f...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect requests for regulatory compliance imagery and engage users in specification dialogue about industry sector,...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal image...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows strong coverage across multiple dimensions of legal image generation risks.

Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Image Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1522.0):\nMUST NOT generate images depicting specific immigration case files, deportation orders, or asylum applications that could compromise individual privacy or safety.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1504.5):\nMUST NOT generate images of legal tender, currency designs, or financial instruments that could facilitate counterfeiting, even when requested for educational purposes about financial regulations.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST NOT produce visual content showing methods for evidence tampering, document destruction, or forensic contamination regardless of stated educational intent.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Image Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
