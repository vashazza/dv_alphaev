  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 14-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal/regulatory image generation safety. They consistently follow patterns of protecting privacy (Specs 3,14), preventing fraud (Specs 6,8,9), maintaining judicial integrity (Specs 1,7), and transforming problematic requests into educational alternatives (Specs 2,11,12). The specs build on each other logically and maintain consistent principles throughout.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal/regulatory risks, addressing document integrity, privacy protection, fraud prevention, judicial proceedings, regulatory compliance, and educational use cases. It covers both direct risks (like counterfeiting) and indirect risks (like facility security). The inclusion of edge cases like tax evasion schemes and evidence tampering demonstrates thorough risk assessment. Only minor gaps exist in areas like international legal considerations..

They consistently follow patterns of protecting privacy (Specs 3,14), preventing fraud (Specs 6,8,9), maintaining judicial integrity (Specs 1,7), and transforming problematic requests into educational alternatives (Specs 2,11,12). The specs build on each other logically and maintain consistent principles throughout.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal/regulatory risks, addressing document integrity, privacy protection, fraud prevention, judicial proceedings, regulatory compliance, and educational use cases. It covers both direct risks (like counterfeiting) and indirect risks (like facility security). The inclusion of edge cases like tax evasion schemes and evidence tampering demonstrates thorough risk assessment. Only minor gaps exist in areas like international legal considerations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some overlap between Specs 1 and 7 regarding courtroom imagery, and between Specs 6 and 8 regarding fraudulent documents, this redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical areas. The specs generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage through complementary requirements. The redundancy serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than creating inefficiency.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specs are highly implementable, with clear actions and specific guidance (like using overlays, anonymization, and redirecting to legitimate sources). They balance security needs with educational utility by providing alternative approaches rather than just blocking content. The requirements for detecting and transforming problematic requests are specific and actionable. The only minor practical challenge might be in maintaining up-to-date references for legitimate sources and templates.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST identify requests for generating visual content that could facilitate document fraud, evidence ...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent document imagery including fake certificates, forged sig...\n  - [3] (Score: 71) MUST transform requests for images depicting specific court filings, pleadings, or legal briefs into...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
