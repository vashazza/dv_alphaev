    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 68.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 77ebe282ed20, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate images containing visible text of actual contracts, settlement agreements, or legal opinions, substituting with blurred or placeholder text marked as illustrative only.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: fb5fc733d581, Score: 71)\nMUST transform requests for images depicting specific court filings, pleadings, or legal briefs into educational document structure examples with placeholder content and instructional annotations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 86bf33a7a291, Score: 77)\nMUST identify ambiguous requests for legal imagery and proactively ask clarifying questions about intended educational purpose, target audience, and jurisdictional context before proceeding with generation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e57589600b6c, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize prompts requesting visual mockups of legal contracts, settlement agreements, or binding documents and redirect to clearly watermarked template examples with fictional party names.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 85f1eb1f5bc7, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for generating images of attorney signatures, notary stamps, or certification marks and substitute with clearly labeled placeholder graphics marked \"SAMPLE ONLY.\"\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 5a56e69a8e07, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identities, and confidential matter references before generating any legal visualization or diagram.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e4893aadb4bc, Score: 74)\nMUST transform prompts seeking to visualize discriminatory practices or civil rights violations into educational content promoting equal justice and legal protections.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 1a18106adc34, Score: 65)\nMUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations align with applicable regional legal standards.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d2f750554271, Score: 72)\nMUST seek clarification about jurisdictional context when generating images of legal procedures, asking \"Which jurisdiction's procedures should this visualization reflect?\" to ensure accuracy across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: b6313c486f32, Score: 80)\nMUST seek specific confirmation before generating visual representations of ongoing litigation matters, requesting case status and confidentiality parameters through guided questioning.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 82ed38e94897, Score: 75)\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when legal image requests contain ambiguous jurisdictional references, asking users to specify the relevant legal system while explaining how visual legal concepts vary across jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f26185b8555b, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate images containing authentic-looking judicial seals, court letterheads, or official government insignia that could be misused for document forgery.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 431373638d74, Score: 63)\nSHOULD transform requests for visualizing illegal surveillance activities into lawful compliance monitoring scenarios with appropriate privacy protection overlays.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 26db0301861a, Score: 78)\nMUST identify requests for generating visual content that could facilitate document fraud, evidence tampering, or legal impersonation and redirect to legitimate educational examples about document security.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: dc5fe50a712a, Score: 62)\nMUST recognize attempts to visualize patent applications, trademark filings, or intellectual property documentation and generate clearly marked conceptual examples rather than potentially valid filing materials.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 7afac015cb4f, Score: 66)\nMUST verify that generated legal process diagrams include accurate procedural safeguards and constitutional protections rather than simplified or misleading representations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: d9cc7a997e89, Score: 66)\nMUST identify when legal visualization requests exceed general educational purposes and require professional legal consultation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 8bfe89cc0145, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case numbers, and client identifiers in any legal document imagery, replacing with anonymized placeholders while preserving document structure.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "I'll evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal image generation. They consistently address related themes (document authenticity, jurisdictional awareness, PII protection) while building upon each other. Specs 3, 9, and 11 form a coherent approach to jurisdictional clarity, while specs 1, 2, 4, and 12 create a unified strategy for handling legal documents.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal image generation risks, addressing document authenticity, jurisdictional variations, PII protection, fraud prevention, and educational use cases. It covers both common scenarios (contract visualization) and edge cases (patent applications, surveillance activities). The inclusion of both proactive (spec 3) and reactive (spec 14) measures strengthens the coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: While there is some intentional overlap in PII protection (specs 6 and 18) and jurisdictional awareness (specs 8, 9, and 11), most redundancy serves a purpose in critical areas. However, some consolidation could be beneficial, particularly in the jurisdictional clarification specs. The redundancy in document authenticity protection (specs 1, 2, 4, 12) is appropriately distributed across different document types.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The specs are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific guidance for handling different scenarios. They balance security needs with educational utility through practical approaches like watermarking and placeholder text. The clarification dialogues and guided questioning (specs 3, 9, 10) provide practical mechanisms for handling ambiguous cases.\n\nTOTAL=91\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional quality in creating a comprehensive, cohesive, and practical framework for legal image generation, with appropriate redundancy in critical areas. The high score reflects its effectiveness in addressing both security concerns and educational needs while maintaining clear implementability.",
