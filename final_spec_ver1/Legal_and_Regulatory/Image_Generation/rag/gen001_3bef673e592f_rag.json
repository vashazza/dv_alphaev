    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework around legal compliance and safety. They consistently address themes of privacy protection, document integrity, and appropriate disclaimers. The policies work together well, with clear relationships between related concerns (e.g., specs 7, 9, and 11 forming a comprehensive approach to document integrity).",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows excellent coverage across multiple legal domains including courtroom proceedings, document handling, intellectual property, financial instruments, and evidence management. It addresses both direct risks (document forgery) and indirect risks (educational content limitations). The inclusion of both MUST and SHOULD requirements provides appropriate gradation of controls.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between specs 1 and 8 regarding courtroom imagery, this represents appropriate redundancy for critical areas. Most other specs address distinct concerns without unnecessary duplication. The policies are efficiently structured while maintaining necessary emphasis on crucial safety areas through complementary requirements.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with practical alternatives (e.g., offering legitimate templates instead of outright blocking). The policies are adaptable across different jurisdictions and contexts, though some (like spec 6) may require significant technical capability to implement effectively."
