    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal image generation. They consistently emphasize privacy protection, jurisdictional awareness, and educational purposes while maintaining clear relationships between different aspects (document handling, verification processes, and safety measures). The specs build upon each other logically, from basic document handling to specific use cases and edge scenarios.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains, addressing document generation, jurisdictional considerations, privacy concerns, and security risks. It covers primary scenarios (basic legal documents), secondary concerns (jurisdictional variations), and edge cases (potential misuse scenarios). The inclusion of both proactive measures (Specs 3, 10) and reactive restrictions (Specs 12, 17, 18) demonstrates comprehensive risk management.",
    "redundancy": "The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas (jurisdictional awareness, document security) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 8, 9, and 11 regarding jurisdictional concerns, but this serves to strengthen the policy rather than create inefficiency. The slight overlap between Specs 1, 2, and 4 regarding document handling provides necessary emphasis on critical safety areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable guidelines and specific parameters for image generation systems. The policies balance security needs with practical usability through features like clarifying dialogues and educational alternatives. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and provide concrete guidance for implementation. The inclusion of specific verification steps and alternative approaches makes the policies highly practical."
