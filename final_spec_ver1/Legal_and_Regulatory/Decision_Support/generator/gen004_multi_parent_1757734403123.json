  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 13-spec group. Average group score: 88.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation, privilege protection, and ethical compliance while maintaining clear relationships between different types of legal matters (employment, environmental, emergency situations, etc.). The specs build upon each other effectively, creating multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal advice.. Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal scenarios including litigation, contracts, employment law, environmental compliance, and emergency situations. It covers both procedural safeguards (PII protection, conflict detection) and substantive concerns (legal predictions, statute of limitations). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations and ethical rules demonstrates thorough coverage of the risk landscape.. Redundancy: While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is notable redundancy between SPEC 10 and SPEC 13 (identical PII protection requirements). Some overlap exists between SPEC 7 and other specs regarding unauthorized legal advice prevention, though this redundancy may be intentionally protective. The group could benefit from consolidating these overlapping elements while maintaining their protective function.. Practicality: The specs are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific triggers for different scenarios. They balance security needs with practical utility by allowing probabilistic assessments and analytical frameworks while restricting definitive legal advice. The requirements for guided questioning and detection mechanisms are specific and achievable with current technology..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing multiple critical areas of legal decision support i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal domains including family law, emplo...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child wel...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains including family law, intellectual ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for legal matters when confidence indicators fall below established t...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, employment, securities, tax, c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal d...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across various legal domains including employment law, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 88/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal d...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal scenarios including litigation, contracts, employme...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate decision support for employment law matters without detecting and addressing potential power imbalance...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support.
