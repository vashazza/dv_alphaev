Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize verification, authorization checks, and appropriate redirections to specialized counsel. The specs build on each other logically - from general principles (conflict checking, PII protection) to specific domain handling (tax, IP, employment law). The interconnected requirements for verification, confidence thresholds, and professional consultation create a robust safety net.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, contracts) and risk scenarios (conflicts of interest, time sensitivity, jurisdictional complexity). It addresses both primary concerns (authorization, competency) and edge cases (multi-state implications, information asymmetry).

They consistently emphasize verification, authorization checks, and appropriate redirections to specialized counsel. The specs build on each other logically - from general principles (conflict checking, PII protection) to specific domain handling (tax, IP, employment law). The interconnected requirements for verification, confidence thresholds, and professional consultation create a robust safety net.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, contracts) and risk scenarios (conflicts of interest, time sensitivity, jurisdictional complexity). It addresses both primary concerns (authorization, competency) and edge cases (multi-state implications, information asymmetry). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations beyond tax matters.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in PII protection (Specs 10 and 12) and verification requirements, most redundancy serves a clear purpose in reinforcing critical safety measures. The specs efficiently consolidate similar requirements across different legal domains while maintaining necessary domain-specific controls. The redundancy in verification and authorization checks is appropriate given the high-stakes nature of legal advice.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable, with specific verification steps and response modifications. The emphasis on interactive dialogue and guided questioning provides practical implementation paths. The balance between safety and usability is well-maintained through structured uncertainty disclosures and confidence intervals. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 68) SHOULD validate decision support recommendations against current ethical rules and bar standards for...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for legal matters when confidence indicators fall...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filin...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
