Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize verification, authorization, and appropriate redirections. The specs build on each other logically - from basic PII protection to specific domain handling (tax, securities, IP) while maintaining consistent principles around uncertainty disclosure and professional consultation requirements.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (employment, IP, tax, securities, contracts) and risk scenarios (conflicts of interest, time sensitivity, jurisdictional complexity). It addresses both procedural safeguards and substantive requirements, covering primary risks (unauthorized practice, PII exposure) and edge cases (multi-jurisdictional issues, information asymmetry)..

They consistently emphasize verification, authorization, and appropriate redirections. The specs build on each other logically - from basic PII protection to specific domain handling (tax, securities, IP) while maintaining consistent principles around uncertainty disclosure and professional consultation requirements.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (employment, IP, tax, securities, contracts) and risk scenarios (conflicts of interest, time sensitivity, jurisdictional complexity). It addresses both procedural safeguards and substantive requirements, covering primary risks (unauthorized practice, PII exposure) and edge cases (multi-jurisdictional issues, information asymmetry).\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in PII protection (specs 10, 12, and 20 are notably redundant), most repetition serves a valid purpose in reinforcing critical safety measures. The specs generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining appropriate redundancy for crucial areas like verification requirements and professional consultation triggers.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security with usability through structured dialogue approaches and graduated responses. The framework adapts well to different contexts through its emphasis on interactive verification and jurisdictional awareness. Implementation complexity is managed through clear decision paths.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file numbers, and cli...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file numbers, and att...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filin...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics. Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Decision Support\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case numbers, and client identifiers in all legal decision support responses while preserving analytical utility through anonymization techniques.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 89/100, Elo: 1501.9):\nMUST NOT provide decision support for settlement negotiations, mediation strategy, or alternative dispute resolution without confirming party representation status and redirecting unrepresented parties to independent counsel.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1516.0):\nMUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships without first confirming appropriate authorization and representation status through verification dialogue.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Decision Support safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
