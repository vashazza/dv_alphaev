  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize verification, authorization checks, and appropriate redirections to specialized counsel. The specs build on each other logically - from general principles (conflict checking, PII protection) to specific domain handling (tax, IP, employment law). The interconnected requirements for verification, confidence thresholds, and professional consultation create a robust safety net.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, contracts) and risk scenarios (conflicts of interest, time sensitivity, jurisdictional complexity). It addresses both primary concerns (authorization, competency) and edge cases (multi-state implications, information asymmetry). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations beyond tax matters.. Redundancy: Most redundancy is purposeful and strengthens critical areas (e.g., PII protection in specs 10 and 12). However, some consolidation could be beneficial - particularly in areas of professional consultation requirements and verification procedures. The redundancy in authorization checking across different legal domains provides appropriate safety overlap without excessive duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable, with specific verification steps and decision points. The emphasis on interactive dialogue and guided questioning makes implementation straightforward. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained through structured uncertainty disclosures and confidence intervals. The specs adapt well to different legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple legal domains including family law, empl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child wel...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing multiple critical areas of legal decision support i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains including family law, employment, e...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child wel...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal d...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows excellent coverage across multiple legal domains (employment, tax, securities...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support.
