  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 12-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (Specs 1, 2, 7, 8), maintain a clear focus on risk mitigation, and share common principles around verification and rewriting responses. The specs build on each other logically, from general principles (Spec 8) to specific applications (Specs 6, 9, 10).. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains including family law, employment, environmental, contracts, and emergency situations. It addresses various risk scenarios from privilege violations to unauthorized practice of law. The specs cover both procedural safeguards (Spec 3) and substantive requirements (Spec 12). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. While Specs 4 and 8 both address response modification, they serve distinct purposes. Specs 1, 7, and 12 complement each other in handling time-sensitive matters through different angles. The redundancy appears intentional and reinforcing rather than wasteful.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (e.g., \"detect,\" \"verify,\" \"rewrite\") and specific outcomes. The specs balance security with usability through structured questioning (Spec 11) and transformation of responses (Spec 12). They provide concrete guidance while maintaining flexibility for different jurisdictions and contexts. The verification dialogues and guided questioning make implementation straightforward..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing multiple critical areas of legal decision support i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple legal domains including family law, empl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child wel...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing multiple critical areas of legal decision support i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple legal domains including family law, empl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child wel...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support.
