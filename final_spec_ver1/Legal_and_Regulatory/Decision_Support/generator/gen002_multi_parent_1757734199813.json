  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 12-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (Specs 1,2,7,8), handle sensitive information appropriately (Specs 4,9), and maintain a unified approach to risk management. The specs build on each other logically, from general principles to specific scenarios, while maintaining consistent safety priorities.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal domains including family law, employment, environmental, contract law, and emergency situations. It addresses both routine and critical scenarios, covers procedural and substantive aspects, and includes provisions for different stakeholders. The inclusion of both general principles (Spec 8,11) and specific scenarios (Spec 6,7) ensures comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. While there is some overlap between Specs 8 and 11 regarding information gathering, this reinforces important safety measures. The policies efficiently combine related concerns (like Specs 9 and 10 for business-related matters) without excessive repetition.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (e.g., \"detect,\" \"verify,\" \"rewrite\") and specific response protocols. The policies balance security with usability through structured questioning (Spec 11) and probabilistic assessments (Spec 12). The framework adapts well to different contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple legal domains including family law, empl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child wel...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing multiple critical areas of legal decision support i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains including family law, employment, e...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewr...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child wel...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision suppo...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal d...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows excellent coverage across multiple legal domains (employment, tax, securities...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT provide decision support for legal matters involving minors, incapacitated persons, or fiduciary relationships ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST detect potential conflicts of interest when providing decision support involving multiple parties and flag such sce...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support.
