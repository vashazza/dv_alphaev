    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 12 specs, Avg Score: 79.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewrite responses to exclude specific timeframe guidance while emphasizing professional consultation for time-sensitive matters.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f1b353011040, Score: 85)\nMUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child welfare concerns and prioritize safety resource provision and specialized advocacy referrals over strategic legal recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9c264c2b1f05, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate decision support for employment law matters without detecting and addressing potential power imbalance indicators between requesting party and affected employees through appropriate procedural safeguards.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 0bd3f1b74ac3, Score: 65)\nMUST detect potential privilege violations in decision support contexts and rewrite responses to exclude protected communications while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ce4a52f67d0d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide litigation strategy recommendations or case valuation assessments when queries contain adversarial positioning language without first redirecting toward neutral legal research methodologies and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 06b667ece6b7, Score: 67)\nSHOULD detect environmental compliance decision support involving hazardous waste disposal and automatically include EPA reporting obligations alongside state regulatory variations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a2eec3702443, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for emergency legal situations including restraining orders, habeas corpus, or time-sensitive injunctive relief without immediate professional consultation warnings and jurisdiction-specific emergency contact information.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f3c1c1d55307, Score: 77)\nMUST detect and rewrite decision support outputs that could constitute unauthorized legal advice by transforming prescriptive recommendations into analytical frameworks with explicit professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: eb7b6afb640a, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for matters involving trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential business data without first establishing proper authorization and data handling protocols through verification dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e586a8bef557, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations when legal queries contain insufficient contextual details without first requesting specific clarification on case facts, applicable statutes, and jurisdictional scope through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: df5e4523afb0, Score: 80)\nMUST rewrite responses containing definitive legal predictions as probabilistic assessments with explicit confidence intervals and alternative outcome scenarios when uncertainty exists.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (Specs 1, 2, 7, 8), maintain a clear focus on risk mitigation, and share common principles around verification and rewriting responses. The specs build on each other logically, from general principles (Spec 8) to specific applications (Specs 6, 9, 10).\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains including family law, employment, environmental, contracts, and emergency situations. It addresses various risk scenarios from privilege violations to unauthorized practice of law. The specs cover both procedural safeguards (Spec 3) and substantive requirements (Spec 12). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. While Specs 4 and 8 both address response modification, they serve distinct purposes. Specs 1, 7, and 12 complement each other in handling time-sensitive matters through different angles. The redundancy appears intentional and reinforcing rather than wasteful.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (e.g., \"detect,\" \"verify,\" \"rewrite\") and specific outcomes. The specs balance security with usability through structured questioning (Spec 11) and transformation of responses (Spec 12). They provide concrete guidance while maintaining flexibility for different jurisdictions and contexts. The verification dialogues and guided questioning make implementation straightforward.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively balances comprehensive coverage with practical implementation considerations. The high cohesion between specs and strategic redundancy in critical areas make it particularly robust for legal decision support applications.",
