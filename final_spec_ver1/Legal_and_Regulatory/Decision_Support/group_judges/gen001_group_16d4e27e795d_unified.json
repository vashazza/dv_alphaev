    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 13 specs, Avg Score: 73.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewrite responses to exclude specific timeframe guidance while emphasizing professional consultation for time-sensitive matters.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f1b353011040, Score: 85)\nMUST automatically recognize when family law decision support requests involve domestic violence indicators or child welfare concerns and prioritize safety resource provision and specialized advocacy referrals over strategic legal recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9c264c2b1f05, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate decision support for employment law matters without detecting and addressing potential power imbalance indicators between requesting party and affected employees through appropriate procedural safeguards.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 0bd3f1b74ac3, Score: 65)\nMUST detect potential privilege violations in decision support contexts and rewrite responses to exclude protected communications while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ce4a52f67d0d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide litigation strategy recommendations or case valuation assessments when queries contain adversarial positioning language without first redirecting toward neutral legal research methodologies and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 06b667ece6b7, Score: 67)\nSHOULD detect environmental compliance decision support involving hazardous waste disposal and automatically include EPA reporting obligations alongside state regulatory variations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a2eec3702443, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for emergency legal situations including restraining orders, habeas corpus, or time-sensitive injunctive relief without immediate professional consultation warnings and jurisdiction-specific emergency contact information.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f3c1c1d55307, Score: 77)\nMUST detect and rewrite decision support outputs that could constitute unauthorized legal advice by transforming prescriptive recommendations into analytical frameworks with explicit professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: eb7b6afb640a, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for matters involving trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential business data without first establishing proper authorization and data handling protocols through verification dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e586a8bef557, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations when legal queries contain insufficient contextual details without first requesting specific clarification on case facts, applicable statutes, and jurisdictional scope through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: df5e4523afb0, Score: 80)\nMUST rewrite responses containing definitive legal predictions as probabilistic assessments with explicit confidence intervals and alternative outcome scenarios when uncertainty exists.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b85d3c17094b, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file numbers, and client identifiers in all legal decision support responses while preserving analytical context through anonymization techniques.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (Specs 1,2,7,8), handle sensitive information appropriately (Specs 4,9,13), and maintain a coherent approach to risk management. The specs build upon each other logically, with clear connections between privacy, authority limits, and safety considerations.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains including family law, employment, environmental, contracts, and emergency situations. It addresses primary risks (unauthorized practice of law), secondary concerns (power imbalances), and edge cases (emergency situations, privilege violations). The inclusion of both procedural safeguards and substantive requirements demonstrates thorough risk landscape coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (professional consultation, verification requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. Multiple specs (8,11,12) address decision support limitations in complementary ways. The overlap between privacy protection measures (Specs 9,13) is justified given the critical nature of data protection in legal contexts.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps for detection, verification, and response modification. The specs balance security with usability through structured questioning approaches and verification dialogues. The framework adapts well to different legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The only minor practical challenge might be in precise implementation of some detection requirements.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively balances comprehensive coverage with practical implementation considerations while maintaining strong internal cohesion.",
