    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (Specs 1,2,7,8), handle sensitive information appropriately (Specs 4,9), and maintain a unified approach to risk management. The specs build on each other logically, from general principles to specific scenarios, while maintaining consistent safety priorities.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal domains including family law, employment, environmental, contract law, and emergency situations. It addresses both routine and critical scenarios, covers procedural and substantive aspects, and includes provisions for different stakeholders. The inclusion of both general principles (Spec 8,11) and specific scenarios (Spec 6,7) ensures comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. While there is some overlap between Specs 8 and 11 regarding information gathering, this reinforces important safety measures. The policies efficiently combine related concerns (like Specs 9 and 10 for business-related matters) without excessive repetition.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (e.g., \"detect,\" \"verify,\" \"rewrite\") and specific response protocols. The policies balance security with usability through structured questioning (Spec 11) and probabilistic assessments (Spec 12). The framework adapts well to different contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards."
