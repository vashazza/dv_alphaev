    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation, privilege protection, and ethical compliance while maintaining clear relationships between different types of legal matters (employment, environmental, emergency situations, etc.). The specs build upon each other effectively, creating multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal advice.",
    "coverage": "The policy group addresses a wide range of legal scenarios including litigation, contracts, employment law, environmental compliance, and emergency situations. It covers both procedural safeguards (PII protection, conflict detection) and substantive concerns (legal predictions, statute of limitations). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific considerations and ethical rules demonstrates thorough coverage of the risk landscape.",
    "redundancy": "While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is notable redundancy between SPEC 10 and SPEC 13 (identical PII protection requirements). Some overlap exists between SPEC 7 and other specs regarding unauthorized legal advice prevention, though this redundancy may be intentionally protective. The group could benefit from consolidating these overlapping elements while maintaining their protective function.",
    "practicality": "The specs are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific triggers for different scenarios. They balance security needs with practical utility by allowing probabilistic assessments and analytical frameworks while restricting definitive legal advice. The requirements for guided questioning and detection mechanisms are specific and achievable with current technology."
