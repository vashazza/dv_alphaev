    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize verification, authorization checks, and appropriate redirections to specialized counsel. The specs build on each other logically - from general principles (conflict checking, PII protection) to specific domain handling (tax, IP, employment law). The interconnected requirements for verification, confidence thresholds, and professional consultation create a robust safety net.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains (IP, tax, employment, securities, contracts) and risk scenarios (conflicts of interest, time sensitivity, jurisdictional complexity). It addresses both primary concerns (authorization, competency) and edge cases (multi-state implications, information asymmetry). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations beyond tax matters.",
    "redundancy": "Most redundancy is purposeful and strengthens critical areas (e.g., PII protection in specs 10 and 12). However, some consolidation could be beneficial - particularly in areas of professional consultation requirements and verification procedures. The redundancy in authorization checking across different legal domains provides appropriate safety overlap without excessive duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable, with specific verification steps and decision points. The emphasis on interactive dialogue and guided questioning makes implementation straightforward. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained through structured uncertainty disclosures and confidence intervals. The specs adapt well to different legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards."
