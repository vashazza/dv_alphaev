    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (specs 1,2,7,8), handle sensitive information appropriately (specs 4,9), and maintain a clear approach to uncertainty and risk management (specs 11,12). The specs build on each other logically, creating a robust safety net for various legal scenarios while maintaining consistent principles throughout.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple legal domains including family law, employment law, environmental compliance, contract law, and emergency situations. It addresses both routine and critical scenarios, covering procedural aspects (spec 8), substantive legal issues (specs 3,6), and special circumstances (specs 2,7). The inclusion of data handling, privilege concerns, and jurisdictional considerations demonstrates thorough risk landscape coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. While specs 8 and 11 have some overlap in handling insufficient information, they serve distinct purposes. The reinforcement of key safety principles across different contexts (specs 1,5,7,12) provides necessary redundancy without inefficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (specs 1,2,6), specific response modifications (specs 4,8,12), and concrete verification steps (specs 9,10,11). The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, with practical approaches to handling sensitive situations while still providing valuable guidance. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions."
