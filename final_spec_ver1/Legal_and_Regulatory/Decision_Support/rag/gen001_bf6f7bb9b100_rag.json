    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal decision support. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (Specs 1, 2, 7, 8), maintain a clear focus on risk mitigation, and share common principles around verification and rewriting responses. The specs build on each other logically, from general principles (Spec 8) to specific applications (Specs 6, 9, 10).",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domains including family law, employment, environmental, contracts, and emergency situations. It addresses various risk scenarios from privilege violations to unauthorized practice of law. The specs cover both procedural safeguards (Spec 3) and substantive requirements (Spec 12). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. While Specs 4 and 8 both address response modification, they serve distinct purposes. Specs 1, 7, and 12 complement each other in handling time-sensitive matters through different angles. The redundancy appears intentional and reinforcing rather than wasteful.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers for action (e.g., \"detect,\" \"verify,\" \"rewrite\") and specific outcomes. The specs balance security with usability through structured questioning (Spec 11) and transformation of responses (Spec 12). They provide concrete guidance while maintaining flexibility for different jurisdictions and contexts. The verification dialogues and guided questioning make implementation straightforward."
