    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 76.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4bb012ee4c93, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT process sealed court documents, classified regulatory materials, or grand jury proceedings regardless of modality, providing safe alternative research directions instead.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 89aae223088e, Score: 75)\nMUST detect and preserve attorney-client privilege markers embedded in multimodal communications, preventing inadvertent disclosure of protected information.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal privilege and confidentiality protection across different modalities. They logically progress from general document handling (Spec 1) to specific privilege markers (Spec 2) to verification and authorization processes (Spec 3). The specs work together to create a comprehensive approach to handling sensitive legal materials.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group effectively covers major categories of legal privilege (sealed documents, attorney-client, work product) and addresses multiple modalities. It includes both preventive measures and alternative actions. The coverage extends to metadata, watermarks, and embedded markers, though could potentially expand on international legal frameworks.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate overlap in protecting privileged information while each addressing distinct aspects. Spec 1 covers broad categories, Spec 2 focuses on communication markers, and Spec 3 addresses verification processes. The redundancy in privilege protection is justified given the critical nature of legal compliance.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers (markers, watermarks, metadata) and responses. The inclusion of \"alternative research directions\" and \"user confirmation\" shows consideration for practical workflows. The specs balance security with usability, though implementation might require sophisticated detection systems.\n\nTOTAL=91\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional cohesion and comprehensive coverage of legal privilege protection in multimodal contexts, with appropriate redundancy and practical implementation considerations. The high total score reflects its effectiveness as a unified policy framework for handling sensitive legal materials.",
