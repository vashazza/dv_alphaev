    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 76.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4bb012ee4c93, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT process sealed court documents, classified regulatory materials, or grand jury proceedings regardless of modality, providing safe alternative research directions instead.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 89aae223088e, Score: 75)\nMUST detect and preserve attorney-client privilege markers embedded in multimodal communications, preventing inadvertent disclosure of protected information.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 2ce573cfa3bf, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal privilege and confidentiality protection across different modalities. They naturally build upon each other - from broad document handling (Spec 1), to communication privilege (Spec 2), to specific work product protections (Spec 3). The progression from general to specific creates a logical policy hierarchy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group comprehensively covers major legal privilege categories: sealed documents, attorney-client communications, and work product. It addresses both content and metadata aspects, and spans multiple modalities. The only minor gap might be in handling of international legal frameworks and jurisdictional variations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate reinforcement in critical areas. Each spec focuses on a distinct privilege type, though they share common themes of protection and verification. The redundancy in verification mechanisms (watermarks, stamps, metadata) is justified given the critical nature of legal privilege.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., \"safe alternative research directions\", \"cross-modal verification\"). The specs balance security with usability by including user confirmation mechanisms. The multimodal focus makes them adaptable to various content types and communication channels.\n\nTOTAL=91\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional cohesion and comprehensive coverage of legal privilege protections while maintaining practical implementability. The high score reflects its effectiveness as a unified framework for handling sensitive legal content across modalities.",
