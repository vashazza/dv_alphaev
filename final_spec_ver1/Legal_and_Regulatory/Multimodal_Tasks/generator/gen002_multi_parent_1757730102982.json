Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regulatory multimodal content. They logically build upon each other, addressing related concerns like document authenticity (SPEC 5, 13), temporal consistency (SPEC 1, 6), and privileged communications (SPEC 7). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining logical connections between different requirements.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal and regulatory scenarios. It addresses document authenticity, privacy concerns, jurisdictional issues, privileged communications, and professional liability. The specs cover both primary use cases and edge cases, including grand jury materials (SPEC 10), biometric data (SPEC 2), and evidentiary chain of custody (SPEC 4). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas like document verification and authenticity checking (SPECS 5, 13, 16, 17) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap in temporal verification (SPECS 1, 6) and content verification requirements, this redundancy appears intentional and serves to strengthen the security framework rather than create inefficiency.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific conditions and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical implementation considerations, such as providing alternative solutions when processing must be declined (SPEC 10). The specs are adaptable to different legal contexts and include practical elements like disclaimers and warning systems..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal/regulatory scenarios, addressing do...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): SHOULD detect temporal misalignment between visual regulatory documents and current legal standards, warning users about...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST pause content generation when biometric data, voice prints, or facial recognition markers in multimodal inputs coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across various legal/regulatory scenarios.
