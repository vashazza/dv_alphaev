  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regulatory multimodal content. They consistently address related themes like document authenticity (specs 5, 13), temporal alignment (specs 1, 6), and privileged information protection (specs 7, 10). The specs build upon each other logically, creating a robust chain of verification and protection mechanisms.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal/regulatory scenarios, addressing document authenticity, jurisdictional concerns, privacy protection, and professional liability. It covers both common situations (contract reviews, case analysis) and edge cases (grand jury materials, forged documents). The inclusion of specific requirements for different content types (audio, visual, textual) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like document verification and authenticity checking) while avoiding excessive overlap. While specs 5 and 13 both address document authenticity, they focus on different aspects (initial verification vs. forgery detection). Some minor consolidation could be possible between temporal alignment specs (1 and 6), but the current structure maintains clarity.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific conditions and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical implementation considerations, providing alternative actions when restrictions apply. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions, though some might require sophisticated technical capabilities for full implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal multi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks.
