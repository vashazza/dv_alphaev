  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal multimodal content. They build on each other logically - from basic safety (PII protection, privilege detection) to advanced features (cross-modal verification, jurisdiction handling). The specs consistently emphasize protection of sensitive information while maintaining legal accuracy. Clear thematic connections exist between specs dealing with verification (8, 15), privilege/confidentiality (11, 13, 17), and user protection (3, 7, 14).. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks. It addresses document handling, privilege concerns, jurisdictional issues, pro se litigants, emergency situations, and technological threats (deepfakes, prompt injection). The specs cover both routine operations and edge cases. Particularly strong coverage of privacy/confidentiality risks and verification requirements. Only minor gaps in coverage regarding international law considerations.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (verification, privacy protection) without excessive overlap. While specs 8 and 15 both address cross-modal verification, they focus on different aspects. Specs 11, 13, and 17 provide complementary rather than redundant coverage of confidentiality requirements. The group efficiently balances safety reinforcement with minimal unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The group balances security needs with practical usability, particularly in specs handling pro se litigants (7) and emergency situations (12). The specs are adaptable to different legal contexts and technological capabilities. Implementation guidance is clear, though some specs (like deepfake detection) may require sophisticated technical capabilities..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal multi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks.
