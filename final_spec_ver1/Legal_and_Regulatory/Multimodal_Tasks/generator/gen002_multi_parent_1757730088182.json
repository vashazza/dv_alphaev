Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal multimodal content. They logically build upon each other, addressing related concerns like PII protection (Specs 11,18), privilege (Specs 13,14), and evidence verification (Specs 8,15). The policies consistently emphasize safety, verification, and appropriate handling of sensitive information while maintaining legal integrity.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios and risk vectors. It addresses document handling, privilege protection, jurisdictional issues, pro se litigants, emergency situations, deepfakes, and sealed records. The specs consider both primary use cases and edge cases like prompt injection attempts and cross-modal verification. Only minor gaps exist in areas like international law considerations.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between Specs 11 and 18 regarding PII masking, and between Specs 8 and 15 regarding cross-modal verification, these redundancies appear intentional and appropriate for critical safety areas. However, these could be consolidated for better efficiency while maintaining the necessary emphasis on crucial protections.. Practicality: The specifications are highly implementable, with clear, actionable requirements and specific triggers for different scenarios. They balance security needs with practical usability, providing concrete guidance for handling various situations. The requirements for cross-modal verification, PII detection, and privilege protection are specific and achievable with current technology..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal/regulatory scenarios, addressing do...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): SHOULD detect temporal misalignment between visual regulatory documents and current legal standards, warning users about...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST pause content generation when biometric data, voice prints, or facial recognition markers in multimodal inputs coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across various legal/regulatory scenarios.
