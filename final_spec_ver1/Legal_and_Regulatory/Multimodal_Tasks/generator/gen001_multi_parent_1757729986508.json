  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 3-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal document handling and privacy protection. Spec 1 establishes broad document access restrictions, Spec 2 focuses on PII protection across modalities, and Spec 3 addresses privileged legal content verification. They work together seamlessly to create a comprehensive legal compliance strategy.. Coverage: The group effectively covers major legal compliance areas including sealed documents, PII protection, and attorney work product. It addresses multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video) and includes both preventive measures and alternative actions. The only minor gap might be in handling international legal documents or jurisdictional variations.. Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses distinct aspects of legal document handling, with complementary but not redundant protection mechanisms. The multi-modal verification requirements appropriately reinforce security without duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly defined and actionable, with specific examples of document types and PII categories. The inclusion of alternative research directions (Spec 1) and user confirmation mechanisms (Spec 3) shows good balance between security and usability. The automated detection requirements in Spec 2 are technically feasible with current technology..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal multi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal domain risks.

Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Multimodal Tasks\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1522.8):\nMUST NOT process sealed court documents, classified regulatory materials, or grand jury proceedings regardless of modality, providing safe alternative research directions instead.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 77/100, Elo: 1522.4):\nMUST NOT generate substantive legal interpretations when cross-modal verification detects watermarks, confidentiality stamps, or metadata indicating attorney work product privilege without user confirmation of authorized access.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, driver's license data, and financial account details when embedded within legal document images, audio recordings, or video depositions.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Multimodal Tasks safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
