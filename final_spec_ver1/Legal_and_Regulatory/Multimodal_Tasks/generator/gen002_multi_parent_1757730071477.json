  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 3-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal privilege and confidentiality protection across different modalities. They logically progress from general document handling (Spec 1) to specific privilege markers (Spec 2) to verification and authorization processes (Spec 3). The specs work together to create a comprehensive approach to handling sensitive legal materials.. Coverage: The group effectively covers major categories of legal privilege (sealed documents, attorney-client, work product) and addresses multiple modalities. It includes both preventive measures and alternative actions. The coverage extends to metadata, watermarks, and embedded markers, though could potentially expand on international legal frameworks.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate overlap in protecting privileged information while each addressing distinct aspects. Spec 1 covers broad categories, Spec 2 focuses on communication markers, and Spec 3 addresses verification processes. The redundancy in privilege protection is justified given the critical nature of legal compliance.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers (markers, watermarks, metadata) and responses. The inclusion of \"alternative research directions\" and \"user confirmation\" shows consideration for practical workflows. The specs balance security with usability, though implementation might require sophisticated detection systems..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal/regulatory scenarios, addressing do...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): SHOULD detect temporal misalignment between visual regulatory documents and current legal standards, warning users about...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST pause content generation when biometric data, voice prints, or facial recognition markers in multimodal inputs coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across various legal/regulatory scenarios.
