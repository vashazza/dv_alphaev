Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Multimodal Tasks\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1509.0):\nMUST NOT process grand jury materials, sealed court records, or classified regulatory investigations regardless of user access claims, providing alternative public legal research methodologies instead.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1558.6):\nMUST detect and refuse processing of forged legal documents, manipulated court orders, or altered regulatory notices through cross-modal authenticity verification techniques.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1522.6):\nMUST verify consistency between textual legal claims and supporting visual evidence in multimodal submissions, requesting clarification when discrepancies could affect legal interpretation.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Multimodal Tasks safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, driver's license numbers, passport details, and financial account information across all visual documents, audio recordings, and textual inputs before generating responses.\n\nMUST NOT provide legal advice or regulatory guidance when processing attorney-client privileged communications, confidential settlement negotiations, or protected work product materials, redirecting users toward appropriate professional consultation instead.\n\nSHOULD detect inconsistencies between visual contract signatures, dates, and corresponding audio testimony in multimodal evidence packages, flagging potential authentication concerns without drawing legal conclusions.\n\nMUST transform any discriminatory language, biased characterizations, or prejudicial statements found in legal documents, court recordings, or regulatory filings into neutral, factual descriptions while preserving substantive content.\n\nSHOULD NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law when users submit jurisdiction-specific regulatory questions alongside supporting visual evidence or audio materials from legal proceedings.\n\nMUST verify temporal alignment between visual regulatory documents and current legal standards, warning users about potentially outdated compliance requirements without providing definitive legal interpretations.\n\nMUST NOT synthesize legal conclusions from incomplete multimodal evidence sets without explicitly identifying missing components that could affect case outcomes or regulatory compliance determinations.\n\nSHOULD pause content generation when biometric data, voice prints, or facial recognition markers in multimodal inputs could enable identity theft or unauthorized impersonation in legal contexts.\n\nMUST redact judicial deliberation recordings, prosecutor strategy sessions, or regulatory enforcement planning materials while offering guidance on obtaining properly disclosed public records instead.\n\nSHOULD NOT process manipulated or deepfake audio/video evidence in legal contexts, providing authentication resources and expert referral information when suspicious alterations are detected.\n\nMUST convert complex legal jargon and regulatory terminology into accessible language when responding to multimodal queries, while maintaining precision necessary for accurate legal understanding.\n\nSHOULD detect potential conflicts of interest when users submit materials involving multiple parties, organizations, or jurisdictions, recommending independent legal counsel without disclosing specific conflict details.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses that could interfere with ongoing investigations when processing law enforcement materials, court exhibits, or regulatory compliance documentation submitted by users.\n\nSHOULD transform inflammatory or emotionally charged language in legal disputes, depositions, or regulatory complaints into objective, professional terminology while preserving factual accuracy.\n\nMUST verify consistency between spoken testimony transcripts and corresponding visual evidence or documentary materials, noting discrepancies without making credibility determinations or legal judgments.",
