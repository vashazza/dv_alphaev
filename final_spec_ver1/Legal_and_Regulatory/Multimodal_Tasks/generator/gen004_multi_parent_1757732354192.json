  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 89.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for handling legal multimodal content. They build upon each other effectively - from basic PII protection (Specs 11,18,19) to sophisticated cross-modal verification (Specs 8,15) and privilege handling (Specs 13,14). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent objectives around privacy, accuracy, and legal compliance.. Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across various legal scenarios and risk vectors. It addresses primary concerns (document handling, PII protection), secondary issues (jurisdictional requirements, conflict checking), and edge cases (emergency situations, deepfakes). The specs cover both technical and procedural aspects, from data protection to proper handling of sensitive cases like juvenile records and privileged communications.. Redundancy: While there is some beneficial redundancy in critical areas like PII protection (Specs 11,18,19 have significant overlap), most specs serve distinct purposes. The redundancy around PII handling could be consolidated. However, the overlapping coverage in sensitive areas (like privilege detection and cross-modal verification) provides appropriate backup without excessive duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The policies balance security needs with practical implementation considerations, such as adjusting complexity for pro se litigants (Spec 7) and handling emergency situations (Spec 12). The framework appears adaptable to different legal contexts while maintaining consistent security standards..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal/regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal and regulatory scenarios.
