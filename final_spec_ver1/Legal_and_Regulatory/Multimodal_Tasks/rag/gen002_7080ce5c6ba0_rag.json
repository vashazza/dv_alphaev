    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework. They build upon each other effectively - from authentication (Spec 5) to processing (Specs 4, 6) to output generation (Specs 3, 7, 13). The policies work together to create a comprehensive approach to legal content handling, with clear relationships between document validation, processing requirements, and output constraints.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides excellent coverage across multiple dimensions of legal/regulatory compliance, including temporal aspects (Specs 1, 6), jurisdictional considerations (Specs 10, 15), privacy/security (Specs 2, 7), and professional liability (Specs 8, 16). It addresses both technical and procedural requirements, covering authentication, processing, and output generation. The inclusion of emotional/psychological considerations (Spec 14) shows attention to edge cases.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like verification and validation) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between temporal checking specs (1 and 6) and jurisdictional requirements (10 and 15), but this appears strategic rather than wasteful. The policies maintain robustness through complementary requirements rather than direct duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific conditions and responses defined. They balance security needs with operational feasibility, though some specs (like continuous cross-modal validation) might be computationally intensive. The framework allows for adaptation to different contexts while maintaining core compliance requirements. The inclusion of practical elements like disclaimers and content warnings enhances implementability."
