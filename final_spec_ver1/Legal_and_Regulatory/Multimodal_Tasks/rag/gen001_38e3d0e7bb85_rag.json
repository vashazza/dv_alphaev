    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal document handling and privacy protection. Spec 1 establishes broad document access restrictions, Spec 2 focuses on PII protection across modalities, and Spec 3 addresses privileged legal content verification. They work together seamlessly to create a comprehensive legal compliance strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers major legal compliance areas including sealed documents, PII protection, and attorney work product. It addresses multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video) and includes both preventive measures and alternative actions. The only minor gap might be in handling international legal documents or jurisdictional variations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses distinct aspects of legal document handling, with complementary but not redundant protection mechanisms. The multi-modal verification requirements appropriately reinforce security without duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly defined and actionable, with specific examples of document types and PII categories. The inclusion of alternative research directions (Spec 1) and user confirmation mechanisms (Spec 3) shows good balance between security and usability. The automated detection requirements in Spec 2 are technically feasible with current technology."
