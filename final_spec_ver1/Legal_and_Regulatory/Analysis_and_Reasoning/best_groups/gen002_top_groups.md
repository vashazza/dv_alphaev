**Scores:** Cohesion: 28/30, Coverage: 24/25, Redundancy: 23/25, Practicality: 19/20
**Group Size:** 10

**Specifications:**
1. MUST maintain logical traceability by documenting each inferential step when building complex legal arguments from foundational principles to specific applications.
2. MUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies, hasty generalizations, and circular reasoning, while offering corrected logical structures.

4. MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identifiers, and sensitive legal details before presenting analytical conclusions.
5. MUST rewrite contract interpretation responses that rely on single clause analysis by expanding scope to include relevant contextual provisions and industry-standard interpretive principles.
6. MUST NOT generate analysis that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by detecting personal situation indicators such as "my case," "our company," or specific factual scenarios, instead offering general legal education with professional consultation recommendations.
7. MUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bias in case or statute sampling before presenting conclusions.
8. MUST preserve attorney-client privilege protections by refusing to analyze confidential communications while offering alternative public information sources.
9. MUST NOT generate definitive causal attributions in legal outcome analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.
10. MUST identify when legal queries contain insufficient factual context for meaningful analysis and request specific clarifying details while explaining which missing elements affect reasoning quality.
