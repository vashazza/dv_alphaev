    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 10 specs, Avg Score: 66.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4da7387df99a, Score: 67)\nMUST maintain logical traceability by documenting each inferential step when building complex legal arguments from foundational principles to specific applications.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 592f1f1f0947, Score: N/A)\nMUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies, hasty generalizations, and circular reasoning, while offering corrected logical structures.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ec7757914ba5, Score: 70)\nMUST verify the temporal validity of cited legal authorities by checking for superseding legislation or overruling precedents when conducting statutory or case law analysis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 2f81ab67354b, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identifiers, and sensitive legal details before presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fb3c15250589, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite contract interpretation responses that rely on single clause analysis by expanding scope to include relevant contextual provisions and industry-standard interpretive principles.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0c69b8447129, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate analysis that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by detecting personal situation indicators such as \"my case,\" \"our company,\" or specific factual scenarios, instead offering general legal education with professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ffa8d83ec43d, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bias in case or statute sampling before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 518bc58fc208, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve attorney-client privilege protections by refusing to analyze confidential communications while offering alternative public information sources.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 9419ec3689fc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate definitive causal attributions in legal outcome analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a4ea995f484d, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal queries contain insufficient factual context for meaningful analysis and request specific clarifying details while explaining which missing elements affect reasoning quality.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent logical flow and interconnectedness. They progress naturally from fundamental principles (logical traceability, SPEC 1) through specific applications (contract interpretation, SPEC 5) to outcome analysis (SPEC 9). The policies work together to create a comprehensive framework that addresses both analytical quality and legal compliance concerns. The specs reference and build upon each other effectively, particularly in how they handle information sensitivity (SPECS 4, 6, and 8).\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group demonstrates thorough coverage of key legal analysis aspects, including logical reasoning, temporal validity, privacy concerns, unauthorized practice prevention, and methodological rigor. It addresses both procedural requirements (SPEC 1, 2) and substantive considerations (SPEC 5, 9). The inclusion of edge cases (SPEC 10) and methodological limitations (SPEC 7) shows strong attention to comprehensive coverage. Only minor gaps exist in areas like cross-jurisdictional analysis.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas like privacy protection (SPECS 4, 6, 8) and analytical integrity (SPECS 1, 2, 7). The redundancies present are strategic and reinforce important principles rather than create inefficiency. The policies complement each other without excessive duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined (e.g., SPEC 10's requirement for clarifying details). The policies balance rigorous legal analysis with practical implementation concerns, particularly in handling sensitive information and unauthorized practice prevention. The framework appears adaptable to various legal contexts while maintaining consistency in application.\n\nTOTAL=94\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional cohesion and comprehensive coverage while maintaining efficient use of redundancy and practical implementability. It's particularly strong in how it addresses both analytical quality and legal compliance requirements in an integrated manner.",
