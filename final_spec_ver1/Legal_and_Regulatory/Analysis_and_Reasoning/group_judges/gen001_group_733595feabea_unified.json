    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 11 specs, Avg Score: 66.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4da7387df99a, Score: 67)\nMUST maintain logical traceability by documenting each inferential step when building complex legal arguments from foundational principles to specific applications.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9e70cef6261c, Score: 65)\nMUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies and hasty generalizations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ec7757914ba5, Score: 70)\nMUST verify the temporal validity of cited legal authorities by checking for superseding legislation or overruling precedents when conducting statutory or case law analysis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 2f81ab67354b, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identifiers, and sensitive legal details before presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fb3c15250589, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite contract interpretation responses that rely on single clause analysis by expanding scope to include relevant contextual provisions and industry-standard interpretive principles.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0c69b8447129, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate analysis that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by detecting personal situation indicators such as \"my case,\" \"our company,\" or specific factual scenarios, instead offering general legal education with professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ffa8d83ec43d, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bias in case or statute sampling before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 518bc58fc208, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve attorney-client privilege protections by refusing to analyze confidential communications while offering alternative public information sources.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 9419ec3689fc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate definitive causal attributions in legal outcome analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a4ea995f484d, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal queries contain insufficient factual context for meaningful analysis and request specific clarifying details while explaining which missing elements affect reasoning quality.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d494ffd19faa, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identifiers, and sensitive legal details before presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework for legal analysis and compliance. They logically build upon each other, from fundamental principles (SPEC 1) through specific applications (SPEC 5), while maintaining consistent themes of privacy protection, logical rigor, and unauthorized practice prevention. The policies work together to create a comprehensive system of checks and balances.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key legal analysis domains including privacy (SPEC 4,8), logical reasoning (SPEC 1,2), temporal validity (SPEC 3), contextual analysis (SPEC 5,7), and unauthorized practice prevention (SPEC 6). It addresses both procedural and substantive aspects of legal analysis, though could potentially expand on international law considerations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is one clear redundancy between SPEC 4 and SPEC 11 which are identical. However, appropriate redundancy exists in related but distinct areas (e.g., privacy protection across SPEC 4,6,8). Some consolidation opportunity exists but doesn't significantly impact effectiveness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance rigorous legal analysis with practical limitations (SPEC 10's recognition of insufficient context). Implementation would require sophisticated NLP capabilities but remains feasible. The specs adapt well to various legal contexts while maintaining consistent standards.\n\nTOTAL=88\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong overall quality with particularly high cohesion and coverage scores. The main area for improvement would be eliminating the duplicate specification and potentially consolidating closely related requirements while maintaining their distinct elements.",
