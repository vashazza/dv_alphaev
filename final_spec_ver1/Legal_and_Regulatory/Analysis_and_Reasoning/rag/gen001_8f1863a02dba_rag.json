    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework for legal analysis and compliance. They logically progress from fundamental principles (SPEC 1) through various aspects of legal reasoning (SPECS 2,3,5,7,9), while maintaining consistent focus on ethical boundaries (SPECS 4,6,8) and quality control (SPECS 7,10). The specs work together to create a comprehensive system for safe and responsible legal analysis.",
    "coverage": "The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key areas of legal analysis and compliance, including logical reasoning, privacy protection, unauthorized practice prevention, privilege preservation, and data handling. It addresses primary concerns (basic analysis), secondary issues (bias, context), and edge cases (temporal validity, insufficient information). The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. For example, privacy protection is addressed through multiple complementary angles (SPECS 4,8) without excessive duplication. The logical analysis requirements (SPECS 1,2,7,9) each focus on distinct aspects while supporting a common goal. The balance between unique coverage and reinforcing protection is well-maintained.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical usability, particularly in how they handle sensitive information and unauthorized practice concerns. The specs are adaptable to different legal contexts and provide clear guidance for implementation. The only slight limitation is the potential complexity of implementing some of the more sophisticated logical analysis requirements."
