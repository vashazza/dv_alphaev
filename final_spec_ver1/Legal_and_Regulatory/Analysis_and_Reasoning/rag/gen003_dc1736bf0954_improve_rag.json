  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal analysis and compliance. They logically build upon each other, from basic verification (Spec 1) through various analytical safeguards (Specs 2-4), to handling sensitive information (Specs 16,19). The policies consistently emphasize professional consultation while maintaining clear boundaries between education and advice.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal analysis domains, addressing jurisdictional issues, temporal considerations, confidentiality, regulatory compliance, and document handling. It covers primary scenarios (basic legal analysis), secondary concerns (temporal/jurisdictional context), and edge cases (privileged information, ongoing proceedings). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is some notable redundancy between Specs 16 and 19 regarding PII handling. Additionally, there's some overlap between Specs 8 and 11 regarding legal advice redirection. However, these redundancies appear intentional for critical areas, providing appropriate backup coverage for essential safety requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are clearly actionable and implementable, with concrete triggers and responses. They balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like educational content) when direct legal advice cannot be given. The requirements for clarification dialogues and confidence quantification are practical and maintainable. The only slight challenge might be in precisely implementing some of the more nuanced detection requirements."
