    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework for legal analysis and compliance. They logically progress from fundamental principles (SPEC 1) through specific analytical safeguards (SPEC 2, 9), privacy protections (SPEC 4, 8), and proper scope limitations (SPEC 6, 10). The specs work together to ensure both analytical rigor and legal compliance while maintaining appropriate boundaries.",
    "coverage": "The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key legal analysis domains including logical reasoning, privacy, unauthorized practice prevention, privilege protection, and data handling. It addresses primary risks (unauthorized practice, privacy breaches), secondary concerns (analytical quality), and edge cases (temporal validity, contextual interpretation). The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate reinforcement in critical areas. For example, privacy protection is addressed from multiple angles (SPEC 4, 8) but with distinct purposes. The logical analysis requirements (SPEC 1, 2, 9) complement rather than duplicate each other. The balance between unique coverage and strategic redundancy is well-maintained.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined (e.g., SPEC 6's specific indicators, SPEC 10's process for handling insufficient information). The policies balance security with usability by offering alternative approaches when restrictions apply. The framework appears adaptable to different legal contexts while maintaining consistent principles."
