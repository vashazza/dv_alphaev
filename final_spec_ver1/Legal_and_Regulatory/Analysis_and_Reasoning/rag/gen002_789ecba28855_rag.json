    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, particularly around handling uncertainty, jurisdictional scope, and data privacy. They form a coherent framework that progresses from foundational requirements (jurisdictional clarity, privilege protection) to specific analytical procedures. The specs consistently emphasize caution and clarity in legal analysis, with complementary approaches to handling ambiguity and uncertainty.",
    "coverage": "The policy group comprehensively covers major legal analysis scenarios including document review, contract analysis, regulatory compliance, tort analysis, and jurisdictional issues. It addresses both procedural safeguards and substantive analysis requirements. The inclusion of PII protection, privilege concerns, and pending litigation demonstrates strong attention to edge cases. Minor gaps exist in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and 16 regarding speculative interpretations), most redundancies appear intentional and serve to reinforce critical safety requirements. The repetition of uncertainty handling across different contexts (contracts, statutory interpretation, case law) is appropriate given the domain. However, some consolidation could improve efficiency, particularly around jurisdictional verification requirements.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. The balance between safety and functionality is well-maintained through the use of explicit markers, confidence levels, and clear disclaimers. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety principles. The technical feasibility of some automated detection requirements (SPEC 2, 17) might need further specification."
