  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal analysis and reasoning. They consistently emphasize professional consultation requirements (Specs 8, 11, 14), handle confidentiality concerns (Specs 12, 16), and maintain clear boundaries between education and advice (Specs 5, 13). The specs build upon each other logically, creating a robust system for handling legal queries while maintaining appropriate limitations.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across key legal analysis areas including jurisdictional considerations (Spec 4), temporal aspects (Specs 3, 6), confidentiality (Specs 12, 16), document handling (Spec 13), and regulatory compliance (Spec 14). It addresses both common scenarios and edge cases, from basic query handling to complex situations involving privileged information or ongoing legal proceedings. The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like emphasizing professional consultation and handling confidential information) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 5, 8, and 11 regarding legal advice boundaries, but this serves a purpose given the critical nature of these distinctions. The overlap between Specs 15 and 17 regarding uncertainty quantification could potentially be consolidated.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific triggers for different responses. The specs balance security and compliance needs with usability through structured clarification dialogues (Spec 7) and transparent methodology explanations (Spec 10). They provide practical frameworks for handling various scenarios while maintaining appropriate caution in legal contexts."
