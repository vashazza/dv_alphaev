    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for legal analysis and safety. They consistently build upon each other - from initial context gathering (Specs 3,4,7) to execution guidelines (Specs 1,2) to output safeguards (Specs 13,14,15). The policies maintain a coherent focus on distinguishing between education and advice while protecting against unauthorized practice of law.",
    "coverage": "The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across legal analysis scenarios, addressing input validation, processing requirements, output constraints, and risk mitigation. It covers crucial areas including jurisdictional issues, temporal aspects, confidentiality, privilege, regulatory compliance, and document generation. The only minor gap might be in handling cross-jurisdictional conflicts of law scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show strategic redundancy in critical areas (like preventing unauthorized legal advice - Specs 5,8,11) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some overlap between Specs 15 and 17 regarding uncertainty quantification, but this reinforces important principles. The redundancy appears intentional and serves to strengthen key safety requirements.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable criteria and specific behavioral guidelines. They balance security with usability through structured clarification dialogues and appropriate disclaimers. The specs provide concrete guidance for handling edge cases while remaining adaptable to different legal contexts and user expertise levels."
