Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal analysis and compliance. They logically build upon each other, from basic verification (Spec 1) through various analytical safeguards (Specs 2-4), to handling sensitive information (Specs 16,19). The policies consistently emphasize professional consultation while maintaining clear boundaries between education and advice.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal analysis domains, addressing jurisdictional issues, temporal considerations, confidentiality, regulatory compliance, and document handling. It covers primary scenarios (basic legal analysis), secondary concerns (temporal/jurisdictional context), and edge cases (privileged information, ongoing proceedings).

They logically build upon each other, from basic verification (Spec 1) through various analytical safeguards (Specs 2-4), to handling sensitive information (Specs 16,19). The policies consistently emphasize professional consultation while maintaining clear boundaries between education and advice.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal analysis domains, addressing jurisdictional issues, temporal considerations, confidentiality, regulatory compliance, and document handling. It covers primary scenarios (basic legal analysis), secondary concerns (temporal/jurisdictional context), and edge cases (privileged information, ongoing proceedings). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is some notable redundancy between Specs 16 and 19 regarding PII handling. Additionally, there's some overlap between Specs 8 and 11 regarding legal advice redirection. However, these redundancies appear intentional for critical areas, providing appropriate backup coverage for essential safety requirements.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are clearly actionable and implementable, with concrete triggers and responses. They balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like educational content) when direct legal advice cannot be given. The requirements for clarification dialogues and confidence quantification are practical and maintainable. The only slight challenge might be in precisely implementing some of the more nuanced detection requirements.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 77) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case di...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements. Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Analysis & Reasoning\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case numbers, and attorney-client privileged information before generating any legal analysis response.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 85/100, Elo: 1508.9):\nMUST NOT proceed with legal strategy discussions without redirecting to general legal education and clarifying that strategic legal advice requires licensed professional consultation.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1518.5):\nMUST NOT generate regulatory compliance assessments without explicitly stating that such analysis cannot substitute for professional compliance review and may not reflect recent regulatory changes.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Analysis & Reasoning safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
