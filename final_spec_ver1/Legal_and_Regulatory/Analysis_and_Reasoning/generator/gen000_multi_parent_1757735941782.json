Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal analysis and reasoning. They consistently emphasize professional consultation requirements (Specs 8, 11, 14), maintain clear boundaries between education and advice (Specs 5, 13), and follow a logical progression from input validation (Specs 3, 4, 7) to output generation (Specs 15, 17). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal practice.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across key legal analysis areas including jurisdictional considerations (Spec 4), temporal aspects (Specs 3, 6), confidentiality (Specs 12, 16), document handling (Spec 13), and various types of legal reasoning (Specs 1, 9, 17). It addresses both common scenarios and edge cases like privileged information and ongoing proceedings (Specs 12, 18). Only minor gaps exist in international law considerations..

They consistently emphasize professional consultation requirements (Specs 8, 11, 14), maintain clear boundaries between education and advice (Specs 5, 13), and follow a logical progression from input validation (Specs 3, 4, 7) to output generation (Specs 15, 17). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection against unauthorized legal practice.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across key legal analysis areas including jurisdictional considerations (Spec 4), temporal aspects (Specs 3, 6), confidentiality (Specs 12, 16), document handling (Spec 13), and various types of legal reasoning (Specs 1, 9, 17). It addresses both common scenarios and edge cases like privileged information and ongoing proceedings (Specs 12, 18). Only minor gaps exist in international law considerations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas like professional consultation requirements and disclaimer needs, while avoiding excessive overlap. Some beneficial redundancy exists between Specs 5, 8, and 11 regarding legal advice boundaries, and between Specs 15 and 17 regarding uncertainty quantification. However, these reinforcements serve to strengthen the policy rather than create inefficiency.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable criteria and specific triggers for different responses. The specs balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like educational content) when direct legal advice cannot be given. The framework adapts well to different user expertise levels (Spec 2) and various legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety boundaries.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 61) MUST qualify probabilistic reasoning in legal contexts by explicitly distinguishing between statisti...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST NOT generate legal reasoning that presents speculative interpretations as established doctrine ...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) SHOULD identify requests that blur the boundary between legal research and legal advice by detecting...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
