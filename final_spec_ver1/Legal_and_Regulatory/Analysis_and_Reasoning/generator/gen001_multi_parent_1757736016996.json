Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework for legal analysis and compliance. They logically progress from fundamental principles (SPEC 1) through specific analytical safeguards (SPEC 2, 9), privacy protections (SPEC 4, 8), and proper scope limitations (SPEC 6, 10). The specs work together to ensure both analytical rigor and legal compliance while maintaining appropriate boundaries.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key legal analysis domains including logical reasoning, privacy, unauthorized practice prevention, privilege protection, and data handling. It addresses primary risks (unauthorized practice, privacy breaches), secondary concerns (analytical quality), and edge cases (temporal validity, contextual interpretation). The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional considerations.. Target Spec: MUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, inc...

They logically progress from fundamental principles (SPEC 1) through specific analytical safeguards (SPEC 2, 9), privacy protections (SPEC 4, 8), and proper scope limitations (SPEC 6, 10). The specs work together to ensure both analytical rigor and legal compliance while maintaining appropriate boundaries.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across key legal analysis domains including logical reasoning, privacy, unauthorized practice prevention, privilege protection, and data handling. It addresses primary risks (unauthorized practice, privacy breaches), secondary concerns (analytical quality), and edge cases (temporal validity, contextual interpretation). The only minor gap might be in cross-jurisdictional considerations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate reinforcement in critical areas. For example, privacy protection is addressed from multiple angles (SPEC 4, 8) but with distinct purposes. The logical analysis requirements (SPEC 1, 2, 9) complement rather than duplicate each other. The balance between unique coverage and strategic redundancy is well-maintained.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined (e.g., SPEC 6's specific indicators, SPEC 10's process for handling insufficient information). The policies balance security with usability by offering alternative approaches when restrictions apply. The framework appears adaptable to different legal contexts while maintaining consistent principles.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, inc...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) SHOULD detect requests for legal reasoning that may involve privileged or confidential information b...\n  - [3] (Score: 67) MUST maintain logical traceability by documenting each inferential step when building complex legal ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
