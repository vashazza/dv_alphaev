  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal code generation from multiple complementary angles. They consistently emphasize human oversight, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance while maintaining logical connections between different aspects (e.g., research, contracts, litigation support). The specs build upon each other well, with research validation (Spec 2) supporting contract automation (Spec 1) and litigation support (Spec 12).. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas like contract automation, legal research, compliance, litigation support, and billing. It covers both primary concerns (e.g., confidentiality, jurisdiction) and edge cases (e.g., ethical walls, fair use limitations). The inclusion of PII protection, version control, and bias detection shows thorough consideration of secondary risks.. Redundancy: The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas (e.g., multiple specs addressing confidentiality and authentication) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some beneficial overlap between Specs 2 and 13 regarding citation validation, and between Specs 4 and 16 on case prediction, but these reinforce important principles rather than create waste. The redundancy appears intentional and strategic.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable items and specific validation steps. They balance security needs with practical usage (e.g., Spec 7's human review requirement). The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions, and provide concrete guidance while maintaining flexibility. The emphasis on interactive questioning and human oversight makes implementation realistic..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across various legal technology domains including contr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, including contract a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal techno...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal technology scenarios, including client intake, docu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite requests for client intake automation into privacy-compliant data collection systems with attorney-client p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive leg...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal code generation from multiple complementary angles.
