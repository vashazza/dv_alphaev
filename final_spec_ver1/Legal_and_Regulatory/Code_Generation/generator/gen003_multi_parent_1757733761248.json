  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They logically progress from initial request validation (Spec 1) through various specialized legal contexts, with consistent themes of authorization verification, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance. The specs reference and build upon each other well, particularly in areas like PII protection, document automation, and ethical considerations.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas like court filings, client intake, contract automation, discovery management, and unauthorized practice prevention. It covers both technical aspects (SQL injection, data security) and legal-specific concerns (attorney-client privilege, bar association compliance). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between Specs 4 and 19 regarding PII masking, most redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for critical areas. The specs efficiently consolidate related requirements while maintaining appropriate redundancy for crucial safety aspects like authorization verification and ethical compliance. The overlap between Specs 6 and 13 regarding judicial decision-making automation serves as useful reinforcement.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with practical usability, particularly in areas like client intake automation and document management. The specs are adaptable to different legal contexts and jurisdictions, though some might require additional resources for full implementation. The verification and clarification requirements are realistic and implementable..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across various legal technology domains including contr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, including contract a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal techno...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal technology scenarios, including client intake, docu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite requests for client intake automation into privacy-compliant data collection systems with attorney-client p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive leg...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety.
