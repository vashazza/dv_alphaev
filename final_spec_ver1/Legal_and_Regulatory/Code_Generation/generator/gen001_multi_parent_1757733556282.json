Average group score: 86.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The policies complement each other well, with each addressing a distinct but related aspect of legal code generation.. Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions.

They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The policies complement each other well, with each addressing a distinct but related aspect of legal code generation.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be additional coverage for areas like client confidentiality, data privacy, and conflict checking in legal applications. The focus on judicial processes is strong, but other legal practice areas could be addressed.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show minimal redundancy while maintaining appropriate emphasis on critical areas. Each specification addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation without overlap. The requirements are efficiently stated and avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage of critical safety concerns.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance (e.g., format compliance checking, human review checkpoints). They balance automation benefits with necessary safeguards. The specifications are adaptable to different jurisdictions and court systems, though some may require local customization.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rathe...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate code that automates attorney signature processes, legal document execution, or not...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against spe...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains. Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Code Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 63/100, Elo: 1501.2):\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 86/100, Elo: 1511.5):\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 76/100, Elo: 1510.0):\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Code Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
