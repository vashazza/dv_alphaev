  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They consistently address key themes like confidentiality (SPEC 6, 12, 18), ethical compliance (SPEC 3, 15, 17), and proper validation (SPEC 1, 2, 13). The policies build upon each other effectively, creating layers of protection across different aspects of legal automation.. Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across multiple legal technology domains including contract automation, research tools, compliance systems, and litigation support. It addresses primary concerns (basic functionality), secondary issues (ethical considerations), and edge cases (potential misuse scenarios). The specs cover both proactive measures (SPEC 5's jurisdictional context) and reactive safeguards (SPEC 7's human review requirements).. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and 13 regarding citation verification, SPEC 4 and 16 on case prediction), the redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical areas. The overlap provides necessary reinforcement for crucial safety aspects while maintaining distinct focuses. Some consolidation could be considered for research-related specs, but the current structure maintains clarity.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific validation steps and implementation guidance. The policies balance security needs with practical usability, incorporating human oversight where appropriate (SPEC 15) and providing specific technical requirements (SPEC 18's PII masking). The framework appears adaptable to different legal practice contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across various legal technology domains including contr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, including contract a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal techno...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal technology scenarios, including client intake, docu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite requests for client intake automation into privacy-compliant data collection systems with attorney-client p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive leg...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety.
