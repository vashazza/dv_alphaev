  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They logically build upon each other, addressing interconnected aspects of legal technology from client intake (Spec 3) through document automation (Spec 15) to final execution (Spec 11). The specs consistently emphasize verification, authorization, and compliance while maintaining clear thematic connections around attorney oversight, client privacy, and ethical boundaries.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across the legal technology landscape, addressing crucial areas like client privacy (Spec 4), court filing (Spec 7), discovery management (Spec 9), and unauthorized practice prevention (Spec 14). It covers both technical aspects (SQL injection, data security) and legal-specific concerns (attorney-client privilege, bar requirements). The inclusion of edge cases like timestamp manipulation (Spec 17) and conflict checking (Spec 18) demonstrates thorough risk consideration.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like verification and authorization) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 6 and 13 regarding judicial decision-making automation, but this appears strategic rather than wasteful. The policies efficiently consolidate related concerns while maintaining necessary emphasis on crucial safety aspects.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific technical considerations. They balance security needs with practical usage, incorporating real-world legal practice requirements like bar association guidelines (Spec 10) and malpractice insurance verification (Spec 16). The specs provide concrete guidance while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions and practice contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across various legal technology domains including contr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, including contract a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal techno...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of legal technology scenarios, including client intake, docu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite requests for client intake automation into privacy-compliant data collection systems with attorney-client p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive leg...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety.
