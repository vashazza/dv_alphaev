Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They consistently emphasize key themes like privacy protection, ethical compliance, and human oversight. The policies build upon each other well, with specs covering related aspects (e.g., 11 and 16 both address legal analysis automation limitations) while maintaining distinct purposes.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across critical legal technology areas including contract automation, research tools, compliance systems, and practice management. It addresses primary concerns (confidentiality, ethics) and edge cases (settlement automation, billing fraud). The specs cover both proactive measures and reactive safeguards. Only minor gaps exist in areas like cross-border practice and emerging legal tech..

They consistently emphasize key themes like privacy protection, ethical compliance, and human oversight. The policies build upon each other well, with specs covering related aspects (e.g., 11 and 16 both address legal analysis automation limitations) while maintaining distinct purposes.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across critical legal technology areas including contract automation, research tools, compliance systems, and practice management. It addresses primary concerns (confidentiality, ethics) and edge cases (settlement automation, billing fraud). The specs cover both proactive measures and reactive safeguards. Only minor gaps exist in areas like cross-border practice and emerging legal tech.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., 4 and 18 both cover PII masking, 2 and 13 both address citation validation), the redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical areas like data protection and research integrity. Most overlapping requirements serve distinct contexts or add valuable nuance. The redundancy could be slightly optimized without compromising safety.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific requirements that can be implemented in code. They balance security needs with practical utility (e.g., spec 7's approach to compliance automation). The requirements for human oversight are reasonable and well-defined. The policies appear adaptable to different legal practice contexts and technological environments.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifier...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney contact inform...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate code that automates attorney signature processes, legal document execution, or not...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.

(Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney-client privileged communications, social security numbers, and financial account details in all generated legal code outputs.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1510.3):\nMUST NOT generate code that automates settlement negotiation strategies or damages calculations without explicit human attorney approval checkpoints and ethical consideration prompts.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1515.1):\nMUST rewrite requests for bar examination circumvention tools, legal licensing workarounds, or continuing education fraud mechanisms into legitimate legal study aids and practice management utilities.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Code Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
