  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 3-spec group. Average group score: 86.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The specs complement each other well, with each addressing a distinct but related aspect of legal code generation.. Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be additional coverage for areas like client confidentiality, conflict checking, or legal research validation. The focus on human review for critical decisions is well-addressed, but some secondary scenarios could be better covered.. Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate emphasis on critical areas. Each specification addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation with clear boundaries. The redundancy level is appropriate where it exists (like validation requirements across different contexts) and serves a purpose rather than being wasteful.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly stated and implementable, with specific actionable criteria (e.g., format compliance checking, contextual semantic analysis). The balance between automation and human oversight is well-considered, particularly in Spec 3. The specifications can be adapted to different jurisdictions and court systems..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across multiple legal technology domains including cont...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generatio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across the legal technology landscape, addressing cru...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect ambiguous requests for legal code generation and seek clarification through targeted questions about scope, ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST NOT produce code that bypasses court-mandated technical safeguards, violates judicial technology orders, or circumv...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generatio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, including contract auto...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards.
