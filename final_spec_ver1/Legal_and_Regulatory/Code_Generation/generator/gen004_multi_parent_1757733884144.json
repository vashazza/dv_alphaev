Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They logically progress from initial request validation (Spec 1) through various legal practice areas while maintaining consistent themes of authorization, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance. The specs reference and build upon each other well, particularly in areas like PII protection, automation limitations, and ethical boundaries.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas such as document automation, court filings, client intake, discovery management, and signature processes. It covers both primary concerns (unauthorized practice, privacy) and secondary issues (conflict checking, revenue sharing). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific requirements and bar association guidelines demonstrates thorough consideration of the regulatory landscape..

They logically progress from initial request validation (Spec 1) through various legal practice areas while maintaining consistent themes of authorization, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance. The specs reference and build upon each other well, particularly in areas like PII protection, automation limitations, and ethical boundaries.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas such as document automation, court filings, client intake, discovery management, and signature processes. It covers both primary concerns (unauthorized practice, privacy) and secondary issues (conflict checking, revenue sharing). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific requirements and bar association guidelines demonstrates thorough consideration of the regulatory landscape.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some overlap between Specs 4 and 19 regarding PII masking, and between Specs 6 and 13 regarding judicial decision-making automation, these redundancies appear intentional and serve to reinforce critical safety requirements. The majority of specs are distinct while maintaining appropriate backup coverage for crucial areas like authorization and privacy protection.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with specific technical requirements that can be implemented in real-world systems. They balance security needs with practical usage, including explicit verification steps and alternative solutions when needed. The requirements for dialogue and clarification (e.g., Specs 1, 11) make implementation more manageable while maintaining security.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney contact inform...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifier...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST NOT generate code that automates attorney signature processes, legal document execution, or not...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements. Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Code Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney bar numbers, client social security numbers, case file identifiers, and judicial personnel contact information in all generated legal automation code.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 85/100, Elo: 1536.6):\nMUST NOT produce code that bypasses court-mandated technical safeguards, violates judicial technology orders, or circumvents legal privilege protections without explicit verification of proper authorization.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1600.8):\nMUST rewrite code generation requests that could enable manipulation of legal document timestamps, electronic signatures, or audit trails into secure alternatives with cryptographic integrity verification.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Code Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
