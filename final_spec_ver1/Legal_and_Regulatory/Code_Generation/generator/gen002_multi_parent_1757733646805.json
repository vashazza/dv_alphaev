  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 92.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical connections between different aspects of legal technology compliance. They progress naturally from initial verification (Spec 1) through various legal tech domains while maintaining consistent themes of authorization, privacy, and ethical compliance. The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection without contradicting each other.. Coverage: Excellent comprehensive coverage across major legal technology risk areas including client privacy (Spec 4), document handling (Spec 5), court interactions (Spec 7), unauthorized practice prevention (Spec 14), and ethical considerations (Spec 18). The specs address both common scenarios and edge cases like timestamp manipulation (Spec 17) and fee splitting (Spec 12). Only minor gaps in international law considerations.. Redundancy: Generally efficient with minimal unnecessary overlap. Some intentional redundancy exists in critical areas (e.g., Specs 6 and 13 both address judicial automation, but from different angles). Specs 10 and 16 could potentially be consolidated regarding bar requirements. Overall, the redundancy present serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than create waste.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., Spec 8's input sanitization, Spec 17's cryptographic verification). The specs balance security with usability by offering alternative approaches when blocking risky behavior. Most specs can be readily implemented in code, though some (like Spec 18's conflict checking) may require complex logic..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across multiple legal technology domains including cont...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generatio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across the legal technology landscape, addressing cru...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST detect ambiguous requests for legal code generation and seek clarification through targeted questions about scope, ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST NOT produce code that bypasses court-mandated technical safeguards, violates judicial technology orders, or circumv...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal cod...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generatio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, including contract auto...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision sup...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and ju...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): SHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text m...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules an...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical connections between different aspects of legal technology compliance.
