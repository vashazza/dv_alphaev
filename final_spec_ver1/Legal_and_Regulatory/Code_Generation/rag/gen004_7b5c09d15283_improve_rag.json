    "cohesion": "The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The policies complement each other well, with each addressing a distinct but related aspect of legal code generation.",
    "coverage": "The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be additional coverage for areas like client confidentiality, conflict checking, or legal research validation. The focus on human review for critical decisions is well-addressed, but some secondary scenarios could be better detailed.",
    "redundancy": "Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation with minimal overlap. The requirements are efficiently stated and avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining appropriate emphasis on critical safety aspects. The separation between document handling, filing requirements, and judicial decision support is clear and well-defined.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly stated and implementable. The court filing spec provides concrete validation criteria, and the human review requirement for judicial decisions is specific and actionable. The document comparison requirement could be more specific about implementation standards, but overall the group maintains good balance between security and usability."
