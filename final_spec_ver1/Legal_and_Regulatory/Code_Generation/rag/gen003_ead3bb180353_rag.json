  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They logically build upon each other, addressing interconnected aspects of legal technology from client intake (Spec 3) through document automation (Spec 15) to final execution (Spec 11). The specs consistently emphasize verification, authorization, and compliance while maintaining clear thematic connections around attorney oversight, client privacy, and ethical boundaries.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across the legal technology landscape, addressing crucial areas like client privacy (Spec 4), court filing (Spec 7), discovery management (Spec 9), and unauthorized practice prevention (Spec 14). It covers both technical aspects (SQL injection, data security) and legal-specific concerns (attorney-client privilege, bar requirements). The inclusion of edge cases like timestamp manipulation (Spec 17) and conflict checking (Spec 18) demonstrates thorough risk consideration.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like verification and authorization) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between Specs 6 and 13 regarding judicial decision-making automation, but this appears strategic rather than wasteful. The policies efficiently consolidate related concerns while maintaining necessary emphasis on crucial safety aspects.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific technical considerations. They balance security needs with practical usage, incorporating real-world legal practice requirements like bar association guidelines (Spec 10) and malpractice insurance verification (Spec 16). The specs provide concrete guidance while remaining adaptable to different jurisdictions and practice contexts."
