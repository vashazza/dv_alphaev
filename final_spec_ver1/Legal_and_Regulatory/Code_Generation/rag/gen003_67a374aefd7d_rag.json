    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They consistently address key themes like confidentiality (SPEC 6, 12, 18), ethical compliance (SPEC 3, 15, 17), and proper validation (SPEC 1, 2, 13). The policies build upon each other effectively, creating layers of protection across different aspects of legal automation.",
    "coverage": "The policy group exhibits excellent coverage across multiple legal technology domains including contract automation, research tools, compliance systems, and litigation support. It addresses primary concerns (basic functionality), secondary issues (ethical considerations), and edge cases (potential misuse scenarios). The specs cover both proactive measures (SPEC 5's jurisdictional context) and reactive safeguards (SPEC 7's human review requirements).",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and 13 regarding citation verification, SPEC 4 and 16 on case prediction), the redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical areas. The overlap provides necessary reinforcement for crucial safety aspects while maintaining distinct focuses. Some consolidation could be considered for research-related specs, but the current structure maintains clarity.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific validation steps and implementation guidance. The policies balance security needs with practical usability, incorporating human oversight where appropriate (SPEC 15) and providing specific technical requirements (SPEC 18's PII masking). The framework appears adaptable to different legal practice contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards."
