  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They logically progress from initial request validation (Spec 1) through various legal practice areas while maintaining consistent themes of authorization, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance. The specs reference and build upon each other well, particularly in areas like PII protection, automation limitations, and ethical boundaries.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas such as document automation, court filings, client intake, discovery management, and signature processes. It covers both primary concerns (unauthorized practice, privacy) and secondary issues (conflict checking, revenue sharing). The inclusion of jurisdiction-specific requirements and bar association guidelines demonstrates thorough consideration of the regulatory landscape.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 4 and 19 regarding PII masking, and between Specs 6 and 13 regarding judicial decision-making automation, these redundancies appear intentional and serve to reinforce critical safety requirements. The majority of specs are distinct while maintaining appropriate backup coverage for crucial areas like authorization and privacy protection.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with specific technical requirements that can be implemented in real-world systems. They balance security needs with practical usage, including explicit verification steps and alternative solutions when needed. The requirements for dialogue and clarification (e.g., Specs 1, 11) make implementation more manageable while maintaining security."
