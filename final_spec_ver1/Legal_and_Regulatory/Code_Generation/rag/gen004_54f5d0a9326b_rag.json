    "cohesion": "The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The specs complement each other well, with each addressing a distinct but related aspect of legal code generation.",
    "coverage": "The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be additional coverage for areas like client confidentiality, conflict checking, or legal research validation. The focus on human review for critical decisions is well-addressed, but some secondary scenarios could be better covered.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate emphasis on critical areas. Each specification addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation with clear boundaries. The redundancy level is appropriate where it exists (like validation requirements across different contexts) and serves a purpose rather than being wasteful.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly stated and implementable, with specific actionable criteria (e.g., format compliance checking, contextual semantic analysis). The balance between automation and human oversight is well-considered, particularly in Spec 3. The specifications can be adapted to different jurisdictions and court systems."
