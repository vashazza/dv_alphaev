    "cohesion": "The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The policies complement each other well, with each addressing a distinct but related aspect of legal code generation.",
    "coverage": "The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be additional coverage for areas like client confidentiality, data privacy, and conflict checking in legal applications. The focus on judicial processes is strong, but other legal practice areas could be addressed.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal redundancy while maintaining appropriate emphasis on critical areas. Each specification addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation without overlap. The requirements are efficiently stated and avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage of critical safety concerns.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance (e.g., format compliance checking, human review checkpoints). They balance automation benefits with necessary safeguards. The specifications are adaptable to different jurisdictions and court systems, though some may require local customization."
