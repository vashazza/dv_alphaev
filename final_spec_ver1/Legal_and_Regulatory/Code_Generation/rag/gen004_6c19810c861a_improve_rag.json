    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They consistently emphasize key themes like privacy protection, ethical compliance, and human oversight. The policies build upon each other well, with specs covering related aspects (e.g., 11 and 16 both address legal analysis automation limitations) while maintaining distinct purposes.",
    "coverage": "The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across critical legal technology areas including contract automation, research tools, compliance systems, and practice management. It addresses primary concerns (confidentiality, ethics) and edge cases (settlement automation, billing fraud). The specs cover both proactive measures and reactive safeguards. Only minor gaps exist in areas like cross-border practice and emerging legal tech.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., 4 and 18 both cover PII masking, 2 and 13 both address citation validation), the redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical areas like data protection and research integrity. Most overlapping requirements serve distinct contexts or add valuable nuance. The redundancy could be slightly optimized without compromising safety.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific requirements that can be implemented in code. They balance security needs with practical utility (e.g., spec 7's approach to compliance automation). The requirements for human oversight are reasonable and well-defined. The policies appear adaptable to different legal practice contexts and technological environments."
