    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses legal code generation from multiple complementary angles. They consistently emphasize human oversight, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance while maintaining logical connections between different aspects (e.g., research, contracts, litigation support). The specs build upon each other well, with research validation (Spec 2) supporting contract automation (Spec 1) and litigation support (Spec 12).",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas like contract automation, legal research, compliance, litigation support, and billing. It covers both primary concerns (e.g., confidentiality, jurisdiction) and edge cases (e.g., ethical walls, fair use limitations). The inclusion of PII protection, version control, and bias detection shows thorough consideration of secondary risks.",
    "redundancy": "The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas (e.g., multiple specs addressing confidentiality and authentication) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some beneficial overlap between Specs 2 and 13 regarding citation validation, and between Specs 4 and 16 on case prediction, but these reinforce important principles rather than create waste. The redundancy appears intentional and strategic.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable items and specific validation steps. They balance security needs with practical usage (e.g., Spec 7's human review requirement). The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions, and provide concrete guidance while maintaining flexibility. The emphasis on interactive questioning and human oversight makes implementation realistic."
