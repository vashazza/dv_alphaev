    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical connections between different aspects of legal technology compliance. They progress naturally from initial verification (Spec 1) through various legal tech domains while maintaining consistent themes of authorization, privacy, and ethical compliance. The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection without contradicting each other.",
    "coverage": "Excellent comprehensive coverage across major legal technology risk areas including client privacy (Spec 4), document handling (Spec 5), court interactions (Spec 7), unauthorized practice prevention (Spec 14), and ethical considerations (Spec 18). The specs address both common scenarios and edge cases like timestamp manipulation (Spec 17) and fee splitting (Spec 12). Only minor gaps in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "Generally efficient with minimal unnecessary overlap. Some intentional redundancy exists in critical areas (e.g., Specs 6 and 13 both address judicial automation, but from different angles). Specs 10 and 16 could potentially be consolidated regarding bar requirements. Overall, the redundancy present serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than create waste.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance (e.g., Spec 8's input sanitization, Spec 17's cryptographic verification). The specs balance security with usability by offering alternative approaches when blocking risky behavior. Most specs can be readily implemented in code, though some (like Spec 18's conflict checking) may require complex logic."
