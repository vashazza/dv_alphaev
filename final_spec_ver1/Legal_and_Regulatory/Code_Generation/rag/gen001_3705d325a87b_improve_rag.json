    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They consistently address key themes like confidentiality (SPEC 6, 12, 18), ethical compliance (SPEC 3, 8, 17), and human oversight (SPEC 7, 11, 15). The specs build upon each other logically, creating a multi-layered approach to legal automation safety.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, including contract automation, research tools, compliance systems, litigation support, and practice management. It addresses both obvious risks (unauthorized practice, confidentiality breaches) and subtle concerns (bias detection, fair use compliance). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations beyond jurisdictional awareness.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like verification and validation) while avoiding excessive overlap. There is some intentional reinforcement between SPECS 2/13 (citation verification) and SPECS 4/16 (case prediction), but these instances strengthen rather than duplicate protection. The redundancy appears strategic rather than wasteful.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security with usability by offering constructive alternatives to prohibited actions (SPEC 3, 7, 16). The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and firm sizes. The only slight challenge might be implementing some of the more complex validation requirements in smaller practices."
