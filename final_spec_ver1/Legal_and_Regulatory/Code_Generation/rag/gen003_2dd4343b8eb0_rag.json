    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They logically progress from initial request validation (Spec 1) through various specialized legal contexts, with consistent themes of authorization verification, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance. The specs reference and build upon each other well, particularly in areas like PII protection, document automation, and ethical considerations.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal technology domains, addressing key areas like court filings, client intake, contract automation, discovery management, and unauthorized practice prevention. It covers both technical aspects (SQL injection, data security) and legal-specific concerns (attorney-client privilege, bar association compliance). The only minor gap might be in international law considerations.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 4 and 19 regarding PII masking, most redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for critical areas. The specs efficiently consolidate related requirements while maintaining appropriate redundancy for crucial safety aspects like authorization verification and ethical compliance. The overlap between Specs 6 and 13 regarding judicial decision-making automation serves as useful reinforcement.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with practical usability, particularly in areas like client intake automation and document management. The specs are adaptable to different legal contexts and jurisdictions, though some might require additional resources for full implementation. The verification and clarification requirements are realistic and implementable."
