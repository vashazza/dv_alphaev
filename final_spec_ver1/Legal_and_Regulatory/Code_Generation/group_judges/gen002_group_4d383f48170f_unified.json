    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 54.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b46addee0edc, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, and sensitive legal identifiers in all generated legal code outputs.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ac125d7b1049, Score: 76)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81192e026bcf, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal code generation safety. Spec 1's PII protection naturally complements Spec 2's court filing requirements, while Spec 3's human oversight requirement aligns well with the overall compliance and safety theme. The progression from data protection to format validation to human oversight creates a logical safety chain.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22\nComment: The group addresses key risk areas in legal code generation: data privacy (Spec 1), technical compliance (Spec 2), and ethical boundaries (Spec 3). It covers both automated processes and human oversight requirements. The only minor gap might be in addressing version control or audit trail requirements for legal code changes.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate reinforcement in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal code generation safety. The PII protection in Spec 1 appropriately complements but doesn't duplicate the compliance checking in Spec 2 or the human oversight requirements in Spec 3.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly defined and implementable. PII masking and format compliance checking are standard practices, and the human review checkpoint requirement is straightforward to implement. The specs balance automation with necessary human oversight, though they might benefit from more specific guidance on implementation timing and methods.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group demonstrates excellent cohesion and appropriate coverage of legal code generation risks while maintaining efficiency and practicality. The high score reflects its well-structured approach to combining automated safety measures with necessary human oversight in legal applications.",
