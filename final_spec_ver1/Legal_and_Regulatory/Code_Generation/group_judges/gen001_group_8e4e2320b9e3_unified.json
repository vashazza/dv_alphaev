    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 54.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b46addee0edc, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, and sensitive legal identifiers in all generated legal code outputs.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ac125d7b1049, Score: 76)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81192e026bcf, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal code generation safety. Spec 1's PII protection naturally complements Spec 2's court filing compliance, while Spec 3's human oversight requirement creates a logical safety chain. They work together to ensure both data privacy and procedural compliance while maintaining human control over critical legal decisions.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22\nComment: The group addresses key risk areas in legal code generation: data privacy (Spec 1), procedural compliance (Spec 2), and algorithmic decision-making safeguards (Spec 3). It covers both automated processes and human oversight requirements. Minor gaps might exist around document retention policies and audit trail requirements.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate reinforcement in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of legal code generation safety. The interaction between automated compliance checking (Spec 2) and human review requirements (Spec 3) provides beneficial redundancy for critical legal processes.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly defined and implementable. PII masking (Spec 1) and format compliance checking (Spec 2) can be automated effectively. The human review requirement (Spec 3) creates a clear checkpoint system. The specifications are adaptable across different jurisdictions and court systems, though implementation complexity might be high.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional cohesion and balanced coverage of legal code generation risks while maintaining practical implementability. The high score reflects its effectiveness as a unified compliance framework for legal automation systems.",
