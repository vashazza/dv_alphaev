    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 4 specs, Avg Score: 56.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ac125d7b1049, Score: 76)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81192e026bcf, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 01ae38e0b195, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney-client privileged communications, social security numbers, and case-sensitive personal identifiers in all generated legal code outputs.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal code generation safety. They progress logically from document analysis (Spec 1) to filing automation (Spec 2) to judicial decision support limitations (Spec 3) and data privacy (Spec 4). The requirements complement each other well, creating a comprehensive chain of safeguards for legal automation.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group addresses key risk areas in legal code generation including document analysis, court filing compliance, judicial decision automation, and privacy protection. It covers both procedural requirements (filing formats) and substantive safeguards (human review, PII protection). The only minor gap might be in version control and audit trail requirements for legal document modifications.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. For example, while Specs 1 and 2 both deal with document processing, they address distinct aspects (comparison vs. filing). The PII protection requirement in Spec 4 appropriately spans all outputs, providing necessary cross-cutting coverage.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable with current technology. They provide specific, measurable criteria (e.g., court rules compliance, PII detection) while remaining flexible enough for different jurisdictions and contexts. The human review requirement for judicial decisions strikes a good balance between automation and safety.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional cohesion and comprehensive coverage of legal code generation risks, with practical implementation guidance and efficient use of redundancy. The high score reflects its effectiveness as a unified framework for ensuring safe and compliant legal automation.",
