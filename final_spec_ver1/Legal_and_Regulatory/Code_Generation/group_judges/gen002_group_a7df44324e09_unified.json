    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 75.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ac125d7b1049, Score: 76)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81192e026bcf, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=25\nComment: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share an underlying theme of ensuring accurate legal processing while maintaining appropriate human oversight. The policies complement each other well, with no apparent conflicts.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20\nComment: The specs address key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be better coverage of privacy/confidentiality requirements and data retention policies specific to legal documents. The focus on judicial review for sensitive decisions is well-specified.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs are efficiently stated with minimal overlap. Each addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation while maintaining appropriate emphasis on validation and compliance. The redundancy in validation requirements across specs is justified given the critical nature of legal applications.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and specific enough for implementation. The court filing spec explicitly references jurisdiction-specific requirements, making it highly practical. The human review checkpoint requirement for judicial decisions provides a clear implementation guideline. The document comparison requirement could be more specific about validation criteria.\n\nTOTAL=86\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong cohesion and appropriate redundancy while maintaining good practical implementability. While coverage could be expanded in some areas, the existing specs effectively address critical aspects of legal automation safety and compliance.",
