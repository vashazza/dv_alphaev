    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 75.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ac125d7b1049, Score: 76)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81192e026bcf, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=25\nComment: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The specs complement each other well, with no conflicts between requirements.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20\nComment: The specs address key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be additional coverage for areas like client data privacy, attorney review requirements, or conflict checking procedures. The focus on judicial processes is strong but could be broader for comprehensive legal tech coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs are efficiently stated with minimal overlap. Each addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation while maintaining appropriate emphasis on validation and compliance checking where needed. The redundancy in human oversight requirements across specs is appropriate given the critical nature of legal processes.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance (e.g., \"contextual semantic analysis,\" \"format compliance checking\"). They balance automation benefits with necessary human oversight. The specifications can be readily adapted to different jurisdictions and court systems.\n\nTOTAL=86\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong cohesion and efficient specification design, with good practicality for implementation. While coverage could be broader, the existing specs effectively address their targeted areas of legal automation risk.",
