    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 75.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ac125d7b1049, Score: 76)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81192e026bcf, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=25\nComment: The specs form a logical progression from document analysis to court filing to judicial decision support, creating a coherent framework for legal automation safeguards. They share a common theme of ensuring accuracy and human oversight in legal processes. The policies complement each other well, with each addressing a distinct but related aspect of legal code generation.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20\nComment: The specs cover key risk areas in legal automation, from document comparison to court filings and judicial decisions. However, there could be additional coverage for areas like client confidentiality, data privacy, and conflict checking in legal applications. The focus on judicial processes is strong, but other legal practice areas could be addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs show minimal redundancy while maintaining appropriate emphasis on critical areas. Each specification addresses a distinct aspect of legal automation without overlap. The requirements are efficiently stated and avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage of critical safety concerns.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance (e.g., format compliance checking, human review checkpoints). They balance automation benefits with necessary safeguards. The specifications are adaptable to different jurisdictions and court systems, though some may require local customization.\n\nTOTAL=86\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong cohesion and efficient non-redundant coverage, with clear practical implementation guidance. While there are some gaps in coverage, the existing specs form a solid foundation for legal code generation safety requirements.",
