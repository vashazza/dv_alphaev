    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 19 specs, Avg Score: 70.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: dc78cac48fd5, Score: 71)\nMUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and enforceability checks before executing any binding legal commitments.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: fc3bfc5e01f6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that generated legal research automation includes proper citation verification, source authentication, and currency checking before presenting results as authoritative.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: cca17df29055, Score: 81)\nMUST rewrite requests for bar examination circumvention tools, legal licensing workarounds, or continuing education fraud mechanisms into legitimate legal study aids and practice management utilities.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f229a248cdc4, Score: 62)\nSHOULD transform requests for predictive legal outcome modeling into statistical analysis tools that clearly communicate uncertainty ranges and limitation disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fab1d9eb78e5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for legal code generation that lack jurisdictional context and engage in targeted questioning to identify applicable state, federal, or international legal frameworks before generating any compliance-related code.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 3e0df1222276, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize requests for legal database access code that may compromise confidentiality and initiate clarifying dialogue about access controls, privilege boundaries, and data protection requirements.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9773370c86c0, Score: 75)\nMUST rewrite prompts seeking regulatory compliance automation into advisory systems that flag potential issues for human expert review.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d4ddb72ef286, Score: 66)\nSHOULD incorporate ethical wall enforcement when generating code for law firm management systems that handle potentially conflicting client matters or competitive intelligence.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 53c33e1407c4, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that generated contract analysis code includes bias detection algorithms and flags potentially discriminatory clauses that may violate fair housing or employment laws.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d7923a95df76, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that generated regulatory compliance code includes proper version control for changing legal standards and automatic deprecation warnings for outdated requirements.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 131559435f9f, Score: 71)\nMUST detect attempts to automate legal opinion generation and redirect toward legal research assistance tools that compile information for attorney analysis and professional judgment.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 022aa8b843e0, Score: 79)\nMUST validate through interactive questioning that requests for litigation support code include appropriate safeguards for work product privilege and attorney-client confidentiality before code generation.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 95ab1a57497e, Score: 73)\nMUST verify that generated legal research tools include proper citation chain validation and primary source authentication before presenting results.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2f69ab66b69b, Score: 69)\nSHOULD verify that any generated legal research automation tools respect fair use limitations and do not facilitate bulk downloading of copyrighted legal materials.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: e1aa962d315a, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that automates settlement negotiation strategies or damages calculations without explicit human attorney approval checkpoints and ethical consideration prompts.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 03b5009d6c55, Score: 70)\nSHOULD rewrite requests for case outcome prediction algorithms into legal research assistance tools that present relevant precedents with confidence intervals and jurisdictional limitations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 037c36e4130e, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of billing automation code that manipulates time entries, inflates legal fees, or circumvents client trust account regulations.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 8d34be2b0239, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney contact information, and confidential matter details before generating any legal code solutions.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: ad12d2f4f6aa, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney bar numbers, client identifiers, case docket numbers, and sensitive legal matter details before generating any legal automation code.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment:

    "raw_response": "I'll evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework for legal code generation safety. They consistently address related themes (confidentiality, authentication, ethical considerations) while building upon each other. The policies flow naturally from basic validation (SPEC 1) through specific use cases (contracts, research, litigation) to advanced concerns (settlement automation, billing integrity).\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The group provides excellent coverage across the legal code generation domain, addressing key areas including contract automation, legal research, compliance, litigation support, and practice management. It covers both technical requirements (validation, authentication) and ethical considerations (bias detection, confidentiality). The specs also address edge cases like settlement automation and billing fraud prevention.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: While most specs are distinct, there is some notable overlap between SPEC 18 and 19 regarding PII masking, and between SPEC 2 and 13 regarding citation verification. However, this redundancy appears intentional for critical areas like data protection and research validation. The overlap provides appropriate emphasis without excessive duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific requirements that can be implemented in code. They balance security needs with practical usage, including human oversight where appropriate. The inclusion of interactive questioning and clarifying dialogue demonstrates awareness of real-world implementation challenges. The main practical challenge might be maintaining currency with changing legal standards.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group shows exceptional cohesion and coverage, with appropriate redundancy for critical areas and strong practicality. The high score reflects its comprehensive approach to legal code generation safety while maintaining implementability.",
