    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 4 specs, Avg Score: 56.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b67a7f1f21eb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD validate that legal document comparison algorithms include contextual semantic analysis rather than simple text matching to avoid missing substantive legal differences.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ac125d7b1049, Score: 76)\nMUST validate that generated court filing automation includes format compliance checking against specific court rules and electronic filing system requirements for target jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 81192e026bcf, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e94b3499a6e9, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, attorney bar numbers, and client identifiers in all generated legal code outputs.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal code generation safety. They progress logically from document analysis (Spec 1) through filing automation (Spec 2) and judicial process safeguards (Spec 3) to privacy protection (Spec 4). The requirements complement each other well, creating a comprehensive chain of safety measures without conflicts.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group addresses major risk areas in legal code generation including document comparison, court filing compliance, judicial automation limits, and privacy protection. It covers both technical accuracy (Specs 1-2) and ethical/legal boundaries (Specs 3-4). The only minor gap might be in version control or audit trail requirements for legal document modifications.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. For example, Specs 2 and 4 both touch on compliance but focus on different aspects (court rules vs. privacy). The requirements are distinct yet interconnected, providing good coverage without waste.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and specific enough for implementation. They balance security needs (privacy masking, human oversight) with practical functionality (automation of appropriate tasks). The specifications can be adapted across different jurisdictions and court systems, though some complexity exists in implementing contextual semantic analysis (Spec 1).\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThis is a well-designed policy group that effectively addresses the key risks and requirements of legal code generation while maintaining practicality and efficiency.",
