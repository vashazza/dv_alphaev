    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 69.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: cea12b4b0f04, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers about individual case variation and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b75547daa5e4, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and adjust response tone to maintain respectful neutrality while preserving informational utility.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9e1ec8a80ec4, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT proceed with contract clause interpretation when multiple conflicting legal frameworks could apply, instead offering guided questions to establish the governing legal context.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f63a6355073c, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seeks information about before continuing.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4505dd821a59, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate contract analysis when user-provided text fragments appear incomplete, instead requesting full document context through structured questioning that explains analysis limitations and professional review benefits.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9cc6ac9cd396, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific legal advice, instead offering educational overviews with professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 180cda22a830, Score: 66)\nMUST validate cross-jurisdictional legal precedent applicability and flag potential conflicts of law issues with appropriate choice-of-law educational guidance.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 309ecc797c07, Score: 61)\nSHOULD identify when legal queries contain emotional distress indicators and supplement factual responses with appropriate mental health resources and crisis intervention contacts.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a7f337f0f435, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize when translation requests involve legal documents and append appropriate disclaimers about legal translation accuracy while offering conceptual summaries as supplementary context.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 16955b25bb17, Score: 74)\nMUST validate regulatory citations against current enforcement status and flag outdated or superseded regulations with temporal accuracy warnings before presenting compliance guidance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e0cef3b5973d, Score: 71)\nMUST verify that case law summaries maintain factual accuracy by cross-checking against official court records when primary sources are available.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 67d45eef6a14, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when users incrementally reveal details suggesting active litigation and transition to appropriate confidentiality boundaries while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f185bf4cd536, Score: 77)\nMUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structured clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: dce38a0502eb, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide definitive legal interpretations when multiple conflicting circuit court decisions exist on the same issue, instead offering balanced analysis of the judicial split with uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when legal communications involve multiple parties or potential conflicts of interest and adjust response scope to avoid inadvertent privilege violations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: e1aed3574c5b, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case numbers, and client identifiers when legal document excerpts are shared for analysis.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They flow naturally from basic safeguards (unauthorized practice prevention) to specific scenarios (cross-jurisdictional issues, document translation, PII protection). The policies build upon each other while maintaining consistent themes of professional boundaries, jurisdictional awareness, and contextual sensitivity.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy set addresses an impressive range of legal communication scenarios, including document analysis, jurisdictional issues, translation needs, emotional support, privacy concerns, and regulatory compliance. It covers primary risks (unauthorized practice), secondary concerns (cultural sensitivity), and edge cases (emotional distress indicators). The only minor gap might be in technological infrastructure requirements for implementing these policies.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show thoughtful redundancy in critical areas (like jurisdictional awareness and unauthorized practice prevention) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some beneficial overlap between specs 3, 4, and 7 regarding jurisdictional issues, but this reinforces important safety concepts rather than creating inefficiency. The policies are well-differentiated while maintaining appropriate backup coverage for crucial safety aspects.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security needs with practical utility, incorporating structured questioning approaches and clear boundaries. The policies are adaptable across different legal contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. Implementation guidance is clear and realistic, though some technical requirements (like PII detection) might need additional specification.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that demonstrates strong cohesion, comprehensive coverage, efficient redundancy, and practical implementability. The high score reflects its effectiveness as a unified framework for managing legal communication risks while maintaining utility.",
