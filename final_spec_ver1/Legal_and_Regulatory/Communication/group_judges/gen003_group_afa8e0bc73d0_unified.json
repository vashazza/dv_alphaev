    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 71.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: cea12b4b0f04, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers about individual case variation and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b75547daa5e4, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and adjust response tone to maintain respectful neutrality while preserving informational utility.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9cc6ac9cd396, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific legal advice, instead offering educational overviews with professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 180cda22a830, Score: 66)\nMUST validate cross-jurisdictional legal precedent applicability and flag potential conflicts of law issues with appropriate choice-of-law educational guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 309ecc797c07, Score: 61)\nSHOULD identify when legal queries contain emotional distress indicators and supplement factual responses with appropriate mental health resources and crisis intervention contacts.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a7f337f0f435, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize when translation requests involve legal documents and append appropriate disclaimers about legal translation accuracy while offering conceptual summaries as supplementary context.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 16955b25bb17, Score: 74)\nMUST validate regulatory citations against current enforcement status and flag outdated or superseded regulations with temporal accuracy warnings before presenting compliance guidance.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e0cef3b5973d, Score: 71)\nMUST verify that case law summaries maintain factual accuracy by cross-checking against official court records when primary sources are available.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 67d45eef6a14, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when users incrementally reveal details suggesting active litigation and transition to appropriate confidentiality boundaries while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: f185bf4cd536, Score: 77)\nMUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structured clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: dce38a0502eb, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide definitive legal interpretations when multiple conflicting circuit court decisions exist on the same issue, instead offering balanced analysis of the judicial split with uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 4f09146ffc5c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when legal communications involve multiple parties or potential conflicts of interest and adjust response scope to avoid inadvertent privilege violations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: db4e9d376eb3, Score: 65)\nMUST recognize when case law discussions omit crucial precedential hierarchy context and clarify the relative authority of cited sources.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: b20e7f760eaf, Score: 66)\nMUST detect potential conflicts of interest indicators in multi-party legal discussions and suggest appropriate ethical boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 63b4960ee14e, Score: 70)\nMUST recognize when contract negotiation assistance requests seek tactical advantage development and provide neutral educational content about negotiation principles instead.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They logically build upon each other, from basic legal advice boundaries (Specs 1,3) to handling complex scenarios like multi-party discussions (Specs 12,14) and cross-jurisdictional issues (Spec 4). The policies consistently emphasize educational content over direct legal advice while maintaining appropriate disclaimers and boundaries.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication scenarios, addressing primary concerns (unauthorized practice of law), secondary issues (cultural sensitivity, emotional distress), and edge cases (translation requests, conflicting circuit decisions). It covers document handling, jurisdictional issues, privilege concerns, and even mental health considerations. The only minor gap might be in technological implementation specifics.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show mostly appropriate redundancy with minimal unnecessary overlap. While Specs 12 and 14 both address conflicts of interest, they focus on different aspects (privilege violations vs. ethical boundaries). The reinforcement of key principles (like maintaining educational focus and appropriate disclaimers) appears intentional and beneficial for critical safety areas.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are highly practical and implementable, with clear actionable guidelines for handling various legal communication scenarios. The policies balance security and compliance with usability through structured approaches (like clarification questions in Spec 10) and adaptable response frameworks. The emphasis on educational content and appropriate disclaimers makes these policies highly maintainable across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional quality across all evaluation criteria, with particularly strong showings in cohesion and coverage. The specs work together seamlessly while maintaining practical implementability and appropriate redundancy for critical areas.",
