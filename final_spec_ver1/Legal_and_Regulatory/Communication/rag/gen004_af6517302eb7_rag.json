  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They consistently emphasize professional boundaries, ethical compliance, and appropriate redirections. The specs build on each other logically - from initial validation (Spec 1) through various interaction scenarios (document handling, research, negotiations) to privacy protection (Spec 16). The policies share common themes of preventing unauthorized practice of law while promoting educational alternatives.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication scenarios, addressing document handling, research, negotiations, professional conduct, and privacy concerns. It covers both direct legal advice prevention and alternative educational approaches. The inclusion of PII protection (Spec 16) and conflict of interest detection (Spec 15) shows attention to secondary risks. The only minor gap might be in handling cross-jurisdictional scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 4 and 7 regarding legal obligation circumvention, and between Specs 10 and 12 regarding document drafting, these redundancies appear intentional and beneficial for critical areas. The majority of specs address distinct aspects of legal communication while maintaining consistent principles. The redundancy present serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than creating inefficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are highly implementable, with clear triggers and actions. They provide specific guidance for redirecting users to appropriate resources and maintaining professional boundaries. The requirements for detecting patterns, flagging issues, and providing educational alternatives are concrete and actionable. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained through the educational redirect approach rather than simple blocking."
