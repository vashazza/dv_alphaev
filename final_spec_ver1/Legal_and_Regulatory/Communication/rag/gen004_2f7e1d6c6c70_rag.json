    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They logically build upon each other, from basic jurisdiction checking (Spec 4) to handling complex scenarios like cross-jurisdictional issues (Spec 7) and document translation (Spec 9). The specs consistently emphasize professional consultation requirements and maintain appropriate boundaries around legal advice.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios, including contract analysis, jurisdictional issues, translation needs, emotional support, and privilege concerns. It addresses primary risks (unauthorized practice of law), secondary concerns (emotional distress), and edge cases (multi-party communications, conflict of interest). The inclusion of both technical and human aspects (like emotional support in Spec 8) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like maintaining professional boundaries) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some intentional overlap between Specs 1 and 6 regarding unauthorized practice of law, but this reinforces a crucial safety requirement. The specs efficiently build upon each other without excessive repetition.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific triggers for different responses. They balance security needs with usability by providing structured questioning approaches (Spec 13) and maintaining conversational momentum. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions while remaining specific enough to be actionable."
