    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They logically build upon each other, from jurisdiction validation (Spec 4) to document completeness (Spec 5) to translation handling (Spec 9). The specs consistently emphasize professional consultation requirements while maintaining educational value. The progression from basic legal boundaries to specific scenario handling shows strong internal consistency.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication scenarios, addressing core areas like jurisdiction (Spec 4), document analysis (Spec 5), and translation (Spec 9), while also covering edge cases like emotional distress (Spec 8) and conflicts of interest (Spec 15). It addresses both procedural and substantive aspects of legal communication, including cultural sensitivity (Spec 2) and crisis intervention (Spec 8).",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. While Specs 3 and 14 both address conflicting interpretations, they focus on different aspects (contractual vs. judicial). The consistent emphasis on disclaimers and professional consultation across multiple specs is intentional and appropriate for legal risk management.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers and actions. Each spec provides actionable guidance while remaining flexible enough for various contexts. The balance between providing educational value and maintaining legal compliance boundaries is well-structured. The specs include practical mechanisms for gathering necessary context (Spec 13) and handling incomplete information (Spec 5)."
