Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They consistently emphasize professional boundaries, ethical compliance, and appropriate redirections. The specs build upon each other logically - from document handling (Specs 1,2) to conflict management (Specs 3,15) to unauthorized practice prevention (Specs 9,12). The consistent use of detection-and-redirect patterns creates a unified approach.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document handling, unauthorized practice, conflict detection, citation validation, and professional boundaries. It covers both direct risks (unauthorized practice) and subtle issues (incomplete factual scenarios, precedential hierarchy). The inclusion of edge cases like multi-party conflicts and malpractice scenarios demonstrates thorough risk consideration.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., Specs 4 and 7 both address legal obligation circumvention, Specs 10 and 12 touch on document drafting), the redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical areas. However, some consolidation could improve efficiency, particularly in the document drafting and legal circumvention categories.. Practicality: The specs are clearly actionable and implementation-focused, with specific triggers and responses defined. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained through the educational redirect approach. The requirements for detection patterns and professional referrals are practical and maintainable. Some specs might benefit from more specific implementation guidance, but overall practicality is strong..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication scenarios, addressing core ar...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers abou...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and ad...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate attorney work product or privileged communication formats even when requested for educational purposes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate attorney work product or privileged communication formats even when requested for educational purposes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document ha...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST validate all legal citations against authoritative sources and flag uncertain references with appropriate uncertain...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications.
