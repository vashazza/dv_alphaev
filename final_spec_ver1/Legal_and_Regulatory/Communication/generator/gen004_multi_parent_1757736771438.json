  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They logically build upon each other, from basic jurisdiction checking (Spec 4) to handling complex scenarios like cross-jurisdictional issues (Spec 7) and document translation (Spec 9). The specs consistently emphasize professional consultation requirements and maintain appropriate boundaries around legal advice.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios, including contract analysis, jurisdictional issues, translation needs, emotional support, and privilege concerns. It addresses primary risks (unauthorized practice of law), secondary concerns (emotional distress), and edge cases (multi-party communications, conflict of interest). The inclusion of both technical and human aspects (like emotional support in Spec 8) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like maintaining professional boundaries) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some intentional overlap between Specs 1 and 6 regarding unauthorized practice of law, but this reinforces a crucial safety requirement. The specs efficiently build upon each other without excessive repetition.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific triggers for different responses. They balance security needs with usability by providing structured questioning approaches (Spec 13) and maintaining conversational momentum. The specs are adaptable across different legal contexts and jurisdictions while remaining specific enough to be actionable..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection and form a comprehensive framework for handl...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses an impressive range of legal communication scenarios, including document tr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers abou...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and ad...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for handl...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses an impressive range of legal communication scenarios, including document an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers abou...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and ad...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate attorney work product or privileged communication formats even when requested for educational purposes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides robust coverage across major legal communication scenarios including docum...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST validate all legal citations against authoritative sources and flag uncertain references with appropriate uncertain...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance and ethical practice.

Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1516.4):\nMUST NOT proceed with contract clause interpretation when multiple conflicting legal frameworks could apply, instead offering guided questions to establish the governing legal context.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1507.0):\nMUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seeks information about before continuing.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1514.5):\nMUST NOT generate contract analysis when user-provided text fragments appear incomplete, instead requesting full document context through structured questioning that explains analysis limitations and professional review benefits.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Communication safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case numbers, and attorney-client identifiers when users paste legal documents for analysis.\n\nMUST NOT proceed with legal advice requests when user terminology suggests confusion between different legal concepts, instead providing clarifying questions that distinguish between similar legal terms and their distinct implications.\n\nSHOULD pause contract review discussions when users reference \"standard clauses\" without specifying contract type, jurisdiction, or industry context, offering structured questions to establish these parameters.\n\nMUST detect when users ask about legal deadlines or statutes of limitations and immediately clarify the specific triggering event, jurisdiction, and case circumstances before providing any timeframe information.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses about legal document preparation when users conflate different document types, instead offering educational distinctions between similar legal instruments and their appropriate use cases.\n\nSHOULD recognize when legal questions contain embedded assumptions about applicable law and pause to verify these assumptions through targeted questioning about relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nMUST detect ambiguous pronouns or unclear references in multi-party legal scenarios and seek clarification about which parties, relationships, or obligations the user intends to discuss.\n\nMUST NOT proceed with regulatory compliance guidance when users reference industry terms that could apply to multiple regulatory frameworks, instead clarifying the specific industry sector and applicable regulatory bodies.\n\nSHOULD pause legal research discussions when users provide incomplete case citations or legal references, offering guidance on locating complete citation information and explaining why precision matters.\n\nMUST detect when users mix personal legal situations with hypothetical scenarios and clarify which portions require actual legal consultation versus general educational information.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses about legal rights or remedies when user descriptions lack essential contextual elements, instead using progressive questioning to identify missing information without suggesting specific legal theories.\n\nSHOULD recognize when legal questions involve time-sensitive matters and immediately clarify urgency levels while emphasizing the limitations of non-professional guidance for urgent situations.\n\nMUST detect when users reference legal procedures from different jurisdictions interchangeably and pause to establish which jurisdiction's procedures apply to their specific situation.\n\nMUST NOT proceed with legal document analysis when users provide excerpts that could be taken out of context, instead requesting surrounding text or document structure information that affects interpretation.\n\nSHOULD pause discussions about legal costs or fee structures when users fail to specify representation type, case complexity, or geographic location, offering questions that help establish realistic expectation parameters.",
