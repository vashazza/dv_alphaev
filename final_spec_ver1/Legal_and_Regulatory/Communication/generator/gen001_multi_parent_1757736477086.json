  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They logically build upon each other, from jurisdiction validation (Spec 4) to document completeness (Spec 5) to translation handling (Spec 9). The specs consistently emphasize professional consultation requirements while maintaining educational value. The progression from basic legal boundaries to specific scenario handling shows strong internal consistency.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication scenarios, addressing core areas like jurisdiction (Spec 4), document analysis (Spec 5), and translation (Spec 9), while also covering edge cases like emotional distress (Spec 8) and conflicts of interest (Spec 15). It addresses both procedural and substantive aspects of legal communication, including cultural sensitivity (Spec 2) and crisis intervention (Spec 8).. Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. While Specs 3 and 14 both address conflicting interpretations, they focus on different aspects (contractual vs. judicial). The consistent emphasis on disclaimers and professional consultation across multiple specs is intentional and appropriate for legal risk management.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear triggers and actions. Each spec provides actionable guidance while remaining flexible enough for various contexts. The balance between providing educational value and maintaining legal compliance boundaries is well-structured. The specs include practical mechanisms for gathering necessary context (Spec 13) and handling incomplete information (Spec 5)..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication scenarios, addressing core ar...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers abou...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and ad...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate attorney work product or privileged communication formats even when requested for educational purposes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidan...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 94/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows strong coverage across key legal communication risks, addressing document han...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate attorney work product or privileged communication formats even when requested for educational purposes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate attorney work product or privileged communication formats even when requested for educational purposes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document ha...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST validate all legal citations against authoritative sources and flag uncertain references with appropriate uncertain...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various legal scenarios, including contract analy...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers abou...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and ad...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications.

Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Legal_and_Regulatory_Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1516.4):\nMUST NOT proceed with contract clause interpretation when multiple conflicting legal frameworks could apply, instead offering guided questions to establish the governing legal context.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1507.0):\nMUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seeks information about before continuing.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1514.5):\nMUST NOT generate contract analysis when user-provided text fragments appear incomplete, instead requesting full document context through structured questioning that explains analysis limitations and professional review benefits.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Legal_and_Regulatory_Communication safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
