Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal communications. They consistently emphasize professional boundaries, ethical compliance, and appropriate redirections. The specs build on each other logically - from initial validation (Spec 1) through various interaction scenarios (document handling, research, negotiations) to privacy protection (Spec 16). The policies share common themes of preventing unauthorized practice of law while promoting educational alternatives.. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication scenarios, addressing document handling, research, negotiations, professional conduct, and privacy concerns. It covers both direct legal advice prevention and alternative educational approaches. The inclusion of PII protection (Spec 16) and conflict of interest detection (Spec 15) shows attention to secondary risks. The only minor gap might be in handling cross-jurisdictional scenarios.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between Specs 4 and 7 regarding legal obligation circumvention, and between Specs 10 and 12 regarding document drafting, these redundancies appear intentional and beneficial for critical areas. The majority of specs address distinct aspects of legal communication while maintaining consistent principles. The redundancy present serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than creating inefficiency.. Practicality: The specs are highly implementable, with clear triggers and actions. They provide specific guidance for redirecting users to appropriate resources and maintaining professional boundaries. The requirements for detecting patterns, flagging issues, and providing educational alternatives are concrete and actionable. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained through the educational redirect approach rather than simple blocking..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection and form a comprehensive framework for handl...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses an impressive range of legal communication scenarios, including document tr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers abou...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and ad...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for handl...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses an impressive range of legal communication scenarios, including document an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses suggesting specific legal remedies or causes of action without comprehensive disclaimers abou...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and ad...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across legal communication risks, addressing document...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate attorney work product or privileged communication formats even when requested for educational purposes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses to compliance questions when industry-specific regulatory bodies maintain conflicting guidan...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling legal commu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides robust coverage across major legal communication scenarios including docum...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST validate all legal citations against authoritative sources and flag uncertain references with appropriate uncertain...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on legal compliance and ethical practice.
