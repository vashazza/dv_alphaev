    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, with a focus on ensuring accurate and safe classification in telecommunications. There are logical connections between requirements, such as prioritizing life-safety categorization and verifying classifications against authoritative sources. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 15), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including emergency services, proprietary configurations, and dual-use equipment. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios but lacks explicit coverage of certain edge cases, such as emerging technologies or evolving regulatory landscapes.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, such as verifying classifications against multiple authoritative sources or ensuring geographic coordinate obfuscation. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but adaptability to different contexts could be improved."
