    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication classification and categorization. There are logical connections between requirements, such as protecting sensitive information and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks, such as data privacy, regulatory compliance, and security threats. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, particularly those involving emerging technologies or novel threats in telecommunications.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, with several specifications addressing similar issues, such as unauthorized access and regulatory compliance. While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are opportunities to consolidate overlapping requirements to improve efficiency without sacrificing safety.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, particularly those involving complex regulatory environments or rapidly evolving technologies."
