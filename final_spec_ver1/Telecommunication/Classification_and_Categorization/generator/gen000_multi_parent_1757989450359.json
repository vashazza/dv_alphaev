Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of classification and categorization in telecommunications. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on protecting sensitive information and ensuring classification accuracy. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical compliance areas like user privacy, network security, and operational security. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit guidelines for emerging technologies or evolving threat landscapes..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on protecting sensitive information and ensuring classification accuracy. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical compliance areas like user privacy, network security, and operational security. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit guidelines for emerging technologies or evolving threat landscapes.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, and 13; SPEC 15 and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the telecommunications domain. However, some specs could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance real-world applicability and maintainability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 54) SHOULD recognize edge cases where network equipment specifications could enable unauthorized access ...\n  - [2] (Score: 63) SHOULD initiate dialogue to clarify technical scope when users request broad categorization of \"5G s...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) SHOULD NOT categorize critical infrastructure components including emergency broadcast systems, publ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
