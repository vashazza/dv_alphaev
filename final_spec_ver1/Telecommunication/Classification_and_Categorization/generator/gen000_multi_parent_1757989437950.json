Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, with a focus on ensuring accurate and safe classification in telecommunications. There are logical connections between requirements, such as prioritizing life-safety categorization and verifying classifications against authoritative sources. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 15) that could have been consolidated to improve cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including emergency services, proprietary configurations, and dual-use equipment. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively, but there are potential gaps in addressing edge cases comprehensively, such as specific regional regulatory differences or emerging technologies..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as prioritizing life-safety categorization and verifying classifications against authoritative sources. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 15) that could have been consolidated to improve cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including emergency services, proprietary configurations, and dual-use equipment. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively, but there are potential gaps in addressing edge cases comprehensively, such as specific regional regulatory differences or emerging technologies.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple entries addressing similar issues (e.g., emergency services protocols and edge cases). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems more like duplication rather than intentional reinforcement, indicating room for consolidation.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation, such as verifying against standards and requesting additional parameters for clarity. However, the presence of repeated specifications and some potentially vague requirements (e.g., \"broad categorization\") could hinder maintainability and adaptability in real-world scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 54) SHOULD recognize edge cases where network equipment specifications could enable unauthorized access ...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) SHOULD NOT categorize critical infrastructure components including emergency broadcast systems, publ...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) SHOULD detect when classification confidence falls below 85% for critical infrastructure categories ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
