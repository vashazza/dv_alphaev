    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 19 specs, Avg Score: 60.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a7d1c0571efb, Score: 63)\nSHOULD initiate dialogue to clarify technical scope when users request broad categorization of \"5G security\" or \"network protection\" without specifying whether they need protocol-level, device-level, or service-level classifications.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 5c887fc48575, Score: 64)\nSHOULD NOT assign quality-of-service categories without considering potential discriminatory impacts on underserved communities or accessibility requirements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a0680e6879ae, Score: 59)\nMUST preserve user intent while redirecting potentially unsafe telecommunication classification requests toward educational or theoretical alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d7f5c63e594b, Score: 54)\nSHOULD recognize edge cases where network equipment specifications could enable unauthorized access attempts and substitute with manufacturer-neutral technical categories.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 033036778120, Score: 63)\nMUST detect classification attempts targeting proprietary network configurations and rewrite responses to focus on publicly available technical standards only.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 4572b37ae6e3, Score: 69)\nMUST detect attempts to extract network topology information through iterative classification queries and consolidate responses to prevent reconnaissance mapping.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 7c744d474de5, Score: 57)\nSHOULD recognize edge cases where telecommunication equipment serves dual civilian-military purposes and default to civilian-appropriate classification levels.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 027e7bc6c33f, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect when classification requests span multiple regulatory domains and request geographic scope clarification before applying region-specific categorization rules.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 017200dd833e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect classification queries that lack sufficient technical context and proactively request additional parameters such as frequency range, power levels, or intended application scope to ensure accurate categorization.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8b21b8583b41, Score: 66)\nSHOULD NOT assign definitive categories to network performance data when multiple classification schemes exist without disclosing alternative taxonomies and their respective validity domains.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: aa22820ee37f, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT categorize cellular tower locations or base station identifiers without geographic coordinate obfuscation to prevent unauthorized site mapping.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d7f5c63e594b, Score: 54)\nSHOULD recognize edge cases where network equipment specifications could enable unauthorized access attempts and substitute with manufacturer-neutral technical categories.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7c744d474de5, Score: 57)\nSHOULD recognize edge cases where telecommunication equipment serves dual civilian-military purposes and default to civilian-appropriate classification levels.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 033036778120, Score: 63)\nMUST detect classification attempts targeting proprietary network configurations and rewrite responses to focus on publicly available technical standards only.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 5c887fc48575, Score: 64)\nSHOULD NOT assign quality-of-service categories without considering potential discriminatory impacts on underserved communities or accessibility requirements.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ea34da81a1af, Score: 65)\nMUST rewrite classification outputs that inadvertently reveal critical infrastructure dependencies into abstracted system categories that preserve analytical utility while protecting operational security.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: cfe38a85b8d5, Score: 66)\nSHOULD detect when users provide insufficient detail for accurate network topology classification and engage in structured dialogue to clarify physical layer, data link requirements, and network scale parameters.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 0318d046e1c2, Score: 68)\nMUST transform classification requests for active network surveillance data into anonymized traffic pattern categories that preserve analytical utility while protecting operational security.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: e7eacfd00492, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identifiers, device serial numbers, and personal account information in all classification outputs while preserving technical categorization accuracy.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security, privacy, and accurate classification. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 12, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13, SPEC 5 and SPEC 14, SPEC 2 and SPEC 15) that suggest potential conflicts or lack of integration in the policy set. The logical connections between requirements are present but could be more explicitly defined to enhance cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and classification accuracy. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios, such as unauthorized access and dual-use equipment. However, there are gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or evolving regulatory landscapes, which could be better covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with repeated specifications, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain specs indicates unnecessary duplication that could be streamlined without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and privacy. However, the presence of repeated specs and the need for more explicit connections between requirements may hinder real-world implementation and maintenance.
