    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific

Score: 63)\nSHOULD initiate dialogue to clarify technical scope when users request broad categorization of \"5G security\" or \"network protection\" without specifying whether they need protocol-level, device-level, or service-level classifications.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 5c887fc48575, Score: 64)\nSHOULD NOT assign quality-of-service categories without considering potential discriminatory impacts on underserved communities or accessibility requirements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a0680e6879ae, Score: 59)\nMUST preserve user intent while redirecting potentially unsafe telecommunication classification requests toward educational or theoretical alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 51b5bf768fc6, Score: N/A)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous telecommunications terminology requests and initiate targeted clarification dialogue by presenting 3-5 specific technical subcategories with contextual definitions rather than providing broad generalizations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 033036778120, Score: 63)\nMUST detect classification attempts targeting proprietary network configurations and rewrite responses to focus on publicly available technical standards only.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 4572b37ae6e3, Score: 69)\nMUST detect attempts to extract network topology information through iterative classification queries and consolidate responses to prevent reconnaissance mapping.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 7c744d474de5, Score: 57)\nSHOULD recognize edge cases where telecommunication equipment serves dual civilian-military purposes and default to civilian-appropriate classification levels.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 027e7bc6c33f, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect when classification requests span multiple regulatory domains and request geographic scope clarification before applying region-specific categorization rules.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 017200dd833e, Score: 70)\nMUST detect classification queries that lack sufficient technical context and proactively request additional parameters such as frequency range, power levels, or intended application scope to ensure accurate categorization.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8b21b8583b41, Score: 66)\nSHOULD NOT assign definitive categories to network performance data when multiple classification schemes exist without disclosing alternative taxonomies and their respective validity domains.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: aa22820ee37f, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT categorize cellular tower locations or base station identifiers without geographic coordinate obfuscation to prevent unauthorized site mapping.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 51b5bf768fc6, Score: N/A)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous telecommunications terminology requests and initiate targeted clarification dialogue by presenting 3-5 specific technical subcategories with contextual definitions rather than providing broad generalizations.\n\n[SPEC

standards only.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2c3a271022e3, Score: N/A)\nSHOULD initiate clarification dialogue when users request classification of network components using ambiguous terminology like \"critical systems\" or \"secure infrastructure\" by asking for specific equipment models, deployment contexts, and regulatory frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 2c3a271022e3, Score: N/A)\nSHOULD initiate clarification dialogue when users request classification of network components using ambiguous terminology like \"critical systems\" or \"secure infrastructure\" by asking for specific equipment models, deployment contexts, and regulatory frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 7c744d474de5, Score: 57)\nSHOULD recognize edge cases where telecommunication equipment serves dual civilian-military purposes

classification requests toward educational or theoretical alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 0dbf39417628, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identifiers, device serial numbers, and account credentials when categorizing telecommunication equipment or service records.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specs generally aim to create a cohesive framework by addressing various aspects of telecommunication classification and categorization. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 4, 12 and SPEC 13, 17, 18) that suggest a lack of integration and coordination. The specs do complement each other in terms of addressing different facets of classification, but the repetition indicates potential conflicts or oversight in ensuring a unified strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including technical scope clarification, discrimination prevention, proprietary information protection, and geographic considerations. However, there are gaps in addressing emerging technologies and evolving regulatory landscapes, which are critical in the fast-paced telecommunication domain.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=12  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specs, with multiple instances of identical or very similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 4, 12 and SPEC 13, 17, 18). This indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be streamlined to reduce unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like initiating dialogue for clarification and protecting sensitive information. However, the presence of repeated specs and the lack of adaptability to rapidly changing contexts in telecommunications reduce the overall practicality and maintainability of the policy set.\n\nTOTAL=64",
