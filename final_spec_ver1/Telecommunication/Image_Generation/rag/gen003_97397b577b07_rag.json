    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security and compliance in telecommunication image generation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 5) that could be consolidated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the presence of duplicates suggests a need for better integration.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and compliance with industry standards. Primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, such as PII masking and avoiding depictions of vulnerabilities. However, there may be gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common attack vectors.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of identical or very similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 9). While some redundancy can enhance robustness, the level observed here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could streamline the policy set without losing critical safety measures.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on security. However, the presence of repeated specifications and the potential for gaps in edge-case coverage may pose challenges in implementation and maintenance. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but the policy set could benefit from more adaptability to different contexts."
