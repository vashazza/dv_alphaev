    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security and privacy in telecommunication image generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as PII masking, avoiding depictions of vulnerabilities, and redirecting potentially harmful requests. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, including PII protection, infrastructure security, and misinformation prevention. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging threats or less common vulnerabilities.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., PII masking and mobile device cloning). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing clear directives on what must or must not be done. However, the presence of repeated specifications could complicate maintenance and implementation, slightly reducing practicality."
