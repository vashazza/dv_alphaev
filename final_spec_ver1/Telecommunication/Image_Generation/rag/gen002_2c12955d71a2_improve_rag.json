    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring security and compliance in telecommunication image generation. They collectively address the transformation of sensitive requests into safer alternatives, the masking of PII, and the prevention of generating content that could compromise security. However, there are some repeated specifications which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of sensitive information, prevention of security breaches, and adherence to safety standards. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in the telecommunication domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., PII masking and mobile device cloning prevention). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, although some specifications could benefit from clearer guidelines on implementation. The adaptability to different contexts is present but could be enhanced with more specific examples or scenarios."
