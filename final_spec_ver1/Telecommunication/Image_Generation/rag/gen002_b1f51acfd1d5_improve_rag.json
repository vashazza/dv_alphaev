    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at protecting sensitive telecommunication information. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as masking PII, preventing unauthorized surveillance, and promoting security awareness. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated with telecommunication image generation. It addresses vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and the need for educational content. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common attack vectors, which could be further explored.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are several overlapping specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 9 and SPEC 14) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The redundancy in critical areas is appropriate, but the repetition of similar requirements suggests room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts due to the complexity of detecting and transforming specific prompts."
