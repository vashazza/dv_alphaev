    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at safeguarding sensitive telecommunication information. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as masking PII, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring educational content is safe. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 12) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated with telecommunication image generation. It addresses key areas like network topology, spectrum usage, and PII protection. However, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple entries addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 12, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts within the telecommunication domain. However, some specifications could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance real-world applicability."
