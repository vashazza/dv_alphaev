Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at protecting sensitive telecommunication information. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of security, such as preventing the depiction of sensitive infrastructure and ensuring the sanitization of potentially harmful content. However, there are minor overlaps in the objectives of some specs that could be streamlined for better cohesion..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of security, such as preventing the depiction of sensitive infrastructure and ensuring the sanitization of potentially harmful content. However, there are minor overlaps in the objectives of some specs that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, including primary and secondary scenarios like infrastructure security and data privacy. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common security threats, which could be further explored.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some necessary redundancy to ensure critical areas are covered, there are instances of overlapping requirements, particularly in specs dealing with network topology and sensitive information. Consolidating these could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently due to the complexity of determining what constitutes sensitive information in diverse scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 59) SHOULD recognize when image prompts blend legitimate educational needs with potentially harmful tech...\n  - [2] (Score: 63) MUST apply safe-rewrite techniques to transform potentially sensitive network infrastructure request...\n  - [3] (Score: 70) MUST filter prompts requesting images of specific telecommunication facility layouts and offer gener...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
