  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 16-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at protecting sensitive telecommunication information. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as masking PII, preventing unauthorized surveillance, and promoting security awareness. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated with telecommunication image generation. It addresses vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and the need for educational content. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common attack vectors, which could be further explored.. Target Spec: RECOMMENDED to detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary telecommunication design... Focus on enhancing this spec while maintaining group cohesion.\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at protec...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at safegu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at safeguarding ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of classified informati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and compliance with indust...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect and transform requests for images showing physical network infrastructure vulnerabilities into hardening bes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST validate that telecommunication equipment visualizations reflect current industry safety standards and do not depic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks related to...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of sensitive informatio...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST transform prompts requesting classified military communication systems into civilian-equivalent educational represe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, a...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at protecting sensitive telecommunication information. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as masking PII, preventing unauthorized surveillance, and promoting security awareness. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated with telecommunication image generation. It addresses vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and the need for educational content. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common attack vectors, which could be further explored.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are several overlapping specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 9 and SPEC 14) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The redundancy in critical areas is appropriate, but the repetition of similar requirements suggests room for streamlining.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts due to the complexity of detecting and transforming specific prompts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) RECOMMENDED to detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary telecommunication design...\n  - [2] (Score: 70) MUST filter prompts requesting images of specific telecommunication facility layouts and offer gener...\n  - [3] (Score: 59) SHOULD recognize when image prompts blend legitimate educational needs with potentially harmful tech...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
