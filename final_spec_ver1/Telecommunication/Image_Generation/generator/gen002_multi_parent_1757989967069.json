Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring security and compliance in telecommunication image generation. They collectively address the transformation of sensitive requests into safer alternatives, the masking of PII, and the prevention of generating content that could compromise security. However, there are some repeated specifications which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of sensitive information, prevention of security breaches, and adherence to safety standards. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in the telecommunication domain..

They collectively address the transformation of sensitive requests into safer alternatives, the masking of PII, and the prevention of generating content that could compromise security. However, there are some repeated specifications which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of sensitive information, prevention of security breaches, and adherence to safety standards. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in the telecommunication domain.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., PII masking and mobile device cloning prevention). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, although some specifications could benefit from clearer guidelines on implementation. The adaptability to different contexts is present but could be enhanced with more specific examples or scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 76) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentica...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentica...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST transform requests for images showing telecommunication service theft methodologies into servic...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.

(Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect ambiguous telecommunication terminology in image requests and initiate clarification dialogue to distinguish between consumer equipment, enterprise infrastructure, or carrier-grade systems before generating visual content.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1511.0):\nMUST NOT generate visual content depicting actual emergency communication system vulnerabilities, critical infrastructure weak points, or disaster recovery bypass methods that could compromise public safety networks.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 77/100, Elo: 1597.3):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, and personal contact information in telecommunication infrastructure visualizations before content generation.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Image Generation safety mechanisms within Telecommunication domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
