  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security and compliance in telecommunication image generation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 5) that could be consolidated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the presence of duplicates suggests a need for better integration.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and compliance with industry standards. Primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, such as PII masking and avoiding depictions of vulnerabilities. However, there may be gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common attack vectors.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of identical or very similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 9). While some redundancy can enhance robustness, the level observed here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating these could streamline the policy set without losing critical safety measures.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on security. However, the presence of repeated specifications and the potential for gaps in edge-case coverage may pose challenges in implementation and maintenance. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but the policy set could benefit from more adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at safeguarding ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of classified informati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): SHOULD convert requests for visual depictions of telecommunication system intrusion methods into educational diagrams sh...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at safegu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks related to teleco...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of sensitive informatio...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST transform prompts requesting classified military communication systems into civilian-equivalent educational represe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks related to teleco...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST verify that wireless spectrum visualizations exclude precise frequency allocations, power levels, or interference p...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like unauthorized...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security and compliance in telecommunication image generation.
