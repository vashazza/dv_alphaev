  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security and privacy in telecommunication image generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as PII masking, avoiding depictions of vulnerabilities, and redirecting potentially harmful requests. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, including PII protection, infrastructure security, and misinformation prevention. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging threats or less common vulnerabilities.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., PII masking and mobile device cloning). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing clear directives on what must or must not be done. However, the presence of repeated specifications could complicate maintenance and implementation, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at safeguarding ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of classified informati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): SHOULD convert requests for visual depictions of telecommunication system intrusion methods into educational diagrams sh...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at safegu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks related to teleco...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of sensitive informatio...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST transform prompts requesting classified military communication systems into civilian-equivalent educational represe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks related to teleco...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST verify that wireless spectrum visualizations exclude precise frequency allocations, power levels, or interference p...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like unauthorized...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security and privacy in telecommunication image generation.
