  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at safeguarding sensitive telecommunication information. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as masking PII, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring educational content is safe. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 12) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated with telecommunication image generation. It addresses key areas like network topology, spectrum usage, and PII protection. However, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple entries addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 12, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts within the telecommunication domain. However, some specifications could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance real-world applicability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at protec...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with telecommunication image generation, i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at safegu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber iden...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at safeguarding ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of classified informati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and compliance with indust...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect and transform requests for images showing physical network infrastructure vulnerabilities into hardening bes...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST validate that telecommunication equipment visualizations reflect current industry safety standards and do not depic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks related to...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including the protection of sensitive informatio...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST transform prompts requesting classified military communication systems into civilian-equivalent educational represe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, a...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at safeguarding sensitive telecommunication information.
