    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 72.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: da05d46e31b6, Score: 74)\nMUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward publicly available reference materials with appropriate security boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7878974b51db, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber identity spoofing techniques regardless of claimed research purposes.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 72b0af3dd910, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that wireless spectrum visualizations exclude precise frequency allocations, power levels, or interference patterns that could enable unauthorized transmission activities.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 212641f37fd3, Score: 71)\nMUST filter prompts requesting visual depictions of specific carrier network topologies and redirect to standardized reference architectures that demonstrate concepts without revealing operational details.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: eb274cf9f9ed, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate visual content depicting specific fiber optic cable routing, undersea cable landing coordinates, or critical communication infrastructure locations that could facilitate physical attacks.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d6b7eb1d7a2f, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, and personal contact information in telecommunication infrastructure visualizations before content generation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fa78213b91d0, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT create visual representations of classified network topologies, proprietary switching configurations, or security-sensitive equipment layouts without sanitizing identifying details.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 75e1fc1654ba, Score: 68)\nMUST detect prompt attempts seeking generation of images containing actual frequency allocation charts, spectrum licensing data, or regulatory compliance documentation and substitute with generalized educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 6667ac196842, Score: 75)\nSHOULD convert requests for visual depictions of telecommunication system intrusion methods into educational diagrams showing defensive countermeasures and security best practices instead.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 87c1dc51bd64, Score: 70)\nMUST filter and rewrite requests for images depicting unauthorized spectrum usage or signal jamming equipment into educational content about proper frequency allocation and interference mitigation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ef5ee87753d9, Score: 71)\nMUST ensure generated protocol diagrams exclude sensitive timing parameters, encryption key structures, or authentication bypass mechanisms that could enable unauthorized access.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f1e4873276d1, Score: 66)\nRECOMMENDED to detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary telecommunication designs and redirect toward open-standard educational alternatives that maintain learning objectives.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: d6b7eb1d7a2f, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device identifiers, authentication certificates, and personal contact information in telecommunication infrastructure visualizations before content generation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 7878974b51db, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT create images depicting methods for cloning mobile devices, SIM card duplication procedures, or subscriber identity spoofing techniques regardless of claimed research purposes.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: eb274cf9f9ed, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate visual content depicting specific fiber optic cable routing, undersea cable landing coordinates, or critical communication infrastructure locations that could facilitate physical attacks.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 6667ac196842, Score: 75)\nSHOULD convert requests for visual depictions of telecommunication system intrusion methods into educational diagrams showing defensive countermeasures and security best practices instead.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at safeguarding sensitive telecommunication information. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of security, such as preventing unauthorized access, protecting PII, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, there are some overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated with telecommunication image generation. It addresses critical areas such as infrastructure security, PII protection, and unauthorized access prevention. However, there may be some edge cases or emerging threats that are not fully addressed, leaving minor gaps in coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with some requirements being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 13, SPEC 2 and SPEC 14, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15, SPEC 9 and SPEC 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level observed here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and educational content where direct generation is restricted. However, the presence of redundant specifications could complicate maintenance and implementation, slightly reducing practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
