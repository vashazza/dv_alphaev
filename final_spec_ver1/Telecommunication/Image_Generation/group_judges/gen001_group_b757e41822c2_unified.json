    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 14 specs, Avg Score: 67.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: da05d46e31b6, Score: 74)\nMUST detect prompts attempting to recreate classified or restricted telecommunication infrastructure and redirect toward publicly available reference materials with appropriate security boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 72b0af3dd910, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that wireless spectrum visualizations exclude precise frequency allocations, power levels, or interference patterns that could enable unauthorized transmission activities.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 212641f37fd3, Score: 71)\nMUST filter prompts requesting visual depictions of specific carrier network topologies and redirect to standardized reference architectures that demonstrate concepts without revealing operational details.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fa78213b91d0, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT create visual representations of classified network topologies, proprietary switching configurations, or security-sensitive equipment layouts without sanitizing identifying details.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 75e1fc1654ba, Score: 68)\nMUST detect prompt attempts seeking generation of images containing actual frequency allocation charts, spectrum licensing data, or regulatory compliance documentation and substitute with generalized educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 6667ac196842, Score: 75)\nSHOULD convert requests for visual depictions of telecommunication system intrusion methods into educational diagrams showing defensive countermeasures and security best practices instead.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 87c1dc51bd64, Score: 70)\nMUST filter and rewrite requests for images depicting unauthorized spectrum usage or signal jamming equipment into educational content about proper frequency allocation and interference mitigation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ef5ee87753d9, Score: 71)\nMUST ensure generated protocol diagrams exclude sensitive timing parameters, encryption key structures, or authentication bypass mechanisms that could enable unauthorized access.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f1e4873276d1, Score: 66)\nRECOMMENDED to detect adversarial prompts attempting to extract proprietary telecommunication designs and redirect toward open-standard educational alternatives that maintain learning objectives.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 6667ac196842, Score: 75)\nSHOULD convert requests for visual depictions of telecommunication system intrusion methods into educational diagrams showing defensive countermeasures and security best practices instead.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 58966f975409, Score: 59)\nSHOULD recognize when image prompts blend legitimate educational needs with potentially harmful technical details and extract safe educational components while filtering sensitive elements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 58966f975409, Score: 59)\nSHOULD recognize when image prompts blend legitimate educational needs with potentially harmful technical details and extract safe educational components while filtering sensitive elements.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8b33090aef28, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes about technology access or digital divides across different communities.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 8b33090aef28, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify culturally inappropriate visual metaphors in telecommunication imagery that could perpetuate stereotypes about technology access or digital divides across different communities.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
