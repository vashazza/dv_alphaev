    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for safety and compliance in telecommunications code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy, security, and resource management. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 16), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, security, and operational integrity. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as specific emerging technologies or niche applications within telecommunications.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 14, SPEC 11 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within telecommunications. However, the presence of repeated specs might complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality."
