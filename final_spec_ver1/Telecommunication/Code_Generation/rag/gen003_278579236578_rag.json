    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhancing security and compliance in telecommunications code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy preservation, security validation, and resource management. However, some specs appear to overlap without clear differentiation, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like privacy breaches, denial of service, and unauthorized access. It also addresses secondary concerns such as resource management and compliance with licensing requirements. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common attack vectors.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 16, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts. The presence of repeated specs suggests potential maintenance challenges."
