    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring privacy, security, and ethical considerations in code generation for telecommunications. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy-preserving analytics and anonymization, and the prevention of malicious code generation. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, security, and ethical concerns in telecommunications code generation. Primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, such as DDoS prevention and network synchronization security. However, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in the rapidly evolving telecommunications landscape.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 3 and SPEC 5, SPEC 7 and SPEC 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as requiring user confirmation for sensitive operations and ensuring compliance with current cryptographic standards. However, some specs could be more detailed in terms of implementation guidance, and there is a need to balance security with usability more explicitly."
