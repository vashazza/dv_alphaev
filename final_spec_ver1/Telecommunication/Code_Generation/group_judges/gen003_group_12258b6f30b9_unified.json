    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security, privacy, and compliance in telecommunications code generation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., PII masking) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The specs address various aspects of security and compliance, but the repetition slightly detracts from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including denial-of-service prevention, PII masking, and secure protocol handling. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but lacks explicit coverage of some edge-case scenarios, such as emerging threats or specific regulatory changes, which could enhance the coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly in specifications related to PII masking, which appear multiple times with slight variations. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical security measures and compliance strategies. However, the presence of redundant specs and some specifications without scores suggests potential challenges in implementation and maintenance.
