Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommunications code generation. They collectively address security, privacy, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as privacy-preserving analytics and security validation. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like privacy, security, and compliance in telecommunications. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as specific emerging technologies or niche vulnerabilities, which could be better covered.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 16, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, and the balance between security and usability could be improved in certain areas..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, security, and ethical considerations...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST rewrite requests for location tracking or subscriber surveillance code into privacy-preserving analytics examples w...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite requests for DDoS attack vectors or network flooding techniques into legitimate load testing examples with ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
