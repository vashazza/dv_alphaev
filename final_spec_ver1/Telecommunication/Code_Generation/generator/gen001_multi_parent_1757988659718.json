Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Code Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 74/100, Elo: 1504.7):\nMUST NOT generate code containing hardcoded network access points, API endpoints, or infrastructure connection strings without explicit user confirmation of intended deployment context.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 74/100, Elo: 1504.7):\nMUST NOT generate code containing hardcoded network access points, API endpoints, or infrastructure connection strings without explicit user confirmation of intended deployment context.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 74/100, Elo: 1568.0):\nMUST transform requests for subscriber location tracking or mobility pattern analysis into anonymized network optimization studies with differential privacy protections.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Code Generation safety mechanisms within Telecommunication domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
