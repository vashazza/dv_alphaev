Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunication code generation. They cover various aspects of security, compliance, and best practices, such as cryptographic standards, input validation, and PII masking. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 5, SPEC 13 and SPEC 10), which could indicate a lack of coordination in the policy set.. Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of scenarios, including network security, protocol handling, and regulatory compliance. It covers primary and secondary risks effectively, but there might be some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging threats or niche telecommunication technologies.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with some specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 5, SPEC 13 and SPEC 10, SPEC 17 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not seem intentional for robustness and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as sanitizing code and ensuring compliance with cryptographic standards. However, the presence of repeated specs suggests potential challenges in maintaining the policy set, and some requirements might be overly prescriptive, limiting adaptability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, security, and ethical concerns in te...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST rewrite requests for location tracking or subscriber surveillance code into privacy-preserving analytics examples w...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST sanitize generated code examples by replacing actual network topology references with anonymized placeholder values...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommuni...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like signal jammi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for signal jamming or interference generation code and redirect toward legitimate signal analysis a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST verify that generated network authentication code uses current cryptographic standards and avoids deprecated securi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases.
