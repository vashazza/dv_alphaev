Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy, security, and network integrity. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 12) that slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas such as privacy, security, and network stability.

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy, security, and network integrity. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 12) that slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas such as privacy, security, and network stability. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and edge-case scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with duplicate entries (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 2 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the telecommunication domain. However, some specs could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance real-world applicability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 67) MUST validate that generated cellular handoff algorithms include boundary condition checks and preve...\n  - [2] (Score: 72) MUST validate that generated protocol handling code includes proper bounds checking and input saniti...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST validate that generated network protocol handlers include proper input validation and bounds ch...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
