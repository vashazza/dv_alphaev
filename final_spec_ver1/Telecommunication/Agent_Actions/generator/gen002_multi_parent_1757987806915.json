  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as validating actions against standards and ensuring data protection. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like data protection, network security, and regulatory compliance. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging technologies or less common threats in the telecommunication domain.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap in specifications related to security and compliance, it is generally appropriate for ensuring robustness. However, a few specs could be consolidated to reduce redundancy without compromising safety, particularly those addressing similar security threats.. Practicality: The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunication environments due to varying infrastructure and regulatory landscapes..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic refe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide specific signal jamming techniques or interference generation methods, instead offering guidance on leg...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like unaut...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic refe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT provide SIM card programming instructions or USIM personalization data that could enable unauthorized subscribe...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, network security, regulatory...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST verify fiber optic network design specifications against industry safety standards and flag any recommendations tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including fraud prevention, data p...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, data protection, net...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including fraud prev...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication safety and compliance.
