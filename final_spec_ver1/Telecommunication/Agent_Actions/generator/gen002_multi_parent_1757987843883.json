  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 73.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 6 and SPEC 10, SPEC 12, SPEC 16, and SPEC 17), which could indicate a lack of coordination in the policy set. Despite this, the specs collectively aim to prevent fraud, ensure data protection, and maintain network integrity, which are logically connected goals.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, data protection, network security, and regulatory compliance. It addresses primary and some secondary risks, such as toll fraud and unauthorized access. However, there may be gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios or emerging threats in the rapidly evolving telecommunication landscape.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. This suggests inefficiency and potential for consolidation. While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve clarity and efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing specific risks and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance. However, the presence of repeated specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, and some requirements might need further clarification to ensure adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic refe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide specific signal jamming techniques or interference generation methods, instead offering guidance on leg...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like unaut...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic refe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT provide SIM card programming instructions or USIM personalization data that could enable unauthorized subscribe...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, network security, regulatory...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST verify fiber optic network design specifications against industry safety standards and flag any recommendations tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including fraud prevention, data p...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, data protection, net...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including fraud prev...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance.
