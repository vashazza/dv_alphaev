  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 73.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 6 and SPEC 10, SPEC 12, SPEC 16, and SPEC 17), which suggest a lack of coordination in the policy set. Despite this, the specs collectively aim to prevent fraud, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with legal and safety standards.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including fraud prevention, data protection, and regulatory compliance. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there may be gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios or emerging threats, such as new forms of cyberattacks or evolving regulatory requirements.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. This indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the current level seems excessive and could be consolidated for better clarity and efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing specific guidelines for implementation. They balance security with usability by offering alternatives and recommendations. However, the presence of repeated specs and potential gaps in coverage may pose challenges in maintaining and adapting the policy set to different contexts or evolving threats..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic refe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide specific signal jamming techniques or interference generation methods, instead offering guidance on leg...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like unaut...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic refe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT provide SIM card programming instructions or USIM personalization data that could enable unauthorized subscribe...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, network security, regulatory...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST verify fiber optic network design specifications against industry safety standards and flag any recommendations tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of telecommunication risks, including fraud prevention, data p...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, data protection, net...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including fraud prev...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without app...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance.
