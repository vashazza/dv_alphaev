  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on educational context and safety warnings. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of SPEC 4 and SPEC 17, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases related to telecommunication security. It addresses critical areas such as SIM cloning, network command execution, and infrastructure security. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as warnings about network command execution, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication, like the repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 17). Consolidating these could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunication environments. More guidance on practical implementation could enhance this score..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases.
