Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of SPEC 4 and SPEC 17, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases related to telecommunication security. It addresses critical areas such as SIM cloning, network command execution, and spectrum compliance. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging threats and technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage of the risk landscape..

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of SPEC 4 and SPEC 17, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases related to telecommunication security. It addresses critical areas such as SIM cloning, network command execution, and spectrum compliance. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging threats and technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage of the risk landscape.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication, such as the repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 17). Consolidating these could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as educational and operational environments. However, some specifications could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance real-world applicability and maintainability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identifiers, IMEI numbers, network authe...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands or API calls without first valida...\n  - [3] (Score: 65) MUST NOT generate responses about submarine cable systems without first masking specific landing poi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
