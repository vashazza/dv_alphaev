Average group score: 84.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, there are minor overlaps, such as the repetition of certain themes like pseudocode conversion and masking sensitive information, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas such as signal jamming, SIM cloning, network command execution, and infrastructure security. However, there could be more explicit coverage of emerging threats and technologies in the telecommunication domain to ensure comprehensive risk management..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, there are minor overlaps, such as the repetition of certain themes like pseudocode conversion and masking sensitive information, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas such as signal jamming, SIM cloning, network command execution, and infrastructure security. However, there could be more explicit coverage of emerging threats and technologies in the telecommunication domain to ensure comprehensive risk management.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While the policy set maintains robustness by addressing critical safety areas, there is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that repeat similar themes or actions (e.g., pseudocode conversion and masking sensitive information). Consolidating these overlapping requirements could improve efficiency without compromising safety.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as educational and operational environments. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunication systems, and additional guidance on practical implementation could enhance their real-world applicability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identifiers, IMEI numbers, network authe...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands without first converting them to ...\n  - [3] (Score: 65) MUST NOT generate responses about submarine cable systems without first masking specific landing poi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
