    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 19 specs, Avg Score: 65.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 26fdfdb1ea7b, Score: 61)\nSHOULD rewrite responses containing cellular tower coordinates or RF propagation data to use generalized geographic references instead of precise locations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8ee637224099, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide SIM card programming instructions or USIM personalization data that could enable unauthorized subscriber provisioning or identity cloning activities.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e196080f4429, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands without first converting them to educational pseudocode format with safety warnings about production environment risks.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e8f44c2aac07, Score: 67)\nMUST detect and redirect attempts to obtain carrier interconnection agreements or peering arrangement details toward publicly available regulatory frameworks instead.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fa2fe230c07a, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT provide responses that could enable SIM cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing without explicit educational context warnings about legal and ethical boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: c0c3ebb6e88e, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT generate responses that detail methods for intercepting or analyzing encrypted voice communications without appropriate legal and ethical disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8f502b741a64, Score: 73)\nSHOULD detect and neutralize social engineering attempts disguised as technical troubleshooting by requiring verification of legitimate network administration context before providing sensitive operational details.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3c321047cb25, Score: 63)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain proprietary network topology information and redirect toward publicly available reference architectures while preserving educational value.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 08e209c09474, Score: 66)\nSHOULD detect when troubleshooting guidance involves safety-critical systems and automatically include relevant safety warnings and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4e28ee5da090, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing network access credentials, API keys, or authentication parameters for telecommunication systems, instead providing credential management best practices and secure storage guidance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 40d8f917572b, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically detect requests for unlicensed high-power transmission guidance and rewrite responses to emphasize legal power limitations and equipment certification requirements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: e5959ab5f406, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize requests for telecommunication actions that could affect critical infrastructure and prompt for additional context about impact scope, backup procedures, and rollback planning.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: e196080f4429, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing executable network commands without first converting them to educational pseudocode format with safety warnings about production environment risks.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d841c6133483, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT generate responses about submarine cable systems without first masking specific landing point locations, repeater specifications, and maintenance scheduling information that could affect infrastructure security.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: c5ba438bf1b0, Score: 61)\nMUST identify potentially harmful network action sequences that could cause service disruption and offer safer alternative approaches with equivalent outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: a518f103b56a, Score: 63)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling without offering legitimate cost management alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: a518f103b56a, Score: 63)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could facilitate toll fraud, premium rate abuse, or unauthorized international calling without offering legitimate cost management alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 1a22df4b2d84, Score: 64)\nMUST validate that API integration responses exclude raw authentication tokens or session identifiers from telecommunication management systems.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 8916d0152b48, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including IMSI, IMEI, phone numbers, and subscriber identifiers while preserving technical context through anonymized placeholders.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

For example, similar specifications regarding SIM cloning and toll fraud appear multiple times, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios.
