    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as validating actions against standards and ensuring data protection. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like data protection, network security, and regulatory compliance. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging technologies or less common threats in the telecommunication domain.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap in specifications related to security and compliance, it is generally appropriate for ensuring robustness. However, a few specs could be consolidated to reduce redundancy without compromising safety, particularly those addressing similar security threats.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunication environments due to varying infrastructure and regulatory landscapes."
