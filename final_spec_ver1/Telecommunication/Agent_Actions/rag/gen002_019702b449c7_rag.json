    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 6 and SPEC 10, SPEC 12, SPEC 16, and SPEC 17), which suggest a lack of coordination in the policy set. Despite this, the specs collectively aim to prevent fraud, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with legal and safety standards.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunication domain, including fraud prevention, data protection, and regulatory compliance. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there may be gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios or emerging threats, such as new forms of cyberattacks or evolving regulatory requirements.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. This indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the current level seems excessive and could be consolidated for better clarity and efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing specific guidelines for implementation. They balance security with usability by offering alternatives and recommendations. However, the presence of repeated specs and potential gaps in coverage may pose challenges in maintaining and adapting the policy set to different contexts or evolving threats."
