    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of telecommunications security and privacy, such as fraud prevention, privacy compliance, and network security. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9), which slightly disrupt the cohesion by introducing redundancy without adding new dimensions to the policy set.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including fraud, privacy, security, and compliance with standards. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging threats, which could be better covered to enhance the overall risk landscape coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9, and SPEC 12 and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of redundant specifications could complicate maintenance and implementation, slightly reducing practicality."
