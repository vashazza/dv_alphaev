    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications information processing. They cover various aspects such as compliance, security, and privacy, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set addresses a broad range of scenarios, including compliance, security, privacy, and emergency preparedness. It covers primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 7, SPEC 16 and SPEC 1, SPEC 17 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within telecommunications. However, the presence of repeated specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance."
