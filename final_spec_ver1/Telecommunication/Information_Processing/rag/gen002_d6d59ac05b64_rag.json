    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications information processing. They address various aspects of security, privacy, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 7) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. It addresses primary and some secondary risks, such as unauthorized access and data protection. However, there are gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common regulatory environments, which could be improved for comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 16, 17, and 18) that could be consolidated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the current level could be streamlined to enhance efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunications environments. Simplifying and clarifying certain specs could improve real-world applicability and maintainability."
