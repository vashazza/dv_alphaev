    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security, privacy, and compliance in telecommunications. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting unauthorized requests to compliant alternatives and ensuring data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, data protection, and compliance with regulatory standards. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications to enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for compliance. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, and the presence of repeated specs may complicate maintenance."
