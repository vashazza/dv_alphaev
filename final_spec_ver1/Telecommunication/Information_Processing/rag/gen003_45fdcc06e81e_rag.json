    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications information processing. They address various aspects of security, compliance, and data handling, with logical connections between requirements such as compliance verification, data redaction, and security considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 17, SPEC 5 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security, privacy, and data integrity. It addresses primary and some secondary risks, such as unauthorized data access and regulatory breaches. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common security threats.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 17, SPEC 5 and SPEC 18, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13). While this provides robustness in critical areas, it also indicates inefficiencies that could be streamlined. The redundancy is not excessive but could be optimized for better efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing guidelines for safe information processing. However, some specifications may require further clarification or adaptation for specific contexts, which could impact their ease of implementation."
