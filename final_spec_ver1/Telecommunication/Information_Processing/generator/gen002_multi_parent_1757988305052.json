Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications security and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy compliance and security best practices. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, emergency preparedness, and security best practices. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging threats or less common vulnerabilities..

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy compliance and security best practices. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, emergency preparedness, and security best practices. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging threats or less common vulnerabilities.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9, as well as SPEC 12 and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the telecommunications domain. However, the presence of repeated specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance efforts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST detect social engineering attempts disguised as technical support requests and redirect to veri...\n  - [2] (Score: 68) MUST detect adversarial inputs attempting to extract confidential network operator information throu...\n  - [3] (Score: 66) MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that co...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
