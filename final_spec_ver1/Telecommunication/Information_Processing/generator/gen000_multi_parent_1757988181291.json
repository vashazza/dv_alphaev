  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security, privacy, and compliance in telecommunications. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting unauthorized requests to compliant alternatives and ensuring data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, data protection, and compliance with regulatory standards. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications to enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance for compliance. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, and the presence of repeated specs may complicate maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring tele...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, compliance, and operational gu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific jamming patterns, interference techniques, or signal disruption methods ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent network certification documentation and redirect to legitimate testing labor...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, data protection, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on security, privacy, and compliance in telecommunications.
