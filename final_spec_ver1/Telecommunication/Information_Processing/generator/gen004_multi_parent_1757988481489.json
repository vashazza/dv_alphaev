Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring telecommunications security and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 12, SPEC 18 and SPEC 11) that slightly disrupt the cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, compliance, and operational guidance. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, such as unauthorized access and signal interference. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common protocols..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with standards. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 12, SPEC 18 and SPEC 11) that slightly disrupt the cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, compliance, and operational guidance. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, such as unauthorized access and signal interference. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common protocols.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated specs that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical areas, the repetition of certain specs suggests a lack of optimization in the policy set.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs may require additional clarification to ensure consistent implementation across various scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 58) MUST NOT present network capacity planning that could encourage infrastructure overloading or servic...\n  - [2] (Score: 80) MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere w...\n  - [3] (Score: 66) MUST detect and neutralize embedded commands within telecommunications protocol descriptions that co...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
