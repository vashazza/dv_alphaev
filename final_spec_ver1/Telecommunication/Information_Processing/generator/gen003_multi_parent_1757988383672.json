  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications information processing. They address various aspects of security, compliance, and data handling, with logical connections between requirements such as compliance verification, data redaction, and security considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 17, SPEC 5 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security, privacy, and data integrity. It addresses primary and some secondary risks, such as unauthorized data access and regulatory breaches. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common security threats.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 17, SPEC 5 and SPEC 18, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13). While this provides robustness in critical areas, it also indicates inefficiencies that could be streamlined. The redundancy is not excessive but could be optimized for better efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing guidelines for safe information processing. However, some specifications may require further clarification or adaptation for specific contexts, which could impact their ease of implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access prevention, data protecti...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy protection, and com...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access prevention, data p...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and regulatory compli...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate wireless frequency allocation recommendations without first confirming regulatory jurisdiction and app...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications information processing.
