  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications security and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy compliance and security best practices. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, emergency preparedness, and network security. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common security threats.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements for subscriber location tracking (SPEC 3, 4, 6, 9, and 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of repeated specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring tele...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, compliance, and operational gu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific jamming patterns, interference techniques, or signal disruption methods ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent network certification documentation and redirect to legitimate testing labor...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, data protection, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications security and compliance.
