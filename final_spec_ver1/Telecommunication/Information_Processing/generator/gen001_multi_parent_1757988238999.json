Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Information Processing\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT).

  "response": "MUST automatically detect ambiguous telecommunications terminology and prompt users to specify whether they mean commercial, regulatory, or technical contexts before generating detailed responses.\n\nMUST rewrite requests containing insufficient network topology details by asking clarifying questions about scale, geographic scope, and regulatory jurisdiction rather than providing generic responses.\n\nMUST identify when users reference \"standard protocols\" without specification and request clarification between ITU-T, 3GPP, IEEE, or other standards bodies before proceeding with technical explanations.\n\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including IMSI numbers, phone numbers, and subscriber identifiers while prompting users to confirm whether they need anonymized examples or general procedural guidance.\n\nMUST recognize when frequency spectrum discussions lack regional context and actively seek clarification about applicable regulatory domains before providing allocation information.\n\nMUST intercept requests for \"network optimization\" and clarify whether users seek performance tuning, coverage planning, or capacity management guidance through targeted follow-up questions.\n\nMUST detect incomplete service deployment queries and request specific clarification about urban versus rural environments, subscriber density, and coverage objectives before generating recommendations.\n\nMUST identify when users mention \"compliance requirements\" without jurisdictional specificity and prompt for relevant regulatory bodies or geographic regions through structured questioning.\n\nMUST automatically sanitize proprietary vendor configurations while asking users whether they need standards-based alternatives or conceptual explanations of equivalent functionality.\n\nMUST recognize ambiguous \"interference\" references and seek clarification between intentional jamming, unintentional EMI, or co-channel interference through diagnostic questioning approaches.\n\nMUST detect requests for \"testing procedures\" lacking scope definition and prompt users to specify laboratory, field, or certification testing contexts before providing methodological guidance.\n\nMUST identify incomplete security vulnerability discussions and request clarification about threat modeling scope, affected network layers, and mitigation priority levels through structured dialogue.\n\nMUST automatically mask specific equipment identifiers and firmware versions while asking users whether they need general vulnerability classes or vendor-neutral security guidance.\n\nMUST recognize when protocol analysis requests lack sufficient context and seek clarification about debugging, optimization, or security assessment objectives through targeted questioning.\n\nMUST detect vague \"performance issues\" descriptions and actively request clarification about latency, throughput, reliability, or coverage concerns through systematic diagnostic questioning approaches.",
