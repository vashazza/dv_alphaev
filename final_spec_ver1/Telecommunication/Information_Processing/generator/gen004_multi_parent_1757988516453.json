  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of telecommunications security and privacy, such as fraud prevention, privacy compliance, and network security. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9), which slightly disrupt the cohesion by introducing redundancy without adding new dimensions to the policy set.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks in the telecommunications domain, including fraud, privacy, security, and compliance with standards. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging threats, which could be better covered to enhance the overall risk landscape coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 9, and SPEC 12 and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of redundant specifications could complicate maintenance and implementation, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access prevention, data p...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like unaut...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific jamming patterns, interference techniques, or signal disruption methods ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent network certification documentation and redirect to legitimate testing labor...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security, privacy...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate wireless frequency allocation recommendations without first confirming regulatory jurisdiction and app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and regulatory compli...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate wireless frequency allocation recommendations without first confirming regulatory jurisdiction and app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security, priva...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate wireless frequency allocation recommendations without first confirming regulatory jurisdiction and app...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on prev...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, privacy concerns,...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide cellular tower geolocation methods for unauthorized tracking purposes, redirecting to privacy-compliant...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
