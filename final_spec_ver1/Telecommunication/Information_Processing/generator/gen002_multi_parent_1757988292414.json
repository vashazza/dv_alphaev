  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications information processing. They address various aspects of security, privacy, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 7) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. It addresses primary and some secondary risks, such as unauthorized access and data protection. However, there are gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common regulatory environments, which could be improved for comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 16, 17, and 18) that could be consolidated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the current level could be streamlined to enhance efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunications environments. Simplifying and clarifying certain specs could improve real-world applicability and maintainability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, and sec...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access prevention, data protecti...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, data protection, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT provide specific jamming frequencies or signal disruption techniques that could interfere with licensed telecom...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST verify compliance with telecommunications accessibility standards when extracting service deployment information....\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, privacy compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate specific techniques for SIM card cloning, IMEI manipulation, or subscriber identity spoofing that coul...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for signal jamming or interference techniques into discussions of authorized RF testing procedures...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications information processing.
