  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 57.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally aim to enhance security and accuracy in telecommunications, focusing on user intent verification, data masking, and safety in multimodal interactions. However, the presence of identical specs (e.g., repeated specs for data masking and user intent verification) suggests a lack of integration and coordination, reducing overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set addresses several important areas, such as user intent verification, data privacy, and security in multimodal tasks. However, the repeated specs indicate potential gaps in addressing other critical areas, such as network performance or broader compliance issues, which are not covered.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, with multiple identical specifications (e.g., specs for data masking and user intent verification repeated several times). This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to streamline the policy set, reducing unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like user intent verification and data masking. However, the repetition of specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, as it could lead to confusion or oversight in real-world applications..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommuni...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST verify user intent when processing speech-to-text telecommunications queries that contain technical jargon potentia...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT produce multimodal content demonstrating physical network infrastructure vulnerabilities alongside exploitable ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
