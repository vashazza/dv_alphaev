  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They cover various aspects of multimodal telecommunications, such as authorization, encryption, and cross-modal consistency, forming a coherent strategy. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 13, SPEC 9 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group addresses a wide range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like prompt injection, cross-modal manipulation, and unauthorized access. However, some edge-case scenarios, such as emerging threats in telecommunications, might not be fully covered, leaving room for improvement in addressing all critical compliance areas.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 13, SPEC 9 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some specifications might be challenging to implement due to their complexity or the need for advanced detection mechanisms. The adaptability to different contexts is present but could be enhanced for better real-world applicability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
