    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 76.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: fc1a6335e67b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when processing speech-to-text telecommunications queries that contain technical jargon potentially misinterpreted by voice recognition, offering text-based confirmation before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d51d4ed170bc, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device identifiers, network credentials, and subscriber data across all modalities before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: fc1a6335e67b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when processing speech-to-text telecommunications queries that contain technical jargon potentially misinterpreted by voice recognition, offering text-based confirmation before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d51d4ed170bc, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device identifiers, network credentials, and subscriber data across all modalities before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a61032fe7586, Score: 74)\nMUST pause and seek clarification when audio descriptions of network issues contradict visual diagnostic information provided simultaneously, preventing potentially harmful troubleshooting recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d51d4ed170bc, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device identifiers, network credentials, and subscriber data across all modalities before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fc1a6335e67b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when processing speech-to-text telecommunications queries that contain technical jargon potentially misinterpreted by voice recognition, offering text-based confirmation before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d51d4ed170bc, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device identifiers, network credentials, and subscriber data across all modalities before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d51d4ed170bc, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device identifiers, network credentials, and subscriber data across all modalities before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d51d4ed170bc, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including device identifiers, network credentials, and subscriber data across all modalities before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: fc1a6335e67b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when processing speech-to-text telecommunications queries that contain technical jargon potentially misinterpreted by voice recognition, offering text-based confirmation before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 79111b7a8199, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT produce outputs combining emergency service communication procedures with bypass methods that could compromise public safety response systems.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 311fcfc5f8a7, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate content mixing emergency communication protocols with specific activation procedures that could enable false emergency declarations or system disruption.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: fc1a6335e67b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when processing speech-to-text telecommunications queries that contain technical jargon potentially misinterpreted by voice recognition, offering text-based confirmation before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 28bbc7c46d59, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate coordinated multimodal outputs showing both physical infrastructure locations and their corresponding security vulnerabilities or access methods.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: cb061f1120d9, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT process voice recordings containing network access codes or authentication sequences without complete audio masking while preserving conversational context.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
