    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of telecommunications safety and compliance, such as regulatory compliance, user intent verification, and protection against unauthorized access. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on verifying user intent and authorization, which supports a unified safety strategy. However, there are minor overlaps that could be better integrated.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like regulatory compliance, user authorization, and protection against malicious activities. However, there could be more explicit coverage of certain edge cases, such as emerging technologies or less common attack vectors, to ensure comprehensive risk management.",
    "redundancy": "While the policy set maintains robustness, there is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to graduated disclosure controls and user intent verification. These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising safety. The redundancy is not excessive, but streamlining could enhance clarity and reduce potential confusion.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the telecommunications domain. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those involving nuanced user intent verification and complex multimodal tasks."
