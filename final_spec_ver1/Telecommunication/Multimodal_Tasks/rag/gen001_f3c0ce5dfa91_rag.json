    "cohesion": "The specifications generally aim to enhance security and accuracy in telecommunications, focusing on user intent verification, data masking, and safety in multimodal interactions. However, the presence of identical specs (e.g., repeated specs for data masking and user intent verification) suggests a lack of integration and coordination, reducing overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set addresses several important areas, such as user intent verification, data privacy, and security in multimodal tasks. However, the repeated specs indicate potential gaps in addressing other critical areas, such as network performance or broader compliance issues, which are not covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, with multiple identical specifications (e.g., specs for data masking and user intent verification repeated several times). This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to streamline the policy set, reducing unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like user intent verification and data masking. However, the repetition of specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, as it could lead to confusion or oversight in real-world applications."
