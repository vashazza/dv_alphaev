  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to enhance security, compliance, and privacy in telecommunications. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory compliance and security authorization. However, there is a repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14), which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, such as unauthorized access and spectrum allocation. However, some edge-case scenarios, like emerging technology risks, could be more thoroughly addressed.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14). While redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the overlap here could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by anonymizing sensitive data and ensuring regulatory compliance. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, particularly in rapidly evolving technological environments..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory complianc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD automatically rewrite requests for cellular network vulnerability assessments to focus on defensive hardening rec...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite responses containing specific customer network configurations or deployment details to use anonymized, gene...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for addressing telecom...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias detection, safety filtering, and validat...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 62): MUST identify potential bias sources in network measurement data or analytical methodologies that could skew conclusions...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 57): MUST qualify analytical assessments of emerging telecommunications technologies by acknowledging prototype versus produc...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory compliance, and ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD automatically rewrite requests for cellular network vulnerability assessments to focus on defensive hardening rec...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite responses containing specific customer network configurations or deployment details to use anonymized, gene...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market analysis, network performance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD apply bias detection filters when analyzing telecommunications market data to identify potential discrimination i...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT proceed with telecommunications analysis when fundamental technical parameters remain ambiguous, and SHOULD pro...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, unauthorized access prevent...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST cross-reference network security vulnerability analysis against current threat intelligence databases before presen...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT generate reasoning chains that could enable unauthorized cellular network access, base station manipulation, or...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework.
