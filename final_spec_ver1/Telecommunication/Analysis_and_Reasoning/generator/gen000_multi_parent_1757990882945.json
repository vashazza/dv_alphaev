  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications security and compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of network security, regulatory compliance, and operational integrity. However, there is a repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory compliance, and operational safety. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the duplication of SPEC 4 and SPEC 14. While redundancy is minimal, the repeated specification suggests a need for consolidation. The group maintains necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, but further streamlining could enhance efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within telecommunications. However, some specifications could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance real-world applicability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory complianc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD automatically rewrite requests for cellular network vulnerability assessments to focus on defensive hardening rec...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite responses containing specific customer network configurations or deployment details to use anonymized, gene...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for addressing telecom...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias detection, safety filtering, and validat...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 62): MUST identify potential bias sources in network measurement data or analytical methodologies that could skew conclusions...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 57): MUST qualify analytical assessments of emerging telecommunications technologies by acknowledging prototype versus produc...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market analysis, network performance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD apply bias detection filters when analyzing telecommunications market data to identify potential discrimination i...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT proceed with telecommunications analysis when fundamental technical parameters remain ambiguous, and SHOULD pro...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, unauthorized access prevent...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST cross-reference network security vulnerability analysis against current threat intelligence databases before presen...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT generate reasoning chains that could enable unauthorized cellular network access, base station manipulation, or...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications security and compliance.
