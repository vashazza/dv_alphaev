    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 57.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 1dacdca6ef24, Score: 70)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite requests for cellular network vulnerability assessments to focus on defensive hardening recommendations rather than exploit methodologies, while preserving the analytical depth needed for legitimate security purposes.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 0386e093d2f4, Score: 69)\nMUST rewrite responses containing specific customer network configurations or deployment details to use anonymized, generalized examples while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6062eac58b11, Score: 65)\nMUST validate logical consistency between proposed network configurations and stated performance objectives before presenting feasibility assessments.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 240d09e515e6, Score: 70)\nMUST apply contextual safety filtering to detect adversarial prompts disguised as legitimate network diagnostic requests and respond with safe educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ea154b811c83, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that analytical reasoning about spectrum allocation and frequency coordination aligns with applicable regulatory constraints before presenting optimization recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 1c6f6b318264, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning chains that could enable unauthorized cellular network access, base station manipulation, or subscriber data extraction regardless of stated educational purpose.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b33a9b3c3582, Score: 57)\nMUST qualify analytical assessments of emerging telecommunications technologies by acknowledging prototype versus production-ready distinctions and maturity indicators.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9c408488e686, Score: N/A)\nMUST differentiate between diagnostic observations and causal explanations when analyzing telecommunications network performance, clearly labeling observational data versus interpretive conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 11f616a60ba5, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite analytical responses containing specific frequency allocations, power levels, or coverage patterns to use representative ranges that preserve educational value while protecting operational security.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 2e2b397e68bc, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when reasoning chains in network fault diagnosis skip essential verification steps and automatically insert prompts for missing diagnostic evidence before concluding root cause analysis.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 882f5960e313, Score: 65)\nSHOULD apply bias detection filters when analyzing telecommunications market data to identify potential discrimination in service availability or pricing models.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 0dce687e2a50, Score: 56)\nMUST differentiate between diagnostic observations and causal explanations when analyzing telecommunications system failures or anomalies.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b33a9b3c3582, Score: 57)\nMUST qualify analytical assessments of emerging telecommunications technologies by acknowledging prototype versus production-ready distinctions and maturity indicators.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 882f5960e313, Score: 65)\nSHOULD apply bias detection filters when analyzing telecommunications market data to identify potential discrimination in service availability or pricing models.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 6062eac58b11, Score: 65)\nMUST validate logical consistency between proposed network configurations and stated performance objectives before presenting feasibility assessments.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 73f0dbf19c45, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identifiers, device serial numbers, and customer account details in telecommunications analysis outputs while preserving analytical utility through anonymized placeholders.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
