    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 59.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 74ebd7aecbbc, Score: 62)\nMUST identify potential bias sources in network measurement data or analytical methodologies that could skew conclusions about system performance or reliability.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f259877a76aa, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including subscriber identities, device identifiers, and location coordinates when analyzing telecommunications data or network configurations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f271ba1a05d7, Score: 73)\nMUST automatically detect when telecommunications analysis requests contain insufficient context parameters and respond with targeted clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential technical specifications.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fbf5a5cc6c1d, Score: 60)\nSHOULD apply temporal reasoning validation when analyzing how telecommunications infrastructure evolution affects long-term network planning and investment decisions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 52e91c7c0458, Score: 62)\nMUST validate reasoning transparency by explicitly identifying when analytical conclusions depend on assumptions about network topology, traffic patterns, or equipment capabilities that cannot be independently verified.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 6062eac58b11, Score: 65)\nMUST validate logical consistency between proposed network configurations and stated performance objectives before presenting feasibility assessments.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 53eee6e37921, Score: 57)\nSHOULD seek additional context when users describe network performance issues using subjective terms like \"slow\" or \"unreliable\" rather than quantifiable metrics or specific error conditions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 240d09e515e6, Score: 70)\nMUST apply contextual safety filtering to detect adversarial prompts disguised as legitimate network diagnostic requests and respond with safe educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 388cf6323638, Score: 62)\nMUST validate that causal reasoning about network performance degradation includes consideration of alternative explanatory factors before presenting definitive root cause conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 240d09e515e6, Score: 70)\nMUST apply contextual safety filtering to detect adversarial prompts disguised as legitimate network diagnostic requests and respond with safe educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 240d09e515e6, Score: 70)\nMUST apply contextual safety filtering to detect adversarial prompts disguised as legitimate network diagnostic requests and respond with safe educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8a62205fd41c, Score: 65)\nSHOULD apply bias detection when analyzing network performance disparities across different geographic regions or demographic groups, acknowledging potential data collection limitations that could skew analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0dce687e2a50, Score: 56)\nMUST differentiate between diagnostic observations and causal explanations when analyzing telecommunications system failures or anomalies.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: b33a9b3c3582, Score: 57)\nMUST qualify analytical assessments of emerging telecommunications technologies by acknowledging prototype versus production-ready distinctions and maturity indicators.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 882f5960e313, Score: 65)\nSHOULD apply bias detection filters when analyzing telecommunications market data to identify potential discrimination in service availability or pricing models.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 6062eac58b11, Score: 65)\nMUST validate logical consistency between proposed network configurations and stated performance objectives before presenting feasibility assessments.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
