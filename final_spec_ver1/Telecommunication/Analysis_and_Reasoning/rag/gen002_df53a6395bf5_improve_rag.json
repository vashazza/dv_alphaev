    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications analysis and safety. They address various aspects of data handling, analysis, and security, with logical connections between requirements such as bias detection, reasoning transparency, and safety filtering. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the repeated specifications regarding contextual safety filtering.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias detection, privacy protection, reasoning validation, and safety measures against adversarial actions. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively but lacks explicit coverage of certain edge cases, such as emerging technologies or specific regulatory compliance requirements.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications on contextual safety filtering (Specs 10, 13, and 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, though some requirements may be challenging to adapt across different contexts without additional guidance or flexibility."
