    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to enhance security, compliance, and privacy within the telecommunications domain. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the focus on regulatory compliance, security hardening, and user authorization. However, there is a repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14), which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, such as unauthorized access and spectrum allocation. However, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as preventing unauthorized access and ensuring regulatory compliance, there are instances of overlapping requirements that could be consolidated. The repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14) indicates some inefficiency in avoiding duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on security and compliance. They are designed to be implementable in real-world scenarios, balancing security with usability. However, some specifications may require additional context or resources to be fully adaptable to different operational environments."
