    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication security and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing threat intelligence (SPEC 1) and ensuring logical consistency in network configurations (SPEC 5). However, some specifications could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion, such as aligning bias detection efforts (SPEC 4 and SPEC 16) more closely with other security measures.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, unauthorized access prevention, and data privacy. Primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, such as unauthorized network access (SPEC 2) and network outage analysis (SPEC 11). However, there are potential gaps in addressing emerging threats and edge-case scenarios, such as new forms of cyberattacks or evolving regulatory requirements.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of cryptographic parameter filtering (SPEC 10 and SPEC 12). While redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication, but further streamlining could enhance clarity and reduce overlap.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as validating user authorization (SPEC 7) and ensuring logical evidence chains (SPEC 9). However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, and balancing security with usability could be improved, particularly in complex scenarios like bias detection (SPEC 4 and SPEC 16)."
