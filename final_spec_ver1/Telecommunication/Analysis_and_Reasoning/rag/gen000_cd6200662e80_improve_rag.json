    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for addressing telecommunications analysis and safety. They cover various aspects of network performance, safety, and analysis, with logical connections between requirements such as bias detection, reasoning validation, and safety filtering. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias detection, safety filtering, and validation of analytical methods. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications to enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications (Specs 10, 13, and 14) regarding contextual safety filtering. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, this repetition seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, but some requirements could be more adaptable to different contexts, and the presence of redundant specs may complicate maintenance."
