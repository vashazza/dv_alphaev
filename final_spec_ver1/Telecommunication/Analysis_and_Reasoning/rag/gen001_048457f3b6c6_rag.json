    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to enhance security, compliance, and privacy in telecommunications. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on regulatory compliance and security authorization. However, there is a repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14), which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, such as unauthorized access and spectrum allocation. However, some edge-case scenarios, like emerging technology risks, could be more thoroughly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14). While redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the overlap here could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by anonymizing sensitive data and ensuring regulatory compliance. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, particularly in rapidly evolving technological environments."
