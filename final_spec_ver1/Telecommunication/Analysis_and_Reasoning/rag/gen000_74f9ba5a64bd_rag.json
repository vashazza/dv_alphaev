    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications security and compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of network security, regulatory compliance, and operational integrity. However, there is a repeated specification (SPEC 4 and SPEC 14), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, regulatory compliance, and operational safety. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the duplication of SPEC 4 and SPEC 14. While redundancy is minimal, the repeated specification suggests a need for consolidation. The group maintains necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, but further streamlining could enhance efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within telecommunications. However, some specifications could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance real-world applicability."
