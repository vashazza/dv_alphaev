    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications safety and compliance. They address various aspects of security, regulatory compliance, and user safety. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 11, 13, 14) that could be consolidated to improve cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security vulnerabilities, and user safety. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common regulatory environments.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 11, 13, 14). While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be streamlined to enhance efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, the presence of repeated specs suggests potential challenges in implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these could improve practicality and adaptability."
