    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications safety and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing engineering principles and verifying regulatory compliance. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like unauthorized access and secondary issues like regulatory compliance. It also addresses edge cases such as cross-border inquiries and deprecated protocols. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies and their associated risks, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as verifying compliance and preventing unauthorized access, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as SPEC 9 and SPEC 10 being identical. This duplication could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory jurisdictions. However, some specifications may be challenging to implement consistently, particularly those requiring real-time verification and dialogue initiation, which could impact practicality."
