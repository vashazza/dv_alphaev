    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications security and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing security vulnerabilities and redirecting sensitive requests to appropriate channels. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including outdated protocols, network security, privacy concerns, and emergency communications. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively, but there may be gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common network configurations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., cross-referencing security vulnerabilities and outdated protocol information). While this provides robustness, it could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication without compromising safety.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunications environments, particularly those involving complex network configurations."
