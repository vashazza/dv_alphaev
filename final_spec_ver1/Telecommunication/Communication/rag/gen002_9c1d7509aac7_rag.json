    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommunications safety and compliance. They address various aspects of network security, fraud prevention, and user safety, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some areas where the integration could be improved, such as ensuring consistent terminology and approach across all specs.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like fraud, unauthorized access, and safety protocols. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications, which could be better covered to enhance the overall risk landscape.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12, 13, 14) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some specs could benefit from more precise language to enhance implementability and maintenance in real-world scenarios."
