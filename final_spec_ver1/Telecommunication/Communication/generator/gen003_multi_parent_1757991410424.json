  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications safety and compliance. They address various aspects of security, regulatory compliance, and user safety. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 11, 13, 14) that could be consolidated to improve cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security vulnerabilities, and user safety. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common regulatory environments.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 11, 13, 14). While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be streamlined to enhance efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, the presence of repeated specs suggests potential challenges in implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these could improve practicality and adaptability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including outdated protocols, network security, pr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect and rewrite responses containing outdated protocol information by flagging deprecated standards and suggesti...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD request clarification about equipment types and network environments when troubleshooting guidance could vary sig...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that addresses various...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including outdated protocols, network security, pr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect and rewrite responses containing outdated protocol information by flagging deprecated standards and suggesti...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD request clarification about equipment types and network environments when troubleshooting guidance could vary sig...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like unauthorized access a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): MUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to preve...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, safety warnings, and s...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): MUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to preve...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on preventing misinformation, ensuring reg...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of telecommunications risks, including regulatory compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): MUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to preve...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security vulner...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): MUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to preve...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications safety and compliance.
