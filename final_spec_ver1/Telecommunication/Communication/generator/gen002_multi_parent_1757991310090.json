  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications safety and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing engineering principles and verifying regulatory compliance. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like unauthorized access and secondary issues like regulatory compliance. It also addresses edge cases such as cross-border inquiries and deprecated protocols. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies and their associated risks, which could enhance the coverage..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing engineering principles and verifying regulatory compliance. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like unauthorized access and secondary issues like regulatory compliance. It also addresses edge cases such as cross-border inquiries and deprecated protocols. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies and their associated risks, which could enhance the coverage.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as verifying compliance and preventing unauthorized access, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as SPEC 9 and SPEC 10 being identical. This duplication could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory jurisdictions. However, some specifications may be challenging to implement consistently, particularly those requiring real-time verification and dialogue initiation, which could impact practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 57) MUST recognize cross-border telecommunications inquiries and flag potential export control or nation...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST initiate clarifying dialogue when users request telecommunications guidance without specifying ...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST initiate verification dialogue when users request assistance with signal interception, traffic ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
