  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommunications safety and compliance. They address various aspects of network security, fraud prevention, and user safety, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some areas where the integration could be improved, such as ensuring consistent terminology and approach across all specs.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like fraud, unauthorized access, and safety protocols. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications, which could be better covered to enhance the overall risk landscape.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12, 13, 14) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some specs could benefit from more precise language to enhance implementability and maintenance in real-world scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including signal interception, fraud, unauthorized...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST initiate verification dialogue when users request assistance with signal interception, traffic analysis, or monitor...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST detect and rewrite responses containing detailed cellular handoff procedures or roaming authentication flows that c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunications...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of risks, including unauthorized access, regulatory compliance, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST detect and rewrite responses containing detailed cellular handoff procedures or roaming authentication flows that c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including outdated protocols, network security, pr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect and rewrite responses containing outdated protocol information by flagging deprecated standards and suggesti...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD request clarification about equipment types and network environments when troubleshooting guidance could vary sig...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that addresses various...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, security vulnerab...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): MUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to preve...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, network securit...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): MUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to preve...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, safety warnings, and s...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): MUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to preve...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configur...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommunications safety and compliance.
