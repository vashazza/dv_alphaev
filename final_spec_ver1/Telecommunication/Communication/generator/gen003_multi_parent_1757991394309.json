Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications security and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing security vulnerabilities and redirecting sensitive requests to appropriate channels. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including outdated protocols, network security, privacy concerns, and emergency communications. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively, but there may be gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common network configurations..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing security vulnerabilities and redirecting sensitive requests to appropriate channels. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including outdated protocols, network security, privacy concerns, and emergency communications. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively, but there may be gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common network configurations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., cross-referencing security vulnerabilities and outdated protocol information). While this provides robustness, it could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary duplication without compromising safety.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse telecommunications environments, particularly those involving complex network configurations.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) SHOULD request clarification about equipment types and network environments when troubleshooting gui...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST initiate clarifying dialogue when users request telecommunications guidance without specifying ...\n  - [3] (Score: 66) SHOULD rewrite requests for unauthorized network access methods into educational content about prope...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
