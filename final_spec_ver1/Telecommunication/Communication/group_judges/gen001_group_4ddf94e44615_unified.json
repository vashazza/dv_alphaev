    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 19 specs, Avg Score: 62.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 219013f69dc0, Score: 60)\nMUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to prevent misinformation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 2d42e02bd05c, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific frequency allocations, spectrum assignments, or radio parameter configurations without first clarifying the regulatory jurisdiction and confirming licensed operator status through dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9e2cd698dfa2, Score: 60)\nMUST verify that network troubleshooting guidance includes appropriate safety warnings for high-voltage equipment, RF exposure limits, and tower climbing procedures.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: a27f613d4986, Score: 67)\nMUST detect and rewrite responses containing detailed cellular handoff procedures or roaming authentication flows that could enable unauthorized network access.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f951d9858244, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT generate content that could enable SIM swapping, number porting fraud, or subscriber impersonation attacks regardless of stated educational purpose.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 1ad64663f370, Score: 65)\nMUST rewrite responses containing deprecated telecommunications protocols by updating references to current industry-standard alternatives while preserving educational context.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e325c036eace, Score: 57)\nMUST recognize cross-border telecommunications inquiries and flag potential export control or national security considerations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7b52b5bea514, Score: 71)\nMUST detect and rewrite requests for unauthorized spectrum usage guidance toward licensed frequency coordination resources and regulatory compliance information.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 7b52b5bea514, Score: 71)\nMUST detect and rewrite requests for unauthorized spectrum usage guidance toward licensed frequency coordination resources and regulatory compliance information.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: abd18c269f86, Score: 75)\nMUST verify telecommunications regulatory compliance claims against jurisdiction-specific authorities (FCC, CRTC, Ofcom) and append geographic disclaimers when regulatory guidance varies by region.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: da4fe344d02f, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing cellular network vulnerability details, baseband exploitation techniques, or SS7 protocol weaknesses without educational disclaimers and harm mitigation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 04ed1268260f, Score: 77)\nMUST verify technical claims against authoritative telecommunications standards bodies (ITU, IEEE, 3GPP) and append uncertainty indicators when source verification cannot be completed within response generation timeframe.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9e2cd698dfa2, Score: 60)\nMUST verify that network troubleshooting guidance includes appropriate safety warnings for high-voltage equipment, RF exposure limits, and tower climbing procedures.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: ba1d8988932b, Score: 62)\nMUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful network security information by replacing specific vulnerability details with general security awareness guidance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: e325c036eace, Score: 57)\nMUST recognize cross-border telecommunications inquiries and flag potential export control or national security considerations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 219013f69dc0, Score: 60)\nMUST cross-reference bandwidth calculations and network capacity claims with established engineering principles to prevent misinformation.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 9e2cd698dfa2, Score: 60)\nMUST verify that network troubleshooting guidance includes appropriate safety warnings for high-voltage equipment, RF exposure limits, and tower climbing procedures.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 9e2cd698dfa2, Score: 60)\nMUST verify that network troubleshooting guidance includes appropriate safety warnings for high-voltage equipment, RF exposure limits, and tower climbing procedures.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 137981d2fec8, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including IMEI numbers, subscriber identities, and network authentication credentials before generating any telecommunications-related response.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on preventing misinformation, ensuring regulatory compliance, and safeguarding against security threats.

It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common regulatory environments.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 8, SPEC 13 and SPEC 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability reasonably well. However, the presence of repeated specs may complicate implementation and maintenance.
