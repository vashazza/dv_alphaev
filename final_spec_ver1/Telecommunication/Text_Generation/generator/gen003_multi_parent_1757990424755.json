  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhancing security and compliance in telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of network security, privacy, and performance optimization. However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, and emergency services bypass. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively but lacks explicit coverage of certain edge cases, such as emerging technology risks and specific compliance standards.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 9 and 4, Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests to legitimate topics. They balance security with usability, but the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance. The specs are adaptable but could benefit from more explicit guidelines for different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhanc...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, and eme...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST NOT provide detailed methodologies for signal interception or traffic analysis, automatically reframing such querie...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST NOT provide detailed methodologies for signal interception or traffic analysis, automatically reframing such querie...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunication ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including PII protection, infrastructure security,...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, customer account identifier...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and redirect attempts to generate content that could compromise critical communication infrast...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 67/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group addresses several important areas such as VoIP disruption, network documentation, and capa...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST verify that generated troubleshooting procedures align with standard safety protocols and include appropriate warni...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at enhancing sec...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, em...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST NOT provide detailed methodologies for signal interception or traffic analysis, automatically reframing such querie...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety, ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including safety, security, and privacy concerns.
