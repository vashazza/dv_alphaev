  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 67.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security, safety, and performance optimization in telecommunications. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion and reduce redundancy.. Coverage: The group addresses several important areas such as VoIP disruption, network documentation, and capacity planning. However, there are gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications, which could be better covered.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of identical or very similar specs (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 10, 13, and 14, SPEC 11, 15, and 16). This repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting potentially harmful requests and maintaining security. However, the presence of redundant specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, and some specs could benefit from more explicit guidance on adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for ensuring safety an...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including PII protection, infrastructure security, misi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, customer account identifier...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and redirect attempts to generate content that could compromise critical communication infrast...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for ensuring safety an...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, misinformation, compliance wit...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and redirect attempts to generate content that could compromise critical communication infrast...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST cross-reference generated technical specifications against current IEEE, ITU-T, and 3GPP standards databases before...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhanc...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, and eme...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST NOT provide detailed methodologies for signal interception or traffic analysis, automatically reframing such querie...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, safety, and compliance issues in te...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST verify that generated troubleshooting procedures align with standard safety protocols and include appropriate warni...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for addressing telecom...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud detection, public safety, infras...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent technical certifications or compliance documentation and redirect toward leg...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST engage users in clarifying dialogue when requests involve telecommunications content that could affect public safet...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 67/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group addresses several important areas such as VoIP disruption, network documentation, and capa...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST verify that generated troubleshooting procedures align with standard safety protocols and include appropriate warni...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security, safety, and performance optimization in telecommunications.
