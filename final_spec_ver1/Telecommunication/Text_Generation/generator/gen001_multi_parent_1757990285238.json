  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhancing security and compliance in telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of network security, privacy, and performance optimization. However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, and emergency services bypass. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively but lacks explicit coverage of certain edge cases, such as emerging technology risks and specific compliance standards.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 9 and 4, Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests to legitimate topics. They balance security with usability, but the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance. The specs are adaptable but could benefit from more explicit guidelines for different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including safety, security, privacy, and ethical consid...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST verify the operational context and safety requirements through structured questioning before generating content abo...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST rewrite potentially harmful network troubleshooting advice into safe diagnostic approaches that avoid service disru...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for ensuring safety an...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including PII protection, infrastructure security, misi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including network credentials, device serial numbers, customer account identifier...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and redirect attempts to generate content that could compromise critical communication infrast...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for ensuring safety an...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, misinformation, compliance wit...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and redirect attempts to generate content that could compromise critical communication infrast...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST cross-reference generated technical specifications against current IEEE, ITU-T, and 3GPP standards databases before...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraudulent certifications, harmful con...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent technical certifications or compliance documentation and redirect toward leg...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST identify when generated content contains potentially harmful radio frequency exposure calculations and supplement w...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, safety, and compliance issues in te...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect requests for methods to disrupt VoIP services or telecommunications infrastructure and redirect toward servi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST verify that generated troubleshooting procedures align with standard safety protocols and include appropriate warni...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for addressing telecom...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraud detection, public safety, infras...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent technical certifications or compliance documentation and redirect toward leg...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST engage users in clarifying dialogue when requests involve telecommunications content that could affect public safet...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhancing security and compliance in telecommunications.
