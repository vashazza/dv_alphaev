    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on security, safety, and performance optimization in telecommunications. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion and reduce redundancy.",
    "coverage": "The group addresses several important areas such as VoIP disruption, network documentation, and capacity planning. However, there are gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications, which could be better covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of identical or very similar specs (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 10, 13, and 14, SPEC 11, 15, and 16). This repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting potentially harmful requests and maintaining security. However, the presence of redundant specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, and some specs could benefit from more explicit guidance on adaptability to different contexts."
