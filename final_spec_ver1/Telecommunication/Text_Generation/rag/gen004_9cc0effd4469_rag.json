    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication safety and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content and ensuring safety through structured questioning. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 6, SPEC 5 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including network security, emergency services, privacy, and safety compliance. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, with some attention to edge cases like adversarial prompts. However, there could be more explicit coverage of emerging technologies and evolving threats in the telecommunications domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with identical or very similar specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 6, SPEC 5 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into safe, educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of redundant specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality."
