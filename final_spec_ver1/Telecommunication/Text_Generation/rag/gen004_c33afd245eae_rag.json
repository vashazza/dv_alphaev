    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunications safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as redirecting harmful requests towards educational pathways and ensuring user understanding of legal boundaries. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly disrupts the cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including fraudulent certifications, harmful content, infrastructure security, and privacy concerns. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or less common security threats.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 11, and 13 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting harmful requests and engaging users in dialogue. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the implementation may require significant resources, particularly in maintaining interactive dialogues and ensuring compliance with evolving regulations."
