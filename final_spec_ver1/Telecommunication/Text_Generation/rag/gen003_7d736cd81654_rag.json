    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhancing security and compliance in telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of network security, privacy, and performance optimization. However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, and emergency services bypass. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively but lacks explicit coverage of certain edge cases, such as emerging technology risks and specific compliance standards.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 9 and 4, Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests to legitimate topics. They balance security with usability, but the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance. The specs are adaptable but could benefit from more explicit guidelines for different contexts."
