    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at enhancing security and compliance in telecommunications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of network security, data privacy, and service quality. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 4) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including VoIP disruption, unauthorized access, emergency services, and PII protection. While primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in telecommunications to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy with multiple specifications addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 3, SPEC 12, SPEC 15, and SPEC 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests to legitimate topics. However, the implementation might be challenging due to the need for systematic inquiry and verification processes, which could be resource-intensive. Balancing security with usability is achieved, but adaptability to different contexts could be improved."
