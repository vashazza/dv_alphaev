  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication decision support. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on compliance, security, and stakeholder engagement. However, some specs appear to be repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11), which slightly disrupts the cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territories, vendor selection, accessibility, legacy systems, and privacy. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or future regulatory changes.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements being repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11, SPEC 17 and SPEC 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance practicality, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple stakeholders..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including compliance, security, performance, and legal ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): SHOULD detect ambiguous references to \"network performance issues\" and automatically prompt for specific metrics includi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommuni...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international compliance, data protection, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, security, privacy, a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunication ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication decision support.
