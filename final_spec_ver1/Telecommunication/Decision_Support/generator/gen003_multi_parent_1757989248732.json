  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication decision support. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as security, compliance, and ethical considerations. However, some specs appear to be repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territories, vendor selection, accessibility, legacy systems, and privacy. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios well, but there may be gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or specific regional regulations.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11, SPEC 17 and SPEC 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of repeated specs may complicate implementation and maintenance efforts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international compliance, data protection, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international compliance, security, privacy, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international compliance, data privacy, and i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for telecommunication ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for telecommuni...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, addressing various aspects of telecommunication dec...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication decision support.
