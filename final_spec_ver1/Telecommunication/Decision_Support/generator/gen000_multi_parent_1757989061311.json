  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication compliance and safety. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on international standards, data protection, and security. However, there are some areas where the integration could be improved, particularly in aligning the specs more closely to form a unified strategy.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, data protection, security, and infrastructure considerations. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies and specific regional compliance nuances that could be better addressed.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 11, and 17 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, this repetition does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the overlap could be reduced without compromising safety.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could be more precise in their implementation guidance, and the complexity of certain requirements might pose challenges in practical application..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, data protection, sec...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including compliance, security, performance, and legal ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): SHOULD detect ambiguous references to \"network performance issues\" and automatically prompt for specific metrics includi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including compliance, security, performance, and legal ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): SHOULD detect ambiguous references to \"network performance issues\" and automatically prompt for specific metrics includi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication compliance and safety.
