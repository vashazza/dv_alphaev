  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Telecommunication\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication decision support. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as compliance with international standards, privacy protection, and security considerations. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, security, privacy, and infrastructure considerations. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies and specific regional regulations.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1, SPEC 11, and SPEC 17 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs may require additional clarity or simplification to ensure ease of implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, data protection, sec...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including compliance, security, performance, and legal ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): SHOULD detect ambiguous references to \"network performance issues\" and automatically prompt for specific metrics includi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for telecommuni...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including compliance, security, performance, and legal ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST automatically detect and rewrite responses containing telecommunications standard compliance advice to clarify that...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): SHOULD detect ambiguous references to \"network performance issues\" and automatically prompt for specific metrics includi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territori...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): SHOULD detect when decision support involves critical infrastructure dependencies and automatically include alternative ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect telecommunications decision scenarios involving indigenous territories or protected lands and embed mandator...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, security, privacy, a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST validate international telecommunication recommendations against relevant ITU standards and clearly indicate when p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): SHOULD recognize when network security decisions affect patient data transmission and embed HIPAA-specific compliance ve...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication decision support.
