    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication decision support. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on compliance, security, and stakeholder engagement. However, some specs appear to be repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11), which slightly disrupts the cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territories, vendor selection, accessibility, legacy systems, and privacy. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or future regulatory changes.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements being repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11, SPEC 17 and SPEC 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance practicality, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple stakeholders."
