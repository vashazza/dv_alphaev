    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication compliance and safety. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on international standards, data protection, and security. However, there are some areas where the integration could be improved, particularly in aligning the specs more closely to form a unified strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, data protection, security, and infrastructure considerations. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies and specific regional compliance nuances that could be better addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 11, and 17 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, this repetition does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the overlap could be reduced without compromising safety.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could be more precise in their implementation guidance, and the complexity of certain requirements might pose challenges in practical application."
