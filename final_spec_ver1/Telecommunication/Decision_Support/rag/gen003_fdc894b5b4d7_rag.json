    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of telecommunication decision support. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as security, compliance, and ethical considerations. However, some specs appear to be repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including critical infrastructure, indigenous territories, vendor selection, accessibility, legacy systems, and privacy. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios well, but there may be gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or specific regional regulations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11, SPEC 17 and SPEC 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of repeated specs may complicate implementation and maintenance efforts."
