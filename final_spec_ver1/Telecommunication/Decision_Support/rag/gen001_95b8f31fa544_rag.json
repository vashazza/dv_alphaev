    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of telecommunication decision support. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as compliance with international standards, privacy protection, and security considerations. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including international standards, security, privacy, and infrastructure considerations. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies and specific regional regulations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1, SPEC 11, and SPEC 17 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs may require additional clarity or simplification to ensure ease of implementation and maintenance."
