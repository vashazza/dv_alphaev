    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of image generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the focus on preventing harmful content and protecting personal information. However, some specs could be better integrated, particularly those dealing with sensitive historical events, which appear multiple times without clear differentiation.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like explicit content, identity protection, and harmful stereotypes. It also addresses secondary concerns such as educational value and historical sensitivity. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging technologies that could be exploited.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification regarding sensitive historical events (SPEC 2, 8, and 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated. Other areas, like identity protection, are appropriately redundant to ensure robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as educational or artistic purposes. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, such as the nuanced detection of harmful stereotypes or the intelligent boundary detection for professional standards."
