    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant image generation. They address various aspects of content safety, such as privacy, intellectual property, and harmful content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 5 and 8, Specs 9 and 16, Specs 11 and 15), which could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including privacy, intellectual property, harmful content, and misinformation. It addresses both primary and secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging threats in digital content.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by offering alternatives and educational content. However, the presence of repeated specs might complicate maintenance and implementation, and some specs could benefit from more specific guidance on adaptability to different contexts."
