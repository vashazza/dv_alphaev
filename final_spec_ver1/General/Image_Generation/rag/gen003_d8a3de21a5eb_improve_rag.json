    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in image generation. They cover various aspects of ethical and legal considerations, such as identity protection, intellectual property, and sensitive content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including identity theft, intellectual property, historical sensitivity, and more. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there might be some edge cases not fully covered, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging technologies in image generation.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with some being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 14, SPEC 1 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing specific guidance on how to handle various requests. They balance security with usability by offering alternatives or educational content. However, the implementation might be challenging in terms of maintaining consistency across different contexts and ensuring all edge cases are addressed."
