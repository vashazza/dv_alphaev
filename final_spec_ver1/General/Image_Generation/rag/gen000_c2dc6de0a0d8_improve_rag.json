    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant image generation. They address various aspects of content safety, such as privacy, intellectual property, and harmful content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 16, SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly disrupt the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risk areas, including privacy, intellectual property, harmful content, and misinformation. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging threats in image generation.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 16, SPEC 11 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing specific guidance on how to handle various content-related issues. They balance security with usability reasonably well, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, particularly those involving subjective judgment (e.g., determining what constitutes \"potentially inappropriate contexts\" for minors)."
