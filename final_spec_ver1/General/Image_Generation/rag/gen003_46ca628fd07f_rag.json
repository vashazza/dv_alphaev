    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of image generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the focus on avoiding harmful content and protecting personal information. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like explicit content, identity protection, and harmful stereotypes. It also addresses edge cases such as steganography and cybercrime facilitation. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging risks in image generation technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, SPEC 8, and SPEC 15 are identical). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, such as detecting nuanced content like harmful stereotypes or implicit biases."
