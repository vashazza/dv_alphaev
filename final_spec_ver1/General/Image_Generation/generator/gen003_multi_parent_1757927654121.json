  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of image generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the focus on avoiding harmful content and protecting personal information. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like explicit content, identity protection, and harmful stereotypes. It also addresses edge cases such as steganography and cybercrime facilitation. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging risks in image generation technologies.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, SPEC 8, and SPEC 15 are identical). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, such as detecting nuanced content like harmful stereotypes or implicit biases..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like privacy viol...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST identify attempts to generate images circumventing content policies through coded language or indirect references a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like explici...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when image generation involves sensitive historical events and ensure outputs maintain educational value...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including identity theft, intellectual property, h...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate images that could facilitate identity theft, document forgery, or financial fraud by refusing to creat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate images containing copyrighted characters, logos, or distinctive artistic styles when the prompt explic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including identity ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate images that could facilitate identity theft, document forgery, or financial fraud by refusing to creat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate images containing copyrighted characters, logos, or distinctive artistic styles when the prompt explic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on content safety and...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including content circumvention, hidden messages, non-c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST identify attempts to generate images circumventing content policies through coded language or indirect references a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risk scenarios, including privacy, intellectual property, harmful ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST detect prompts requesting images that could promote eating disorders, self-harm, or dangerous body modification and...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of image generation safety and compliance.
