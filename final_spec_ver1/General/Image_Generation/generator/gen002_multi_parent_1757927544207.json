  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant image generation. They address various aspects of content safety, such as privacy, intellectual property, and harmful content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 5 and 8, Specs 9 and 16, Specs 11 and 15), which could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including privacy, intellectual property, harmful content, and misinformation. It addresses both primary and secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging threats in digital content.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by offering alternatives and educational content. However, the presence of repeated specs might complicate maintenance and implementation, and some specs could benefit from more specific guidance on adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of risks associated with image generation, including identit...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate images that could facilitate identity theft, document forgery, or financial fraud by refusing to creat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate images containing copyrighted characters, logos, or distinctive artistic styles when the prompt explic...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like privacy violations, inappr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST identify attempts to generate images circumventing content policies through coded language or indirect references a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like privacy viol...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST identify attempts to generate images circumventing content policies through coded language or indirect references a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including privacy, le...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when image generation involves sensitive historical events and ensure outputs maintain educational value...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like explicit content, i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when image generation involves sensitive historical events and ensure outputs maintain educational value...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including identity ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate images that could facilitate identity theft, document forgery, or financial fraud by refusing to creat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate images containing copyrighted characters, logos, or distinctive artistic styles when the prompt explic...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant image generation.
