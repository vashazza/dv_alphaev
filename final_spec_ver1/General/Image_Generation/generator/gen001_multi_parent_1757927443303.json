Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of image generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the focus on preventing harmful content and protecting personal information. However, some specs could be better integrated, particularly those dealing with sensitive historical events, which appear multiple times without clear differentiation.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like explicit content, identity protection, and harmful stereotypes. It also addresses secondary concerns such as educational value and historical sensitivity. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging technologies that could be exploited.. Target Spec: MUST apply intelligent boundary detection for professional visual standards across different domains...

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the focus on preventing harmful content and protecting personal information. However, some specs could be better integrated, particularly those dealing with sensitive historical events, which appear multiple times without clear differentiation.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like explicit content, identity protection, and harmful stereotypes. It also addresses secondary concerns such as educational value and historical sensitivity. However, there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging technologies that could be exploited.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification regarding sensitive historical events (SPEC 2, 8, and 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated. Other areas, like identity protection, are appropriately redundant to ensure robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as educational or artistic purposes. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, such as the nuanced detection of harmful stereotypes or the intelligent boundary detection for professional standards.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 56) MUST apply intelligent boundary detection for professional visual standards across different domains...\n  - [2] (Score: 65) MUST NOT produce images depicting self-harm, dangerous stunts, or hazardous activities without first...\n  - [3] (Score: 65) MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains. Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Image Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 56/100, Elo: 1520.7):\nMUST apply intelligent boundary detection for professional visual standards across different domains, adapting safety measures to context-specific requirements while maintaining consistent ethical baselines.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1515.6):\nMUST identify prompts requesting sexually explicit content involving minors and automatically substitute with age-appropriate educational or recreational activities while maintaining artistic quality.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1506.9):\nMUST identify requests for generating fake identification documents or official credentials and offer clearly fictional or educational alternatives.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Image Generation safety mechanisms within General domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
