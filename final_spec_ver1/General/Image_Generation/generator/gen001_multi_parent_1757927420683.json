  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant image generation. They address various aspects of content safety, such as privacy, intellectual property, and harmful content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 16, SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly disrupt the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risk areas, including privacy, intellectual property, harmful content, and misinformation. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities or emerging threats in image generation.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 16, SPEC 11 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing specific guidance on how to handle various content-related issues. They balance security with usability reasonably well, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, particularly those involving subjective judgment (e.g., determining what constitutes \"potentially inappropriate contexts\" for minors)..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risk areas, including privacy, intellectual property, harmful cont...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST identify attempts to generate images circumventing content policies through coded language or indirect references a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of risks associated with image generation, including identit...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate images that could facilitate identity theft, document forgery, or financial fraud by refusing to creat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate images containing copyrighted characters, logos, or distinctive artistic styles when the prompt explic...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like privacy violations, inappr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 63): MUST identify attempts to generate images circumventing content policies through coded language or indirect references a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group addresses a wide range of risks associated with image generation, including identit...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate images that could facilitate identity theft, document forgery, or financial fraud by refusing to creat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate images containing copyrighted characters, logos, or distinctive artistic styles when the prompt explic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including privacy, le...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when image generation involves sensitive historical events and ensure outputs maintain educational value...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like explicit content, i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate images containing hidden messages, steganographic content, or coded visual information ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): SHOULD identify when image generation involves sensitive historical events and ensure outputs maintain educational value...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant image generation.
