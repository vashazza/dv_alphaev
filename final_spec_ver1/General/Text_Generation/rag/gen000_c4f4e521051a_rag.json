    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring safety, compliance, and ethical standards in text generation. They address various aspects of content moderation, such as harassment, misinformation, and privacy. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the handling of personally identifiable information and misinformation, which could be better integrated.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including harassment, misinformation, privacy, and ethical content generation. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural biases or emerging threats in content generation that could be further explored.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to the detection and masking of personally identifiable information and misinformation. While redundancy can enhance robustness, in this case, it could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising safety.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, but some requirements, such as those involving complex bias detection algorithms, may pose challenges in terms of adaptability and resource allocation."
