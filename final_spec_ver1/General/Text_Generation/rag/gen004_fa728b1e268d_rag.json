    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in text generation. They address various aspects of content generation, such as privacy, misinformation, and misuse, and there are logical connections between them. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, and misuse, addressing both primary and secondary scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging risks, which could be improved for more comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 11, 18, and 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could benefit from more precise language to enhance clarity and ease of implementation."
