    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in text generation. They address various aspects of security, privacy, and misinformation, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 4, SPEC 14 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, social engineering, and misuse of generated content. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated multiple times (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 4, SPEC 14 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those involving nuanced judgment calls (e.g., detecting potential misuse or controversial topics)."
