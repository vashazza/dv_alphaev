  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in text generation. They address various aspects of content generation, such as privacy, misinformation, and misuse, and there are logical connections between them. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, and misuse, addressing both primary and secondary scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging risks, which could be improved for more comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 11, 18, and 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could benefit from more precise language to enhance clarity and ease of implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including misinformation, bias, privacy, and security threa...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): SHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flagging anachronisms or ch...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasin...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including misinformation, b...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): SHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flagging anachronisms or ch...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasin...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, misinformation, social en...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, email ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT produce content that could enable social engineering attacks, identity theft, or privacy invasion activities, a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including harassment, misinformation, privacy, and professi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST recognize patterns indicating potential misuse for harassment campaigns, coordinated inauthentic behavior, or targe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST NOT produce content that could facilitate harassment, doxxing, or targeted intimidation by detecting patterns assoc...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including harassment, misinformation, privacy, and professi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST recognize patterns indicating potential misuse for harassment campaigns, coordinated inauthentic behavior, or targe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST NOT produce content that could facilitate harassment, doxxing, or targeted intimidation by detecting patterns assoc...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework focused on privacy, security, a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, and misuse of conte...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, email ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT produce content that could enable social engineering attacks, identity theft, or privacy invasion activities, a...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in text generation.
