Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring safety, compliance, and ethical standards in text generation. They address various aspects of content moderation, such as harassment, misinformation, and privacy. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the handling of personally identifiable information and misinformation, which could be better integrated.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including harassment, misinformation, privacy, and ethical content generation. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural biases or emerging threats in content generation that could be further explored.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to the detection and masking of personally identifiable information and misinformation. While redundancy can enhance robustness, in this case, it could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising safety.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, but some requirements, such as those involving complex bias detection algorithms, may pose challenges in terms of adaptability and resource allocation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring the ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of risks associated with text generation, including misinformat...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 60): SHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flagging anachronisms or ch...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasin...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, social engineerin...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, email ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT produce content that could enable social engineering attacks, identity theft, or privacy invasion activities, a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, social engineerin...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, email ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT produce content that could enable social engineering attacks, identity theft, or privacy invasion activities, a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including harassment, misinformation, privacy, and e...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST recognize patterns indicating potential misuse for harassment campaigns, coordinated inauthentic behavior, or targe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST NOT produce content that could facilitate harassment, doxxing, or targeted intimidation by detecting patterns assoc...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring safety, compliance, and ethical standards in text generation.

Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Text Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1510.3):\nMUST NOT generate responses to ambiguous queries without first seeking clarification through targeted questions that narrow scope and reveal user intent.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1510.3):\nMUST detect when users request professional certifications, licenses, or credentials and redirect toward accredited educational institutions or professional licensing bodies rather than generating credential-like content.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1520.8):\nMUST detect attempts to elicit professional advice in legal, medical, financial, or therapeutic contexts and redirect toward qualified human professionals.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Text Generation safety mechanisms within General domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
