Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in text generation. They address various aspects of content generation, such as privacy, misinformation, and misuse, and there are logical connections between them. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, and misuse, addressing both primary and secondary scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging risks, which could be improved for more comprehensive coverage..

They address various aspects of content generation, such as privacy, misinformation, and misuse, and there are logical connections between them. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, misinformation, and misuse, addressing both primary and secondary scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and emerging risks, which could be improved for more comprehensive coverage.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 11, 18, and 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could benefit from more precise language to enhance clarity and ease of implementation.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST verify that generated text maintains appropriate contextual boundaries when discussing sensitiv...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as official guidance in legal, medical, or finan...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST detect when generated text could facilitate dangerous activities including self-harm, violence ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements. Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Text Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 65/100, Elo: 1522.0):\nMUST verify that generated text maintains appropriate contextual boundaries when discussing sensitive topics across different cultural, legal, or social frameworks.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1535.1):\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and identification numbers before generating any response.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 77/100, Elo: 1531.7):\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers in generated text while preserving contextual meaning through generic placeholders.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Text Generation safety mechanisms within General domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
