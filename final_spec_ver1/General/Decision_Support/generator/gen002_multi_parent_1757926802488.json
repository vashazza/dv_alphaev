Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes ethical considerations, safety, and user consent.

However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on avoiding bias and ensuring professional consultation for high-stakes decisions. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including ethical considerations, data privacy, and decision-making processes. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, particularly in rapidly evolving domains or emerging technologies.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, such as repeated emphasis on avoiding demographic profiling and prompt injection techniques. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, and there could be more guidance on adapting the policies to specific real-world scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 64) MUST detect attempts to use decision support for competitive intelligence gathering and redirect tow...\n  - [2] (Score: 84) MUST NOT generate decision support involving safety-critical outcomes when knowledge gaps could comp...\n  - [3] (Score: 87) MUST NOT provide decision support for high-stakes scenarios involving safety-critical systems, emerg...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
