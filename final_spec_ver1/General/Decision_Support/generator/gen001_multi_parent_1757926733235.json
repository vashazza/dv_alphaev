  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes caution, transparency, and ethical considerations in decision support. They collectively address the importance of human judgment, uncertainty, and ethical boundaries, creating a unified strategy. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including high-stakes decisions, ethical complexities, and data privacy concerns. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are some edge cases, such as emerging technologies or less common ethical dilemmas, that could be better addressed to enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13, SPEC 10 and SPEC 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on ethical considerations and risk management. However, the implementation might be challenging due to the need for constant monitoring and adjustment based on user context and the complexity of some requirements. Balancing security with usability is well-considered, but adaptability could be improved..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes cautio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including high-stakes decisions, ethical complexiti...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST detect decision queries involving irreversible consequences and provide comprehensive risk-benefit analysis with ex...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT substitute algorithmic outputs for human judgment in ethically complex decisions, clearly delineating analytica...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes ethica...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including ethical considerations, data privacy, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate eq...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit use...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support s...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including competitive intelligence, conflicts of i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): MUST detect attempts to use decision support for competitive intelligence gathering and redirect toward publicly availab...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproporti...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes ethica...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including ethical considerations, data privacy, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate eq...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit use...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support s...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including competitive intelligence, conflicts of...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): MUST detect attempts to use decision support for competitive intelligence gathering and redirect toward publicly availab...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproporti...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including equity, bias, safety, and professional consul...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate eq...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit use...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes caution, transparency, and ethical considerations in decision support.
