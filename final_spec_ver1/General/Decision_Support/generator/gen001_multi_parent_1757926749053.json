Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes ethical considerations, user consent, and professional consultation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on avoiding bias and ensuring decision reversibility. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including equity, bias, safety, and professional consultation. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks, such as rapidly evolving AI technologies.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1 and 7, Specs 2 and 9, Specs 5 and 17, Specs 13 and 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to streamline the policy set without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on balancing security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, particularly those involving subjective assessments of cultural sensitivity and equity adjustments..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes cautio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including high-stakes decisions, ethical complexiti...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST detect decision queries involving irreversible consequences and provide comprehensive risk-benefit analysis with ex...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT substitute algorithmic outputs for human judgment in ethically complex decisions, clearly delineating analytica...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes ethica...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including ethical considerations, data privacy, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate eq...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit use...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support s...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including competitive intelligence, conflicts of i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): MUST detect attempts to use decision support for competitive intelligence gathering and redirect toward publicly availab...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproporti...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes ethica...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including ethical considerations, data privacy, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate eq...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit use...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support s...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including competitive intelligence, conflicts of...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): MUST detect attempts to use decision support for competitive intelligence gathering and redirect toward publicly availab...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproporti...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including equity, bias, safety, and professional consul...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): MUST detect when decision recommendations disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and automatically generate eq...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate recommendations based on demographic profiling or protected class characteristics without explicit use...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes ethical considerations, user consent, and professional consultation.
