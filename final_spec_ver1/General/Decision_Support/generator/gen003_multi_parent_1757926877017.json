Average group score: 71.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on ethical decision-making, uncertainty management, and privacy protection. However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are present but could be more explicitly defined to form a more coherent strategy.. Coverage: The policy group addresses several critical areas such as ethical decision-making, uncertainty, and privacy.

However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are present but could be more explicitly defined to form a more coherent strategy.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group addresses several critical areas such as ethical decision-making, uncertainty, and privacy. However, there are gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios and some secondary risks, such as the handling of non-personal sensitive data or broader contextual factors influencing decision support.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is significant redundancy with multiple specs repeating the same requirements (e.g., Specs 6, 16, 17; Specs 5, 11, 18, 19; Specs 7, 14, 20). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on ethical considerations and privacy. However, the repetition and lack of consolidation may hinder maintainability. The specs are adaptable but could better balance security with usability by reducing complexity.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, f...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometr...\n  - [3] (Score: 68) MUST detect when decision support requests involve potential conflicts of interest between multiple ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
