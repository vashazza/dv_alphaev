    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes caution, transparency, and ethical considerations in decision support. They collectively address the importance of human judgment, uncertainty, and ethical boundaries, creating a unified strategy. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including high-stakes decisions, ethical complexities, and data privacy concerns. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are some edge cases, such as emerging technologies or less common ethical dilemmas, that could be better addressed to enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13, SPEC 10 and SPEC 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on ethical considerations and risk management. However, the implementation might be challenging due to the need for constant monitoring and adjustment based on user context and the complexity of some requirements. Balancing security with usability is well-considered, but adaptability could be improved."
