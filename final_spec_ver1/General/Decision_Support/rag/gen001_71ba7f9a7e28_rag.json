    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes ethical considerations, user consent, and professional consultation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on avoiding bias and ensuring decision reversibility. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including equity, bias, safety, and professional consultation. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks, such as rapidly evolving AI technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1 and 7, Specs 2 and 9, Specs 5 and 17, Specs 13 and 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to streamline the policy set without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on balancing security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, particularly those involving subjective assessments of cultural sensitivity and equity adjustments."
