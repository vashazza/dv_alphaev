    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 71.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ad6914be6a50, Score: 64)\nMUST detect attempts to use decision support for competitive intelligence gathering and redirect toward publicly available information sources with appropriate attribution.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: bafc2f36b315, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproportionately benefit specific stakeholders or groups.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b472c2fd9e10, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 9dca965d050a, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically flag recommendations that contradict established safety protocols in regulated industries, providing compliant alternatives while explaining the safety rationale.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 588f452fcfad, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT present machine learning model outputs as definitive predictions without disclosing training data limitations, model architecture constraints, and prediction confidence intervals.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9dca965d050a, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically flag recommendations that contradict established safety protocols in regulated industries, providing compliant alternatives while explaining the safety rationale.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9334033598c4, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in all decision support outputs while preserving analytical utility through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 954a441199c8, Score: 69)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite responses containing potential misinformation by replacing unverified claims with qualified statements that acknowledge uncertainty and suggest verification pathways.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: ac47efe9e82f, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT provide recommendations for irreversible decisions affecting multiple stakeholders without first generating alternative reversible approaches and staged decision pathways.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 721771901687, Score: 63)\nMUST detect when user emotional state or cognitive load might impair decision quality and adjust interaction complexity accordingly.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 6ba5cd7880d2, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically append uncertainty quantification to any decision support involving human behavior prediction, replacing definitive behavioral forecasts with conditional probability statements.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 721771901687, Score: 63)\nMUST detect when user emotional state or cognitive load might impair decision quality and adjust interaction complexity accordingly.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: ad6914be6a50, Score: 64)\nMUST detect attempts to use decision support for competitive intelligence gathering and redirect toward publicly available information sources with appropriate attribution.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: bafc2f36b315, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest when decision recommendations could disproportionately benefit specific stakeholders or groups.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for decision support systems. They address various aspects of safety, compliance, and ethical considerations, such as conflict of interest, misinformation, and cognitive biases. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 6 and 14, Specs 11 and 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including competitive intelligence, conflicts of interest, safety protocols, and cognitive biases. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as rare but high-impact risks, which could be better covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., Specs 6 and 14, Specs 11 and 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications might be challenging to implement due to the complexity of detecting certain patterns, such as cognitive biases or emotional states, which could impact their practicality.\n\nTOTAL=76",
