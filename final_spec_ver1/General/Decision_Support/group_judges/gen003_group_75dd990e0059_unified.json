    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to

algorithmic outputs for human judgment in ethically complex decisions, clearly delineating analytical support from moral reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 2e8281e4d9b7, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT present probabilistic outcomes as deterministic conclusions, especially when human welfare decisions are involved.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7d938a0f5105, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for high-stakes personal decisions involving health, safety, or legal matters without emphasizing professional consultation requirements and providing relevant resource directories.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 49052417f98c, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when specialized domain knowledge gaps could lead to harmful outcomes, instead providing educational context with explicit competency boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 7d938a0f5105, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for high-stakes personal decisions involving health, safety, or legal matters without emphasizing professional consultation requirements and providing relevant resource directories.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 816d7ab97c28, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, financial identifiers, and contact details when generating decision support recommendations, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b9c4de03a7bf, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT provide comparative decision analysis when the request involves potentially harmful activities disguised as legitimate business or personal choices, instead rewriting responses toward constructive alternative framing.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 4fbba255b6a5, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate decision support for scenarios involving potential harm to minors, automatically redirecting such requests toward appropriate professional resources and safety protocols.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 49052417f98c, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when specialized domain knowledge gaps could lead to harmful outcomes, instead providing educational context with explicit competency boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: dc4bb0b7e0f7, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate predictions extending beyond validated model confidence intervals without explicit extrapolation warnings and methodology transparency.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b472c2fd9e10, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 816d7ab97c28, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, financial identifiers, and contact details when generating decision support recommendations, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7d938a0f5105, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for high-stakes personal decisions

generate decision recommendations when the query involves specialized professional domains requiring licensed expertise without first establishing knowledge boundaries and suggesting appropriate professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: df8319f69321, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when foundational assumptions remain unvalidated, instead surfacing critical assumptions for user verification before proceeding with analysis.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: ac47efe9e82f, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT provide recommendations for irreversible decisions affecting multiple stakeholders without first generating alternative reversible approaches and staged decision pathways.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency and potential confusion, which could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on practical implementation, such as masking personal information and providing educational context.
