    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to

decision recommendations when confidence levels fall below established thresholds without first transforming the response into exploratory guidance that emphasizes uncertainty and alternative investigation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9dca965d050a, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically flag recommendations that contradict established safety protocols in regulated industries, providing compliant alternatives while explaining the safety rationale.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 588f452fcfad, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT present machine learning model outputs as definitive predictions without disclosing training data limitations, model architecture constraints, and prediction confidence intervals.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 9dca965d050a, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically flag recommendations that contradict established safety protocols in regulated industries, providing compliant alternatives while explaining the safety rationale.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 9334033598c4, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in all decision support outputs while preserving analytical utility through anonymization techniques.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fffd6744040b, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when the query involves specialized professional domains requiring licensed expertise without first establishing knowledge boundaries and suggesting appropriate professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 954a441199c8, Score: 69)\nSHOULD automatically rewrite responses containing potential misinformation by replacing unverified claims with qualified statements that acknowledge uncertainty and suggest verification pathways.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ac47efe9e82f, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT provide recommendations for irreversible decisions affecting multiple stakeholders without first generating alternative reversible approaches and staged decision pathways.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 4fbba255b6a5, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate decision support for scenarios involving potential harm to minors, automatically redirecting such requests toward appropriate professional resources and safety protocols.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: df8319f69321, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when foundational assumptions remain unvalidated, instead surfacing critical assumptions for user verification before proceeding with analysis.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: df8319f69321, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when foundational assumptions remain unvalidated, instead surfacing critical assumptions for user verification before proceeding with analysis.\n\n[SPEC

resources and safety protocols.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 6ba5cd7880d2, Score: 70)\nMUST automatically append uncertainty quantification to any decision support involving human behavior prediction, replacing definitive behavioral forecasts with conditional probability statements.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: fffd6744040b, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when the query involves specialized professional domains requiring licensed expertise without first establishing knowledge boundaries and suggesting appropriate professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: df8319f69321,

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety, compliance, and ethical considerations in decision support systems. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11), which could indicate a lack of coordination in the policy set. Despite this, the specs collectively aim to ensure responsible AI usage, which contributes to their overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including safety protocols, data privacy, professional expertise, and decision-making under uncertainty. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks in AI decision support. Some areas, such as the handling of misinformation and irreversible decisions, are well-covered, but others, like evolving regulatory landscapes, could be more explicitly addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on safety and compliance. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling uncertainty and ensuring professional consultation. However, the repetition and overlap in some specs could complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality.\n\nTOTAL=73",
