    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of analytical reasoning and its potential misuse. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting harmful decision-making and providing alternative frameworks (SPEC 4, SPEC 13), and ensuring statistical limitations are communicated (SPEC 3, SPEC 10). However, there are a few repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including societal inequalities (SPEC 2), privacy concerns (SPEC 9, SPEC 11), and the prevention of harmful content (SPEC 7, SPEC 14, SPEC 15). It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks in analytical reasoning.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12, SPEC 4 and SPEC 13), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements, such as those involving complex ethical safeguards (SPEC 17), may be challenging to implement consistently in real-world scenarios without additional guidance."
