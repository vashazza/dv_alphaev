    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, bias mitigation, and harm prevention. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as reframing harmful requests and ensuring evidence-based analysis. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly disrupts cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical reasoning. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks in AI ethics.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is sometimes necessary for critical safety, the repetition here seems unnecessary.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs might require more detailed guidance for implementation, particularly in complex scenarios."
