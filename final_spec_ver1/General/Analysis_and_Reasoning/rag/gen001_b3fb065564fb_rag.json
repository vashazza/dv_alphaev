    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and safe use of analytical capabilities. They collectively address issues like discrimination, privacy, and manipulation, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, discrimination, manipulation, and ethical use of reasoning capabilities. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced ethical dilemmas or emerging technologies that could impact compliance.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 13). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios. The presence of repeated specs could also complicate maintenance."
