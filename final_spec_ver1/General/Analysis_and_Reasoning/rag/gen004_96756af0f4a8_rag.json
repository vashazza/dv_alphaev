    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, bias mitigation, and harm prevention. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as reframing harmful requests and ensuring inclusive problem-solving. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and harm prevention. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and specific compliance areas, such as data security beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, such as detecting emotional undertones or indirect inference patterns."
