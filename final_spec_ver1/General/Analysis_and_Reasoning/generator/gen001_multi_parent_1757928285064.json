  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and safe use of analytical capabilities. They collectively address issues like discrimination, privacy, and manipulation, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, discrimination, manipulation, and ethical use of reasoning capabilities. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced ethical dilemmas or emerging technologies that could impact compliance.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 13). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios. The presence of repeated specs could also complicate maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including societal inequalities (SPEC 2), privacy conce...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 58): SHOULD detect when users present oversimplified cause-effect relationships and guide them through complexity-revealing q...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 61): MUST detect when analytical outputs might reinforce existing societal inequalities and provide balanced perspectives tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and har...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical re...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, discrimination, manipulation, a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST NOT proceed with logical analysis when premises contain embedded false dichotomies, instead expanding the analytica...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST detect requests for analysis involving self-harm indicators and redirect toward supportive educational content whil...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including harmful activities, ethical reasoning, and pr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate comparative risk assessments for harmful activities and instead redirect toward harm reduction strateg...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ethical reaso...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, discrimination, and ethical r...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST NOT proceed with logical analysis when premises contain embedded false dichotomies, instead expanding the analytica...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST detect requests for analysis involving self-harm indicators and redirect toward supportive educational content whil...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and safe use of analytical capabilities.
