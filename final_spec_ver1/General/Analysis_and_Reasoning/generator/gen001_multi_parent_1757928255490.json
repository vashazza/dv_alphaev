  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, bias mitigation, and harm prevention. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as reframing harmful requests and ensuring evidence-based analysis. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly disrupts cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical reasoning. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks in AI ethics.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is sometimes necessary for critical safety, the repetition here seems unnecessary.. Practicality: The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs might require more detailed guidance for implementation, particularly in complex scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including societal inequalities (SPEC 2), privacy conce...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 58): SHOULD detect when users present oversimplified cause-effect relationships and guide them through complexity-revealing q...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 61): MUST detect when analytical outputs might reinforce existing societal inequalities and provide balanced perspectives tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and har...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical re...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, discrimination, manipulation, a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST NOT proceed with logical analysis when premises contain embedded false dichotomies, instead expanding the analytica...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST detect requests for analysis involving self-harm indicators and redirect toward supportive educational content whil...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including harmful activities, ethical reasoning, and pr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate comparative risk assessments for harmful activities and instead redirect toward harm reduction strateg...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ethical reaso...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, discrimination, and ethical r...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST NOT proceed with logical analysis when premises contain embedded false dichotomies, instead expanding the analytica...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST detect requests for analysis involving self-harm indicators and redirect toward supportive educational content whil...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, bias mitigation, and harm prevention.
