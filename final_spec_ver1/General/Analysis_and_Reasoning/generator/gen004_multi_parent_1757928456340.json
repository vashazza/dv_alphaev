  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, bias mitigation, and harm prevention. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as reframing harmful requests and ensuring inclusive problem-solving. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and harm prevention. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and specific compliance areas, such as data security beyond PII masking.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 9 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, such as detecting emotional undertones or indirect inference patterns..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical re...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including harmful activities, privacy concerns, and eth...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate comparative risk assessments for harmful activities and instead redirect toward harm reduction strateg...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including the prevention of misinformation, protec...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 58): SHOULD detect when users present oversimplified cause-effect relationships and guide them through complexity-revealing q...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 61): MUST detect when analytical outputs might reinforce existing societal inequalities and provide balanced perspectives tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 69/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on preventing harm, bias, and privacy viol...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, discrimination, privacy, and harm ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ethical rea...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data privacy, ethical reasoning, and p...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and id...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST recognize queries seeking analysis to circumvent professional oversight mechanisms and redirect toward appropriate ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework focused on preventing...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, discrimination, privacy, and har...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, bias mitigation, and harm prevention.
