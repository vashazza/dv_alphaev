Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of analytical reasoning and its potential misuse. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting harmful decision-making and providing alternative frameworks (SPEC 4, SPEC 13), and ensuring statistical limitations are communicated (SPEC 3, SPEC 10). However, there are a few repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including societal inequalities (SPEC 2), privacy concerns (SPEC 9, SPEC 11), and the prevention of harmful content (SPEC 7, SPEC 14, SPEC 15). It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks in analytical reasoning.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12, SPEC 4 and SPEC 13), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements, such as those involving complex ethical safeguards (SPEC 17), may be challenging to implement consistently in real-world scenarios without additional guidance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including societal inequalities (SPEC 2), privacy conce...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 58): SHOULD detect when users present oversimplified cause-effect relationships and guide them through complexity-revealing q...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 61): MUST detect when analytical outputs might reinforce existing societal inequalities and provide balanced perspectives tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and har...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical re...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): SHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement res...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 60): SHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, n...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, discrimination, manipulation, a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST NOT proceed with logical analysis when premises contain embedded false dichotomies, instead expanding the analytica...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST detect requests for analysis involving self-harm indicators and redirect toward supportive educational content whil...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including harmful activities, ethical reasoning, and pr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate comparative risk assessments for harmful activities and instead redirect toward harm reduction strateg...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ethical reaso...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, discrimination, and ethical r...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 54): MUST NOT proceed with logical analysis when premises contain embedded false dichotomies, instead expanding the analytica...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST detect requests for analysis involving self-harm indicators and redirect toward supportive educational content whil...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of analytical reasoning and its potential misuse.
