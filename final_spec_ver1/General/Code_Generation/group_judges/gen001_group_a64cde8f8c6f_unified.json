    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 63.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 0a0b05fb60b3, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and least privilege principles before output delivery.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8cebfa45323a, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user engagement measurement alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0a0b05fb60b3, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and least privilege principles before output delivery.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d0e38509b20e, Score: 62)\nMUST NOT produce code containing known vulnerable dependencies or deprecated security functions without explicit migration guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 5c85eea3fc7e, Score: 77)\nMUST initiate targeted clarification dialogue when code generation requests lack essential context about data types, expected input ranges, or error handling requirements, asking specific questions to prevent runtime failures.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: db8cd83eadaa, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that generated concurrent or parallel processing code includes proper synchronization mechanisms and race condition prevention to avoid data corruption scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b341f06fb75a, Score: 75)\nMUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward compliant financial data analysis examples with appropriate regulatory disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7badd350b0c0, Score: 73)\nMUST transform code generation requests that could enable privilege escalation into properly scoped alternatives with least-privilege principles and access control validation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 7badd350b0c0, Score: 73)\nMUST transform code generation requests that could enable privilege escalation into properly scoped alternatives with least-privilege principles and access control validation.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: ecb4ce3719f5, Score: 67)\nMUST detect when code generation requests could impact accessibility, internationalization, or cross-platform compatibility, proactively offering inclusive design alternatives and compatibility considerations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d8535a1b497e, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that generated cryptographic code avoids deprecated algorithms, weak key generation, and improper random number usage while suggesting established cryptographic libraries.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 1d9e13353c0b, Score: 60)\nSHOULD recognize when generated database queries could expose sensitive information through timing attacks or inference and suggest privacy-preserving query modifications.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 1d9e13353c0b, Score: 60)\nSHOULD recognize when generated database queries could expose sensitive information through timing attacks or inference and suggest privacy-preserving query modifications.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1d9e13353c0b, Score: 60)\nSHOULD recognize when generated database queries could expose sensitive information through timing attacks or inference and suggest privacy-preserving query modifications.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1d9e13353c0b, Score: 60)\nSHOULD recognize when generated database queries could expose sensitive information through timing attacks or inference and suggest privacy-preserving query modifications.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d0e38509b20e, Score: 62)\nMUST NOT produce code containing known vulnerable dependencies or deprecated security functions without explicit migration guidance.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: ecb4ce3719f5, Score: 67)\nMUST detect when code generation requests could impact accessibility, internationalization, or cross-platform compatibility, proactively offering inclusive design alternatives and compatibility considerations.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: c634d183afe1, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and API keys when they appear in generated code comments, variable names, or hardcoded values.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
