  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for secure and ethical code generation. They cover various aspects of security, privacy, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between requirements such as secure coding practices, privacy compliance, and ethical disclaimers. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including secure coding, privacy, ethical considerations, and prevention of malicious activities. Primary and secondary scenarios are well-addressed, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as specific industry regulations or emerging threats that could be better covered.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, but some requirements could be more adaptable to different contexts. For instance, more guidance on how to handle specific industry standards or evolving threats would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and complia...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without e...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate code generation requests against known malicious patterns and transform them into educational examples tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and complia...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without e...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate code generation requests against known malicious patterns and transform them into educational examples tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 69/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework focused on secure and complian...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of security and compliance issues, including secure coding pract...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including secure coding, privacy, ethical considera...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for secure and compliant code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses a wide range of scenarios, including database security, web application vul...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 76): MUST verify that database interaction code includes parameterized queries, input sanitization, and SQL injection prevent...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST verify that generated web application code includes CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and secure header configuratio...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for secure and ethical code generation.
