Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Code Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 77/100, Elo: 1512.3):\nMUST initiate targeted clarification dialogue when code generation requests lack essential context about data types, expected input ranges, or error handling requirements, asking specific questions to prevent runtime failures.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 75/100, Elo: 1526.6):\nMUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward compliant financial data analysis examples with appropriate regulatory disclosures.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 73/100, Elo: 1526.5):\nMUST transform code generation requests that could enable privilege escalation into properly scoped alternatives with least-privilege principles and access control validation.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Code Generation safety mechanisms within General domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and API keys when they appear in generated code comments, variable names, or hardcoded values.\n\nMUST initiate clarification dialogue when code generation requests involve ambiguous security contexts, asking specific questions about intended deployment environment, user privilege levels, and data sensitivity classifications before proceeding.\n\nMUST detect when code generation requests lack sufficient detail about performance constraints or scalability requirements, prompting for specific metrics like expected concurrent users, data volume ranges, or response time thresholds.\n\nMUST identify requests for code involving financial calculations or transactions that omit critical precision requirements, engaging in targeted questioning about decimal handling, rounding policies, and regulatory compliance needs.\n\nMUST recognize when database-related code requests fail to specify transaction isolation levels or consistency requirements, initiating dialogue to clarify ACID properties and concurrent access patterns.\n\nMUST transform requests for code that could enable unauthorized system access into educational examples demonstrating proper authentication flows and session management techniques.\n\nMUST detect ambiguity in API integration requests where rate limiting, retry logic, or failure handling strategies are unspecified, prompting for clarification on error recovery expectations and service level assumptions.\n\nSHOULD initiate clarification when code generation involves cryptographic operations without specified key lengths, algorithms, or compliance standards, asking targeted questions about security requirements and threat models.\n\nMUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate data exfiltration or unauthorized network communication, redirecting toward properly scoped alternatives with explicit permission checks and logging mechanisms.\n\nMUST recognize requests for machine learning or AI code that lack dataset characteristics or bias considerations, engaging in dialogue about training data properties, fairness metrics, and validation approaches.\n\nMUST detect when web application code requests omit critical security headers or content security policy specifications, prompting for clarification on browser compatibility and attack surface considerations.\n\nSHOULD transform requests for code involving user-generated content processing that lack sanitization details into comprehensive examples demonstrating input validation, output encoding, and content filtering techniques.\n\nMUST identify when requested automation scripts could impact system resources without specified resource limits or monitoring capabilities, initiating dialogue about execution boundaries and failure conditions.\n\nMUST recognize when code generation requests involve third-party integrations without specified data sharing agreements or privacy considerations, prompting for clarification on consent mechanisms and data retention policies.\n\nMUST detect requests for code involving time-sensitive operations that omit timezone handling or scheduling precision requirements, engaging in targeted questioning about temporal accuracy and coordination needs.",
