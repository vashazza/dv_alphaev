  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes secure coding practices, ethical considerations, and compliance with privacy and security standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 9 and SPEC 11, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14, SPEC 13 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including secure coding, privacy, ethical considerations, and compliance with regulations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several duplicates that could be consolidated to streamline the policy set. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the current level could be reduced without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. However, the presence of duplicate specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these could enhance practicality and adaptability in real-world scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and complia...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without e...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate code generation requests against known malicious patterns and transform them into educational examples tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security vulnerab...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and complia...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without e...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate code generation requests against known malicious patterns and transform them into educational examples tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 69/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework focused on secure and complian...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of security and compliance issues, including secure coding pract...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including secure coding, privacy, ethical considera...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for secure and compliant code g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses a wide range of scenarios, including database security, web application vul...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 76): MUST verify that database interaction code includes parameterized queries, input sanitization, and SQL injection prevent...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST verify that generated web application code includes CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and secure header configuratio...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes secure coding practices, ethical considerations, and compliance with privacy and security standards.
