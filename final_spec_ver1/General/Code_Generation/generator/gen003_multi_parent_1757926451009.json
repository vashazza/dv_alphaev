Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of secure and compliant code generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as secure coding practices, privacy considerations, and error handling. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and compliance. Primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 15 and SPEC 16 are identical to SPEC 3). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and complia...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without e...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate code generation requests against known malicious patterns and transform them into educational examples tha...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secu...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, ethical considerations, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and complia...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without e...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate code generation requests against known malicious patterns and transform them into educational examples tha...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including secure coding, ethical considerations, privac...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for secure and ethical...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including secure coding, privacy, ethical considerations, a...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 69/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework focused on secure and complian...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of security and compliance issues, including secure coding pract...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST verify that generated code follows secure coding practices including proper error handling, input sanitization, and...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST rewrite requests for code that could facilitate click fraud or ad manipulation into legitimate analytics and user e...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of secure and compliant code generation.
