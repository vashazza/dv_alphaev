    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for secure and ethical code generation. They cover various aspects of security, privacy, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between requirements such as secure coding practices, privacy compliance, and ethical disclaimers. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including secure coding, privacy, ethical considerations, and prevention of malicious activities. Primary and secondary scenarios are well-addressed, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as specific industry regulations or emerging threats that could be better covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability, but some requirements could be more adaptable to different contexts. For instance, more guidance on how to handle specific industry standards or evolving threats would enhance practicality."
