    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of secure code generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as secure coding practices, privacy considerations, and ethical guidelines. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including secure coding practices, ethical considerations, privacy, and security vulnerabilities. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication in the specifications, such as repeated requirements for secure coding practices and privilege escalation. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repeated specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of repeated specs may complicate maintenance and implementation efforts."
