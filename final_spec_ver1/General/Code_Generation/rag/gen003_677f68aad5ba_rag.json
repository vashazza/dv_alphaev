    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of secure and compliant code generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as secure coding practices, privacy considerations, and error handling. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, accessibility, and compliance. Primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 15 and SPEC 16 are identical to SPEC 3). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could benefit from more detailed implementation guidance to enhance practicality."
