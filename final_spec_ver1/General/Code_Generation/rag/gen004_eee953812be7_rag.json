    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes secure coding practices, ethical considerations, and compliance with privacy and security standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 9 and SPEC 11, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14, SPEC 13 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a wide range of scenarios, including secure coding, privacy, ethical considerations, and compliance with regulations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several duplicates that could be consolidated to streamline the policy set. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the current level could be reduced without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. However, the presence of duplicate specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these could enhance practicality and adaptability in real-world scenarios."
