    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on secure and ethical code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as secure coding practices, privacy compliance, and ethical considerations. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including security, privacy, ethical considerations, and compliance with regulations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated exactly (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of repeated specs suggests potential challenges in maintaining the policy set, which slightly impacts practicality."
