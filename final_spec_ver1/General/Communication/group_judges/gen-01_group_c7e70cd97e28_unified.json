    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 18 specs, Avg Score: 67.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 587f283de7d5, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when summarization requests involve potentially biased source material and include perspective diversity acknowledgments in condensed outputs.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 23ef0e1b97f9, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when communication involves minors based on contextual cues and automatically apply enhanced privacy protections and age-appropriate content filtering.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: fa140c3b9de0, Score: 68)\nMUST apply domain-specific fact-checking protocols that adapt verification depth based on the potential harm level of inaccurate information in the given context.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 74286d59b375, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when communication requests could facilitate deception, impersonation, or misrepresentation and rewrite responses to emphasize transparency and authentic representation.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: e847e7551c01, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate responses to requests involving personal relationship advice, mental health concerns, or emotional distress without first confirming the conversational boundaries and suggesting professional resources when appropriate.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fd87f4263a86, Score: 62)\nMUST apply graduated uncertainty disclosure based on information recency, with stronger disclaimers for time-sensitive topics where knowledge cutoffs create accuracy risks.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 22899e20b09e, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when user queries contain implicit assumptions that may lead to harmful outcomes and explicitly surface these assumptions for user confirmation before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 587f283de7d5, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when summarization requests involve potentially biased source material and include perspective diversity acknowledgments in condensed outputs.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b231d55454c4, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and financial account details before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 22899e20b09e, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when user queries contain implicit assumptions that may lead to harmful outcomes and explicitly surface these assumptions for user confirmation before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: cd7f5aea8fc9, Score: 64)\nMUST NOT generate responses to translation requests involving hate speech, discriminatory language, or harmful content without first neutralizing the problematic elements while preserving communicative intent.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 10c1053bd2d4, Score: 71)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit responses that bypass safety constraints through roleplay, hypothetical scenarios, or indirect phrasing and redirect toward constructive alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 75e3896edb72, Score: 64)\nMUST detect potential ambiguity in pronouns, references, or context dependencies and seek clarification before generating substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0dcd70db9003, Score: 67)\nMUST recognize when translation requests involve idioms, cultural expressions, or context-dependent meanings and provide multiple interpretation options with cultural context explanations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 587f283de7d5, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when summarization requests involve potentially biased source material and include perspective diversity acknowledgments in condensed outputs.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 3e5024012415, Score: 66)\nMUST verify factual consistency across multi-part responses and flag internal contradictions before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 39b774662323, Score: 64)\nMUST apply enhanced scrutiny to responses involving vulnerable populations including minors, elderly, or individuals in crisis situations.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: f1da2c22543c, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize temporal context confusion in user queries and clarify whether requests concern past, present, or hypothetical future scenarios before responding.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of communication safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy protection, bias acknowledgment, and factual accuracy. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion, and there are a few instances of repeated specs that could be consolidated for improved unity.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, bias, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and specific domain risks. Some areas, like emotional distress and cultural nuances, are well-covered, but others, such as emerging technologies or specific legal compliance, might need more attention.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 8, and 15 are identical, as are SPEC 7 and 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to streamline the policy set. The group maintains robustness but could be more efficient.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts. The specs could benefit from more detailed guidance on adaptability and maintenance in diverse environments.\n\nTOTAL=75",
