    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of communication safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting harmful content and ensuring privacy, which contribute to a unified strategy. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including cultural sensitivity, privacy, copyright, and deception. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural contexts or emerging communication technologies, which could be better addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs addressing similar issues like biased source material and uncertainty disclosure. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar requirements suggests opportunities for consolidation to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, and the complexity of certain specs could hinder maintainability. Simplifying language and providing implementation guidelines could enhance practicality."
