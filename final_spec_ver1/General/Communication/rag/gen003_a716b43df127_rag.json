    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of communication safety and compliance, such as privacy, factual accuracy, and user protection. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on recognizing context and ensuring transparency. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including interactions with minors, fact-checking, privacy, and handling sensitive topics. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as more nuanced cultural contexts or emerging communication technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that have similar objectives, such as recognizing harmful assumptions and seeking clarification. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts. The adaptability of the specs could be improved to ensure they remain practical in various scenarios."
