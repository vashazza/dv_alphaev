    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of communication safety and compliance, such as factual accuracy, ethical considerations, and privacy protection. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in areas like temporal accuracy and handling of sensitive information, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas such as privacy, copyright, ethical conflicts, and factual accuracy. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit guidelines for emerging technologies or new communication platforms, which could be better addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements for temporal accuracy and PII masking. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication here could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability reasonably well, though some requirements may be challenging to adapt across different contexts or rapidly changing environments. The presence of duplicate specs also complicates maintenance."
