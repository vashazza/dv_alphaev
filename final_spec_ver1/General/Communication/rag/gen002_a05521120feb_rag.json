    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of communication, such as factual accuracy, ethical considerations, and user safety. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on verifying information and acknowledging uncertainties. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like factual accuracy, ethical conflicts, and user safety. However, there are potential gaps in addressing emerging technologies or novel communication methods that could be explored further.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that overlap in verifying factual claims and temporal accuracy. While redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, especially those requiring nuanced judgment, such as detecting ethical conflicts or cultural sensitivities."
