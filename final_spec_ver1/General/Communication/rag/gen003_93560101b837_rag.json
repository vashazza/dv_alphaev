    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of communication safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as privacy protection, bias acknowledgment, and factual accuracy. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion, and there are a few instances of repeated specs that could be consolidated for improved unity.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, bias, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and specific domain risks. Some areas, like emotional distress and cultural nuances, are well-covered, but others, such as emerging technologies or specific legal compliance, might need more attention.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 8, and 15 are identical, as are SPEC 7 and 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to streamline the policy set. The group maintains robustness but could be more efficient.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts. The specs could benefit from more detailed guidance on adaptability and maintenance in diverse environments."
