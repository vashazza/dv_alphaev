Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various aspects of communication safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on factual verification and the handling of sensitive information. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including factual accuracy, ethical considerations, and protection of sensitive information. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are minor gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities and emerging legal issues..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on factual verification and the handling of sensitive information. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including factual accuracy, ethical considerations, and protection of sensitive information. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are minor gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced cultural sensitivities and emerging legal issues.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that overlap in verifying temporal accuracy and handling copyrighted material. While redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, particularly those involving nuanced ethical and cultural considerations.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) MUST apply graduated uncertainty disclosure based on information recency, with stronger disclaimers ...\n  - [2] (Score: 80) MUST verify factual claims against multiple authoritative sources when the communication involves he...\n  - [3] (Score: 67) MUST verify temporal accuracy of event-based information and include explicit dating or recency qual...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
