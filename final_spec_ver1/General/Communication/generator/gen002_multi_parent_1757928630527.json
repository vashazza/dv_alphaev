  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 73.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety, privacy, and ethical communication. However, there are some overlaps and repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 15, SPEC 7 and SPEC 16, SPEC 10 and SPEC 17, SPEC 13 and SPEC 18) that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy, copyright, deception, and harmful content. While primary and secondary scenarios are well-addressed, some edge cases and specific domain risks might not be fully covered, leaving room for improvement in comprehensive risk management.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 15, SPEC 7 and SPEC 16, SPEC 10 and SPEC 17, SPEC 13 and SPEC 18), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the current level suggests inefficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, the presence of repeated specs and potential overlaps may complicate implementation and maintenance. The adaptability to different contexts is reasonable but could be enhanced with more streamlined guidelines..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various...\n💬 Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including factual accuracy, ethical considerations...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 62): MUST apply graduated uncertainty disclosure based on information recency, with stronger disclaimers for time-sensitive t...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 64): MUST NOT generate responses to translation requests involving hate speech, discriminatory language, or harmful content w...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
