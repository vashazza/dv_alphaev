    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in multimodal tasks. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting and masking PII, handling adversarial prompts, and ensuring consistency across modalities. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which could indicate a lack of unique contributions to the overall strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including prompt injection, PII masking, adversarial patterns, and multimodal consistency. Primary and secondary risks are well-addressed, but there could be more focus on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in multimodal environments to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications on PII masking (Specs 3, 5, 9, 14, 15, 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by asking disambiguating questions and providing explanations for technical constraints. However, the repeated specs could complicate maintenance and implementation, slightly reducing practicality."
