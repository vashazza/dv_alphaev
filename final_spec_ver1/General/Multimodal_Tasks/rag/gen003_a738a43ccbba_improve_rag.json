    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal content processing, such as safety, privacy, and authenticity. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 3, SPEC 13 and SPEC 4), which could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including copyright issues, dual-use applications, PII protection, and bias amplification. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific guidelines for emerging technologies or edge-case scenarios that might not be fully addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications addressing similar issues (e.g., PII masking in SPEC 5, SPEC 8, and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and compliance. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all contexts, particularly those involving complex multimodal analysis and bias detection."
