    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on safety and compliance in multimodal tasks. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting and neutralizing threats, masking PII, and ensuring consistency across modalities. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including prompt injection, impersonation, PII protection, and adversarial patterns. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as nuanced contextual misunderstandings or emerging threat vectors not explicitly covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 6), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on safety. They balance security with usability, but the complexity of some specifications might pose challenges in real-world implementation, particularly in dynamically changing environments. Adaptability is present but could be enhanced for diverse contexts."
