    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of safety and compliance, such as user intent preservation, prompt injection detection, and PII masking. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with PII masking, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like prompt injection, impersonation, and multimodal safety. However, there could be more explicit coverage of certain edge cases and emerging threats in the multimodal domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications for PII masking (SPEC 4, SPEC 6, and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, the presence of redundant specs and the need for clarification in some areas may pose challenges for real-world implementation and maintenance."
