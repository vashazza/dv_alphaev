    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal content generation, such as safety, privacy, and authenticity. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, safety verification, and bias mitigation. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios, such as more nuanced dual-use applications and specific fair use clarifications.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13, SPEC 16 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some requirements, such as those involving technical constraints, may need more detailed guidance for implementation across different contexts."
