    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal content verification, safety, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as authenticity verification, misinformation detection, and content rewriting. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including deepfake detection, misinformation, cultural context mismatches, and PII protection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats in the multimodal domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are nearly identical (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 2, SPEC 8 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all contexts, particularly those requiring advanced detection and rewriting capabilities."
