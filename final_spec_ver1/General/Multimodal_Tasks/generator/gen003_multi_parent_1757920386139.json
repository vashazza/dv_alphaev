Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal content safety, such as detecting malicious content, verifying authenticity, and ensuring user safety. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on detecting synthetic content and maintaining safety across modalities. However, there are minor overlaps and potential conflicts, such as the repeated specification regarding self-harm indicators (SPEC 14 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like malicious content and secondary issues like user intent verification. It also addresses edge cases such as coordinated manipulation campaigns and self-harm indicators. However, there might be gaps in addressing emerging threats or specific domain nuances, which could be explored further to enhance coverage.. Redundancy: While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as the repeated self-harm indicator specification (SPEC 14 and SPEC 16). Some specifications could be consolidated to streamline the policy set without losing critical safety measures. Overall, the redundancy is moderate but could be optimized further.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing mechanisms like content warnings and clarifying questions. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all modalities, and adaptability to different contexts could be improved..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
