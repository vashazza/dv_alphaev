  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of multimodal content safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting malicious content, verifying authenticity, and ensuring user safety. However, there is some overlap in the focus on synthetic content and manipulation, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like malicious content and privacy concerns, as well as secondary issues like coordinated manipulation and self-harm indicators. While it addresses many critical areas, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing synthetic content and manipulation (e.g., SPEC 4, SPEC 6, SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the overlap here suggests potential for consolidation to improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing mechanisms like content warnings and clarifying questions. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all modalities, and adaptability to different contexts could be improved..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
