    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 71.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8949bb024ddd, Score: 60)\nMUST NOT process multimodal content containing potential copyright violations without appropriate fair use assessment and attribution verification.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ae2752d572bc, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate responses to requests where clarifying questions reveal potential dual-use applications without providing safer alternative approaches that address legitimate underlying needs.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 4b2a674d6aa6, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT complete responses when multimodal analysis detects coordinated inauthentic behavior patterns designed to manipulate output generation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 8102248f85e5, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate responses to queries where modal processing limitations prevent adequate safety verification, instead explaining the specific technical constraints encountered.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a2b81ea421d8, Score: 76)\nMUST apply content warnings uniformly across all modalities when any component triggers safety thresholds, ensuring no modality bypasses established protections.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 50f060cf4807, Score: 71)\nMUST verify consistency between textual claims and visual evidence when processing multimodal inputs, flagging discrepancies with confidence scores before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3224c251582c, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including biometric identifiers, financial data, and location coordinates across all modalities before generating any response content.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1ef1170686eb, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate synthetic multimodal content that could be mistaken for authentic documentation, evidence, or professional materials without prominent synthetic content labeling.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4b2a674d6aa6, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT complete responses when multimodal analysis detects coordinated inauthentic behavior patterns designed to manipulate output generation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 7e5ad9431325, Score: 71)\nMUST initiate clarifying questions when multimodal inputs contain ambiguous cross-references between visual elements and textual descriptions, prioritizing precision over immediate response completion.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: be41c2278994, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT produce responses when multimodal content analysis reveals potential manipulation intended to circumvent safety measures through format-specific encoding or steganographic techniques.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8102248f85e5, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate responses to queries where modal processing limitations prevent adequate safety verification, instead explaining the specific technical constraints encountered.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: fcca01ebd710, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including biometric identifiers, location coordinates, and cross-modal personal signatures before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 82b1bd373007, Score: 61)\nMUST identify potential bias amplification when combining information from multiple sources and apply corrective context to maintain fairness standards.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 82b1bd373007, Score: 61)\nMUST identify potential bias amplification when combining information from multiple sources and apply corrective context to maintain fairness standards.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: b44a0295e754, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT produce outputs containing harmful visual-textual combinations that could amplify dangerous messaging.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
