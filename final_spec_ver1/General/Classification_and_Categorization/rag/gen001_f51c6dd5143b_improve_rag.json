    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework focused on ethical classification and categorization. They collectively emphasize avoiding harm, respecting cultural contexts, and ensuring fairness. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including sensitive content, discrimination, and high-stakes decisions. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks in classification tasks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, with identical or very similar specifications appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14, SPEC 18 and SPEC 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on ethical considerations. They balance security with usability, but some specs could be more detailed in terms of implementation guidance. The presence of repeated specs suggests room for streamlining to enhance maintainability."
