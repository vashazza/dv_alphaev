    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of classification and categorization. There are logical connections between requirements, such as addressing bias, ensuring factual accuracy, and handling sensitive content. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, legal and medical implications, emotional content, and emergency situations. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those involving subjective judgment."
