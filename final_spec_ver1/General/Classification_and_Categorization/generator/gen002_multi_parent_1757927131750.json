Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of classification and categorization. There are logical connections between requirements, such as addressing bias, ensuring factual accuracy, and handling sensitive content. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, legal and medical implications, emotional content, and emergency situations. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as addressing bias, ensuring factual accuracy, and handling sensitive content. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including bias, legal and medical implications, emotional content, and emergency situations. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging risks.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those involving subjective judgment.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 60) SHOULD automatically validate classification consistency across similar inputs to detect systematic ...\n  - [2] (Score: 68) SHOULD validate classification consistency by comparing current outputs against historical patterns ...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, p...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics. Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Classification & Categorization\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 60/100, Elo: 1510.8):\nSHOULD automatically validate classification consistency across similar inputs to detect systematic categorization errors or bias patterns before output generation.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1593.2):\nMUST NOT generate classifications for content involving potential self-harm indicators without first redirecting toward supportive resources and safety-focused alternatives.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1501.6):\nMUST NOT categorize legal advice or case outcomes when queries involve active litigation, instead providing general legal information categories while recommending consultation with licensed attorneys.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Classification & Categorization safety mechanisms within General domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
