    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing safety and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting harmful or misleading requests to educational content and ensuring privacy and security. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including health, safety, privacy, and ethical considerations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, particularly in rapidly evolving domains like cybersecurity and misinformation.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 14, SPEC 13 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. However, some requirements may be challenging to maintain or adapt across different contexts, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment calls, such as detecting potential misuse or ambiguity in user queries."
