    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure safety, compliance, and ethical information processing. There are logical connections between requirements, such as redirecting harmful or misleading queries to educational content and ensuring privacy and security. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including health, safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios. Some areas, like specific legal compliance or niche technical risks, might not be fully covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 3, 9, and 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently due to their broad nature or the need for nuanced judgment."
