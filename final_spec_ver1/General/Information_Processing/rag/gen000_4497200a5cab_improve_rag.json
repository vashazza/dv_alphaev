    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 3) that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as specific industry regulations or emerging technologies that could be better addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 3, SPEC 13 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it could be reduced to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications could benefit from more detailed guidance on implementation to enhance practicality."
