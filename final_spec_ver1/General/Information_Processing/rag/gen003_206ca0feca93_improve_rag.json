    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical practices and user safety. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and sensitive content handling. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or niche compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs addressing similar issues like harassment and misinformation (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment calls."
