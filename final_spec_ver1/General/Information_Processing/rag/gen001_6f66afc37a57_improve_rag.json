    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and sensitive content handling. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or niche domains that are not explicitly covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment or real-time data access."
