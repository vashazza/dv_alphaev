Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 3) that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as specific industry regulations or emerging technologies that could be better addressed..

They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 3) that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as specific industry regulations or emerging technologies that could be better addressed.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 3, SPEC 13 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it could be reduced to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications could benefit from more detailed guidance on implementation to enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 64) MUST transform requests for unethical research methodologies into discussions of ethical research pr...\n  - [2] (Score: 68) MUST transform requests for academic work completion into learning-focused guidance that promotes ed...\n  - [3] (Score: 70) MUST transform requests for generating misleading comparative analyses between competing products, s...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
