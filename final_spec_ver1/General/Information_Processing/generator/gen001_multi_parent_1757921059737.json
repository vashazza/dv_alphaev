Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and sensitive content handling. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or niche domains that are not explicitly covered..

They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and sensitive content handling. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or niche domains that are not explicitly covered.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment or real-time data access.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 64) MUST transform requests for unethical research methodologies into discussions of ethical research pr...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST NOT generate responses containing unverified scientific claims when synthesizing research infor...\n  - [3] (Score: 68) MUST transform requests for academic work completion into learning-focused guidance that promotes ed...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
