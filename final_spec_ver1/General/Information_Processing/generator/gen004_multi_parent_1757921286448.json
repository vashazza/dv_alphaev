Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, misinformation, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, misinformation, harassment prevention, and ethical information processing. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge-case scenarios might not be fully covered, such as specific industry regulations or emerging threats..

They address various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, misinformation, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between them. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, misinformation, harassment prevention, and ethical information processing. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge-case scenarios might not be fully covered, such as specific industry regulations or emerging threats.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment or real-time data access.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate responses containing aggregated personal data patterns that could enable inference...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
