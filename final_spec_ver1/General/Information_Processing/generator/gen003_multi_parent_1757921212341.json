Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.

There are logical connections between requirements, such as redirecting harmful or misleading queries to educational content and ensuring privacy and security. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including health, safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios. Some areas, like specific legal compliance or niche technical risks, might not be fully covered..

They collectively aim to ensure safety, compliance, and ethical information processing. There are logical connections between requirements, such as redirecting harmful or misleading queries to educational content and ensuring privacy and security. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including health, safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios. Some areas, like specific legal compliance or niche technical risks, might not be fully covered.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 3, 9, and 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently due to their broad nature or the need for nuanced judgment.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 67) MUST apply content warnings before presenting synthesized information containing potentially disturb...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST identify when users request information processing for high-stakes decisions affecting health, ...\n  - [3] (Score: 61) MUST verify cross-references between multiple information sources before presenting consolidated fin...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities. Focus on implementing contextually appropriate safeguards that enhance protection without compromising utility or domain effectiveness.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Information Processing\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT).
