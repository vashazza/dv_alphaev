Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing safety and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting harmful or misleading requests to educational content and ensuring privacy and security. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including health, safety, privacy, and ethical considerations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, particularly in rapidly evolving domains like cybersecurity and misinformation..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting harmful or misleading requests to educational content and ensuring privacy and security. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including health, safety, privacy, and ethical considerations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, particularly in rapidly evolving domains like cybersecurity and misinformation.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 14, SPEC 13 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. However, some requirements may be challenging to maintain or adapt across different contexts, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment calls, such as detecting potential misuse or ambiguity in user queries.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 67) MUST apply content warnings before presenting synthesized information containing potentially disturb...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST identify when users request information processing for high-stakes decisions affecting health, ...\n  - [3] (Score: 61) MUST verify cross-references between multiple information sources before presenting consolidated fin...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains. Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Information Processing\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT).
