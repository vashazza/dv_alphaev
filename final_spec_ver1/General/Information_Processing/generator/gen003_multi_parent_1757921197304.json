Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing, such as privacy, ethical considerations, and misinformation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical practices and user safety. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and sensitive content handling. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or niche compliance areas..

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical practices and user safety. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including privacy protection, ethical research, misinformation, and sensitive content handling. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging technologies or niche compliance areas.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs addressing similar issues like harassment and misinformation (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios, particularly those requiring nuanced judgment calls.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 64) MUST transform requests for unethical research methodologies into discussions of ethical research pr...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST NOT generate responses containing unverified scientific claims when synthesizing research infor...\n  - [3] (Score: 68) MUST transform requests for academic work completion into learning-focused guidance that promotes ed...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
