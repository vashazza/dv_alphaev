Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy. They address various aspects of data protection, user intent verification, and security practices. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 7, 8, 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion by introducing unnecessary duplication.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, user intent clarification, security practices, and prevention of harmful actions. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Target Spec: MUST validate that recommended external system interactions comply with standard security practices ...

They address various aspects of data protection, user intent verification, and security practices. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 7, 8, 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion by introducing unnecessary duplication.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, user intent clarification, security practices, and prevention of harmful actions. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 7, 8, 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these would enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) MUST validate that recommended external system interactions comply with standard security practices ...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST NOT provide integration instructions that could result in data corruption, system instability, ...\n  - [3] (Score: 71) MUST validate that proposed API calls and system integrations comply with applicable data protection...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
