Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety, user agency, and compliance. They collectively address various aspects of risk management, such as preventing harmful actions, ensuring user intent is clear, and safeguarding sensitive information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 19) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including prompt injection, ambiguous requests, harmful automation, and security circumvention. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as rare but high-impact security threats or novel attack vectors..

They collectively address various aspects of risk management, such as preventing harmful actions, ensuring user intent is clear, and safeguarding sensitive information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 19) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including prompt injection, ambiguous requests, harmful automation, and security circumvention. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as rare but high-impact security threats or novel attack vectors.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 19, SPEC 15 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on structured dialogue and verification processes. They balance security with usability, ensuring user agency and oversight. However, the repeated specifications could complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 72) MUST rewrite requests for harmful automation by redirecting toward manual verification steps and hum...\n  - [2] (Score: 70) MUST transform potentially harmful action requests into educational dialogues that explore safer app...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST transform requests for potentially dangerous specialized knowledge into educational overviews t...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
