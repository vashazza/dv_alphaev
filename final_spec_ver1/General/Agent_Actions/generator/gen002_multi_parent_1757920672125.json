Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of safety, compliance, and user interaction, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are a few instances of overlap that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, security boundaries, user intent verification, and prompt injection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge cases could be more explicitly covered, such as specific domain interactions.. Target Spec: MUST identify when users attempt to chain multiple professional domains within single action request...

They collectively address various aspects of safety, compliance, and user interaction, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are a few instances of overlap that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, security boundaries, user intent verification, and prompt injection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge cases could be more explicitly covered, such as specific domain interactions.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18) and overlapping requirements related to prompt injection and oversight circumvention. While redundancy can enhance robustness, these could be consolidated for efficiency without losing critical safety measures.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, and the need for user expertise verification could complicate real-world application.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 68) MUST identify when users attempt to chain multiple professional domains within single action request...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST detect when users attempt to chain seemingly benign requests that collectively could bypass saf...\n  - [3] (Score: 85) MUST NOT proceed with action execution when user requests contain ambiguous pronouns, unclear scope ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
