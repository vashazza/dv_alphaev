    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy. They address various aspects of data protection, user intent verification, and security practices. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 7, 8, 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion by introducing unnecessary duplication.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, user intent clarification, security practices, and prevention of harmful actions. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging threats to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, 7, 8, 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these would enhance practicality."
