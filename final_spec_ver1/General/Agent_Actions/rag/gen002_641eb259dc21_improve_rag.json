    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of safety, compliance, and user interaction, with logical connections between requirements such as user intent verification, data protection, and risk mitigation. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical compliance areas like data protection, user intent verification, and adversarial input handling. However, there could be more explicit coverage of certain edge cases, such as nuanced social engineering tactics or emerging threat vectors.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as data protection and adversarial input handling, there are instances of overlapping requirements that could be consolidated. For example, similar specifications regarding adversarial input handling appear twice, indicating potential for optimization.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse systems and environments. Further refinement could enhance their real-world applicability."
