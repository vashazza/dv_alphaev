    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of safety, compliance, and user interaction, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are a few instances of overlap that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including data protection, security boundaries, user intent verification, and prompt injection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge cases could be more explicitly covered, such as specific domain interactions.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18) and overlapping requirements related to prompt injection and oversight circumvention. While redundancy can enhance robustness, these could be consolidated for efficiency without losing critical safety measures.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, and the need for user expertise verification could complicate real-world application."
