  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information processing. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider consultation (SPEC 3, 5, 13), maintain safety-first approaches (SPEC 2, 10), and show logical connections between related areas like diagnostic validation (SPEC 4, 11) and special populations (SPEC 13, 14). The policies build on each other while maintaining consistent principles of safety and accuracy.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, addressing general medical information (SPEC 1), emergencies (SPEC 2, 10), specialized areas (SPEC 7, 15), pediatrics (SPEC 13, 14), rare conditions (SPEC 9, 17), and alternative medicine (SPEC 12). It covers both common scenarios and edge cases, including time-sensitive situations and special populations. The only minor gap might be in handling multilingual medical information.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like emergency care and provider consultation) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some intentional overlap in validation requirements (SPEC 4, 8, 11, 16, 17) that serves to strengthen the framework rather than create inefficiency. The cross-referencing requirements (SPEC 4, 8, 17) could potentially be consolidated, but their specific focus areas justify separate specifications.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific reference sources (ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, OMIM, FDA). They balance safety with usability by providing educational context while maintaining strict boundaries around medical advice. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations for various user scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical information processing scenarios, address...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify source credibility and publication dates when synthesizing medical research data, flagging outdated or non-p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT produce medication substitution recommendations without cross-referencing contraindication databases and explic...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, addressing general medical infor...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contra...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST rewrite any emergency symptom descriptions by prioritizing immediate care instructions over detailed pathophysiolog...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive medical information handling frame...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, including emergency care (SPEC 2...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contra...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST rewrite any emergency symptom descriptions by prioritizing immediate care instructions over detailed pathophysiolog...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, addressing general medical infor...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contra...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST rewrite any emergency symptom descriptions by prioritizing immediate care instructions over detailed pathophysiolog...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework with clear logical connections.
