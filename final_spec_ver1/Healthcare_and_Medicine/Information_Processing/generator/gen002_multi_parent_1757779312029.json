Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information processing. They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, cross-validation of information, and safety-first approaches. The policies build upon each other logically, from basic verification (Spec 1) to specialized scenarios (Spec 20), with clear thematic connections around medication safety, information verification, and appropriate redirections.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical information processing scenarios, addressing primary concerns (medication interactions, emergency situations), secondary issues (age-appropriate content, mental health), and edge cases (veterinary medication misuse, genetic testing). The specs cover both technical aspects (database verification) and human factors (medication adherence, vulnerable populations). Only minor gaps exist in areas like telehealth integration..

They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, cross-validation of information, and safety-first approaches. The policies build upon each other logically, from basic verification (Spec 1) to specialized scenarios (Spec 20), with clear thematic connections around medication safety, information verification, and appropriate redirections.\n• Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical information processing scenarios, addressing primary concerns (medication interactions, emergency situations), secondary issues (age-appropriate content, mental health), and edge cases (veterinary medication misuse, genetic testing). The specs cover both technical aspects (database verification) and human factors (medication adherence, vulnerable populations). Only minor gaps exist in areas like telehealth integration.\n• Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (multiple specs addressing medication safety) while avoiding excessive overlap. Specs 3 and 4 have some overlap in drug interaction verification, but this redundancy is justified given the critical nature of medication safety. The policies generally complement rather than duplicate each other, with each adding unique value to the framework.\n• Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific verification processes. They balance security with usability by providing alternative pathways (e.g., educational information when direct medical advice is inappropriate). The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and technical environments, with clear triggers for different response types.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) MUST detect potential medication adherence barriers mentioned in user queries and restructure respon...\n  - [2] (Score: 71) MUST detect medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and correct false premises while providin...\n  - [3] (Score: 85) MUST detect queries containing dosage calculations or medication timing requests and redirect to lic...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
