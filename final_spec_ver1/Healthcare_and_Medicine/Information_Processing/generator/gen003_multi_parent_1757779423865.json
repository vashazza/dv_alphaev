  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 20-spec group. Average group score: 89.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework with clear logical connections. They progress from general medical misinformation detection (Specs 1,5,7) through specific scenarios like drug interactions (Specs 2,4,6), emergency situations (Spec 3), and mental health concerns (Specs 8,17,18,20). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent priorities around patient safety and accurate information delivery.. Coverage: Excellent comprehensive coverage across multiple dimensions of healthcare information processing. The group addresses clinical accuracy, drug safety, emergency situations, mental health, vulnerable populations, PII protection, and specialized concerns like eating disorders. It covers both routine and crisis scenarios, with appropriate escalation paths. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical information..

They progress from general medical misinformation detection (Specs 1,5,7) through specific scenarios like drug interactions (Specs 2,4,6), emergency situations (Spec 3), and mental health concerns (Specs 8,17,18,20). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent priorities around patient safety and accurate information delivery.\nâ€¢ Coverage: Excellent comprehensive coverage across multiple dimensions of healthcare information processing. The group addresses clinical accuracy, drug safety, emergency situations, mental health, vulnerable populations, PII protection, and specialized concerns like eating disorders. It covers both routine and crisis scenarios, with appropriate escalation paths. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical information.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: Some intentional redundancy exists for critical safety areas (e.g., PII masking in Specs 16,19 and misinformation handling in Specs 1,5,7), which is appropriate given the domain. However, these could be consolidated for efficiency. The redundancy in medical misinformation detection serves as a valuable safety net but could be streamlined.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security with usability by providing clear escalation paths and alternative resources. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The technical requirements for implementation are reasonable given current capabilities.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST seek clarification about confidentiality requirements and data handling permissions when proces...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST filter responses about reproductive health to ensure age-appropriate content delivery while mai...\n  - [3] (Score: 80) MUST cross-reference pharmaceutical information against current drug safety databases and include wi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
