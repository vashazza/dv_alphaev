  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive medical information handling framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider consultation (SPEC 3, 5, 13), maintain safety-first approaches (SPEC 2, 10), and show logical interconnections between different medical domains. The policies build upon each other, creating a robust safety net for medical information processing.. Coverage: The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing general medical information (SPEC 1), emergencies (SPEC 2, 10), specialized populations (SPEC 13, 14), rare conditions (SPEC 9, 17), end-of-life care (SPEC 7), and reproductive health (SPEC 15). The inclusion of alternative medicine (SPEC 12) and device safety (SPEC 8) shows attention to peripheral but important areas. Only minor gaps exist in areas like chronic disease management.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like emergency care and provider consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some beneficial overlap between specs dealing with data validation (SPEC 4, 8, 11, 17) that reinforces important safety checks without being excessive. The cross-referencing requirements (SPEC 4, 8, 17) could potentially be consolidated, but their specific focuses justify separate treatment.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific reference sources (ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, OMIM, FDA). The specs balance safety with usability by providing educational context while maintaining firm boundaries on medical advice. The consistent emphasis on healthcare provider consultation creates a clear operational framework. The verification requirements are specific and achievable..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for medic...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, addressing general medical infor...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contra...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST rewrite any emergency symptom descriptions by prioritizing immediate care instructions over detailed pathophysiolog...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive medical information handling frame...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, including emergency care (SPEC 2...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contra...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST rewrite any emergency symptom descriptions by prioritizing immediate care instructions over detailed pathophysiolog...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare information handling fr...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing pharmaceutical saf...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify source credibility and publication dates when synthesizing medical research data, flagging outdated or non-p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT produce medication substitution recommendations without cross-referencing contraindication databases and explic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 88/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive framework that addres...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across critical healthcare domains including medica...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns by comparing generated content against established medical fact-ch...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST validate contraindication warnings against current prescribing information and drug labeling when discussing therap...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical information scenarios, including ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST verify source credibility and publication dates when synthesizing medical research data, flagging outdated or non-p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT produce medication substitution recommendations without cross-referencing contraindication databases and explic...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 89/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, particularly in how they handle medical misin...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows excellent coverage across multiple critical areas including misinformation de...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns by comparing generated content against established medical fact-ch...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST validate contraindication warnings against current prescribing information and drug labeling when discussing therap...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive medical information handling framework.
