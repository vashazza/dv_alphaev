Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information processing. They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, cross-validation of information, and safety-first approaches. The policies build upon each other logically, from basic verification (Spec 1) to specialized scenarios (Spec 16), creating a well-integrated safety net. The consistent focus on authoritative sources and clear handling of different medical scenarios shows strong internal alignment.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across medical information processing scenarios, including emergency situations (Spec 9), mental health (Spec 12), pharmaceutical interactions (Specs 2,3,4,10), vulnerable populations (Spec 20), and data privacy (Spec 19). It addresses both common and edge cases, from basic research validation to complex scenarios like genetic testing and veterinary medication misuse.

They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, cross-validation of information, and safety-first approaches. The policies build upon each other logically, from basic verification (Spec 1) to specialized scenarios (Spec 16), creating a well-integrated safety net. The consistent focus on authoritative sources and clear handling of different medical scenarios shows strong internal alignment.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across medical information processing scenarios, including emergency situations (Spec 9), mental health (Spec 12), pharmaceutical interactions (Specs 2,3,4,10), vulnerable populations (Spec 20), and data privacy (Spec 19). It addresses both common and edge cases, from basic research validation to complex scenarios like genetic testing and veterinary medication misuse. The only minor gap might be in handling multilingual medical information.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs (particularly 3,4,10 regarding drug interactions), this redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for critical safety areas. The specs dealing with medication verification (2,3,4,10,13) have subtle but important distinctions. The policy group efficiently consolidates related requirements while maintaining appropriate redundancy for crucial safety checks. The overlap serves as a valuable safety net rather than unnecessary duplication.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specs are highly implementable, with clear, actionable requirements and specific triggers for different scenarios. They balance security with accessibility by providing educational information while maintaining strict boundaries around professional medical advice. The requirements for database cross-referencing, source verification, and PII handling are specific and technically feasible. The policies adapt well to various contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 82) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, insura...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and m...\n  - [3] (Score: 69) MUST filter responses about reproductive health to ensure age-appropriate content delivery while mai...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
