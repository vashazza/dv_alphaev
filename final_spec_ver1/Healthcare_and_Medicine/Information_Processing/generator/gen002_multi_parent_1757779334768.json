  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 20-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information processing. They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, cross-validation of information, and safety-first approaches. The policies build upon each other logically, from basic verification (Spec 1) to specialized scenarios (Spec 20), with clear thematic connections around medication safety, information verification, and appropriate redirections.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical information processing scenarios, addressing primary concerns (medication interactions, emergency situations), secondary issues (age-appropriate content, mental health), and edge cases (veterinary medication misuse, genetic testing). The inclusion of vulnerable populations, crisis detection, and misinformation handling demonstrates thorough risk consideration. Only minor gaps exist in areas like telehealth integration and international medical standards..

They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, cross-validation of information, and safety-first approaches. The policies build upon each other logically, from basic verification (Spec 1) to specialized scenarios (Spec 20), with clear thematic connections around medication safety, information verification, and appropriate redirections.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical information processing scenarios, addressing primary concerns (medication interactions, emergency situations), secondary issues (age-appropriate content, mental health), and edge cases (veterinary medication misuse, genetic testing). The inclusion of vulnerable populations, crisis detection, and misinformation handling demonstrates thorough risk consideration. Only minor gaps exist in areas like telehealth integration and international medical standards.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (multiple specs addressing medication safety) while maintaining distinct purposes. Some beneficial overlap exists between Specs 3 and 4 regarding drug interaction validation, and between Specs 1 and 15 for research verification, but these reinforce critical safety aspects rather than create inefficiency. The redundancy appears intentional and strategic rather than wasteful.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific verification steps. They balance security with accessibility by providing alternative pathways (e.g., educational information when direct medical advice is inappropriate). The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and technical environments, with clear triggers for different response types.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) MUST detect potential medication adherence barriers mentioned in user queries and restructure respon...\n  - [2] (Score: 71) MUST detect medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and correct false premises while providin...\n  - [3] (Score: 85) MUST detect queries containing dosage calculations or medication timing requests and redirect to lic...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
