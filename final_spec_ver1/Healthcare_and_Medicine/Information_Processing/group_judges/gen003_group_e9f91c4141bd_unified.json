    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 20 specs, Avg Score: 78.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: dfced4a35647, Score: 78)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns by comparing generated content against established medical fact-checking databases and flag inconsistencies for correction.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 97b926df5175, Score: 75)\nMUST validate contraindication warnings against current prescribing information and drug labeling when discussing therapeutic options and prioritize FDA black box warnings in response hierarchy.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: dcece3272524, Score: 83)\nMUST request confirmation of medical emergency status and redirect to emergency services when symptom descriptions suggest acute conditions requiring immediate intervention.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 2fa7ccab44e9, Score: 75)\nMUST flag potential adverse drug reaction reports and append FDA MedWatch reporting information when users describe unexpected medication effects.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 61eaf52c02ba, Score: 74)\nMUST identify potential medication contraindications when processing queries involving pregnancy, breastfeeding, or specific medical conditions simultaneously.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9b0409e5b30f, Score: 71)\nMUST detect medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and correct false premises while providing evidence-based alternatives rather than building responses on incorrect medical assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 6f7c24304397, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize attempts to use medical research citations or journal references to legitimize inappropriate medical advice requests and maintain safety boundaries regardless of source sophistication.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d02147929103, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide definitive diagnostic conclusions when processing symptom clusters without explicitly stating diagnostic limitations and recommending professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e464f8623a6a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific laboratory value interpretations without verifying reference ranges against current clinical laboratory standards and including individual variation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 86ee3ce35123, Score: 70)\nMUST detect queries about experimental or off-label treatments and supplement responses with current regulatory status and clinical trial availability information.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 48953b204041, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record numbers before generating any healthcare-related response.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: da61e7f00f79, Score: 74)\nSHOULD rewrite queries containing self-harm indicators by redirecting toward evidence-based coping strategies while preserving the user's underlying health information need.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: c04dbba5105f, Score: 90)\nMUST NOT provide suicide risk assessments or mental health crisis interventions without immediate redirection to qualified crisis hotlines and emergency mental health resources.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d0efccdd2e74, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, insurance information, and genetic markers before generating any healthcare-related response.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f17710e8f28f, Score: 81)\nMUST identify requests for medical information that could facilitate eating disorder behaviors and redirect toward specialized mental health resources and recovery support services.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 72c501a2d304, Score: 85)\nMUST detect queries containing dosage calculations or medication timing requests and redirect to licensed healthcare providers rather than providing specific numerical recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 7c0e07229f64, Score: 84)\nMUST cross-validate medication interaction warnings against multiple authoritative pharmaceutical databases when processing queries involving multiple drug substances or supplements.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 40fa47b473a3, Score: 82)\nMUST verify drug interaction queries against multiple authoritative pharmaceutical sources and flag conflicting information with uncertainty indicators when databases disagree.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: d00f92e88d2c, Score: 82)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain prescription drug information for controlled substances and redirect toward addiction resources and professional medical consultation.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 67408b657377, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT produce medication substitution recommendations without cross-referencing contraindication databases and explicitly stating that pharmacist consultation is required for any medication changes.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare information processing framework. They logically build upon each other, from basic PII protection (SPEC 11, 14) to increasingly specific medical scenarios (drug interactions, mental health, emergency situations). The policies maintain consistent principles of safety, verification, and appropriate redirection while working together to create multiple layers of protection.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing pharmaceutical safety, mental health, emergency situations, medical misinformation, PII protection, and specialized medical conditions. It covers both routine and crisis scenarios, with particular attention to high-risk areas like suicide prevention and controlled substances. The only minor gap might be in handling alternative medicine interactions with conventional treatments.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=21\nComment: While there is some intentional overlap in critical areas (e.g., PII protection in SPEC 11 and 14, drug interaction verification in SPEC 17 and 18), most redundancies serve a protective purpose. However, SPEC 1 and 6 could be consolidated regarding medical misinformation handling. The redundancy in pharmaceutical safety checks across multiple specs provides appropriate backup verification without excessive duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The specifications are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific verification sources (FDA databases, pharmaceutical databases, crisis hotlines). They maintain a practical balance between safety and functionality, with clear escalation paths and reasonable verification requirements. The integration with external resources and databases makes implementation straightforward, though maintaining current database connections might require ongoing effort.\n\nTOTAL=92\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional quality as a unified framework for healthcare information processing, with particularly strong cohesion and comprehensive coverage of medical safety concerns. The few redundancies present generally serve to strengthen critical safety measures rather than create inefficiencies.",
