  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework. They flow naturally from information validation (Specs 1,2) to emergency handling (Spec 3), adverse event reporting (Spec 4), and specialized scenarios (Specs 15-20). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent priorities around patient safety, data privacy, and appropriate medical guidance.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows excellent coverage across multiple critical areas including misinformation detection, drug safety, emergency situations, mental health, vulnerable populations, PII protection, and specialized medical conditions. It addresses both routine scenarios and edge cases like self-harm and eating disorders. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical information scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., Specs 1,5,7 on misinformation; Specs 16,19 on PII), this redundancy appears intentional for critical safety areas. However, the misinformation-related specs could be consolidated more efficiently. The redundancy in PII protection helps ensure robust coverage of different types of sensitive information.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security with usability by providing alternative pathways rather than just blocking responses. The requirements for database checking and validation are implementable with current technology. The main challenge might be maintaining up-to-date medical databases for all referenced checks."
