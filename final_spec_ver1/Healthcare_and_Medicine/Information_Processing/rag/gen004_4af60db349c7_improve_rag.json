    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information handling. They consistently emphasize professional consultation (SPEC 3, 5, 13), maintain safety-first approaches (SPEC 2, 10), and show clear progression from general information handling to specific medical scenarios. The policies work together to create multiple layers of validation and safety checks.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, including emergency care (SPEC 2, 10), pediatrics (SPEC 13, 14), rare diseases (SPEC 9, 17), end-of-life care (SPEC 7), and reproductive health (SPEC 15). It addresses both common and edge cases, covering information synthesis, validation, and redirection requirements. The inclusion of alternative medicine (SPEC 12) and genetic conditions (SPEC 17) demonstrates thorough domain coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like professional consultation requirements) while maintaining distinct purposes. There's some beneficial overlap in validation requirements (SPEC 4, 8, 11, 16) that reinforces safety without being excessive. The cross-referencing requirements (SPEC 4, 8, 17) are well-distributed across different medical domains.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific reference sources (ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, OMIM, FDA). The policies balance safety with usability by providing educational context while maintaining strict boundaries around medical advice. The verification and validation requirements are specific and measurable, making them practical for real-world implementation."
