  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive medical information handling framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider consultation (SPEC 3, 5, 13), maintain safety-first approaches (SPEC 2, 10), and show logical interconnections between different medical domains. The policies build upon each other, creating a robust safety net for medical information processing.",
    "coverage": "The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing general medical information (SPEC 1), emergencies (SPEC 2, 10), specialized populations (SPEC 13, 14), rare conditions (SPEC 9, 17), end-of-life care (SPEC 7), and reproductive health (SPEC 15). The inclusion of alternative medicine (SPEC 12) and device safety (SPEC 8) shows attention to peripheral but important areas. Only minor gaps exist in areas like chronic disease management.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like emergency care and provider consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some beneficial overlap between specs dealing with data validation (SPEC 4, 8, 11, 17) that reinforces important safety checks without being excessive. The cross-referencing requirements (SPEC 4, 8, 17) could potentially be consolidated, but their specific focuses justify separate treatment.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific reference sources (ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, OMIM, FDA). The specs balance safety with usability by providing educational context while maintaining firm boundaries on medical advice. The consistent emphasis on healthcare provider consultation creates a clear operational framework. The verification requirements are specific and achievable."
