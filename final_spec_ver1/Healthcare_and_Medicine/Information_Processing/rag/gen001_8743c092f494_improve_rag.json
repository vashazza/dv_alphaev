    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare information safety framework. They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, cross-validation of information, and appropriate handling of sensitive medical data. The policies build upon each other logically, from general information handling (Spec 1) to specific use cases (Specs 5, 12, 16), creating a well-integrated safety net.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing pharmaceutical safety, mental health, emergency situations, vulnerable populations, genetic testing, and medical misinformation. It covers both common scenarios and edge cases (like veterinary medication misuse, Spec 16). The inclusion of crisis detection (Spec 12) and specialized population considerations (Spec 20) demonstrates thorough risk assessment.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 3, 4, and 10 regarding drug interaction checking, this redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical safety areas. The specs generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage through complementary requirements. Some consolidation could be possible between Specs 1 and 15 regarding research validation.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable criteria and specific validation steps. They balance security with accessibility by providing educational alternatives when direct medical advice is inappropriate. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and technical implementations, with clear triggers for different response types."
