    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive medical information handling framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider consultation (SPEC 3, 5, 13), maintain safety-first approaches (SPEC 2, 10), and show logical interconnections between different medical domains. The policies build on each other well, from general medical information handling to specific scenarios like pediatrics and emergency care.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, including emergency care (SPEC 2, 10), laboratory results (SPEC 11), pediatric care (SPEC 13, 14), reproductive health (SPEC 15), rare diseases (SPEC 9, 17), and end-of-life care (SPEC 7). It addresses both common and edge cases, covering various medical information types and special populations. The only minor gap might be in mental health coverage beyond DSM-5-TR references.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like safety warnings and healthcare provider consultation) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap in validation requirements (SPEC 4, 8, 11, 16, 17), each instance serves a specific purpose. The redundancy appears intentional for safety-critical aspects while avoiding unnecessary duplication in other areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable items and specific reference sources (ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, OMIM, FDA). They balance safety with usability by providing educational context while maintaining appropriate boundaries. The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like age-appropriate communication and guardian consent."
