    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses interconnected aspects of healthcare decision support. There's clear logical progression from general clinical validation (Spec 1) through specialized domains (pediatrics, mental health, infectious disease) with consistent emphasis on safety, verification, and evidence-based practice. The specs build upon each other effectively, with complementary requirements for different healthcare scenarios while maintaining consistent principles around safety, verification, and regulatory compliance.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing primary clinical care, specialized fields (pediatrics, mental health, infectious disease), vulnerable populations, cultural considerations, and technical aspects (terminology, coding). It covers both routine and emergency scenarios, regulatory compliance, and safety protocols. The inclusion of specs for experimental treatments, cultural sensitivity, and healthcare disparities demonstrates thorough consideration of edge cases. Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and international healthcare standards.",
    "redundancy": "The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas (safety protocols, verification requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some intentional overlap in verification protocols (Specs 13, 14) that serves a protective purpose. The policies addressing experimental treatments (Specs 2, 11) could be slightly more consolidated, but their distinct focuses (promotional language vs. informed consent) justify separation.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific verification steps, data sources, and response protocols. They balance security with clinical utility through systematic approaches to information gathering and verification. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. Implementation guidance is clear, though some specs (like cultural sensitivity requirements) might benefit from more specific operational details."
