    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical decision-making from multiple complementary angles. They consistently emphasize safety, verification, and uncertainty quantification (Specs 2, 12, 15). The policies build on each other logically, with specialized protocols for different medical domains (mental health, reproductive health, pediatrics) while maintaining consistent principles around verification, safety, and consultation pathways.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing primary care, specialized medicine, emergency situations, vulnerable populations, and edge cases. It covers both common scenarios (medication management, diagnostic support) and critical special cases (end-of-life care, mental health crises, experimental treatments). The inclusion of both clinical and ethical considerations (Specs 5, 8, 13) demonstrates comprehensive risk management.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical safety areas (verification protocols, consultation requirements) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap in verification requirements across different medical domains (Specs 18, 19), this represents appropriate reinforcement rather than inefficient duplication. The policies efficiently consolidate similar requirements while maintaining domain-specific nuances.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly actionable and implementable, with clear triggers and responses. They balance safety with usability by providing specific guidance on when to escalate (Spec 17), when to gather more information (Spec 20), and how to handle uncertainty (Spec 2). The policies are adaptable across different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The verification and consultation pathways are well-defined and practical."
