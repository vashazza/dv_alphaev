    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that consistently emphasizes patient safety, professional oversight, and appropriate redirections. They share common principles around verification, risk assessment, and clinical validation. The specs build on each other logically - from general healthcare guidance to specialized domains (oncology, pediatrics, mental health), while maintaining consistent approaches to safety and verification.",
    "coverage": "The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing major healthcare domains (oncology, pediatrics, mental health, emergency care), vulnerable populations, medication management, and various clinical scenarios. The specs account for both routine and crisis situations, while covering technical aspects (PII protection, database verification) and ethical considerations. Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and cross-border medical advice.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between specs (particularly around vulnerable populations in specs 13 and 15), most redundancy appears intentional and serves to reinforce critical safety measures. The overlap between mental health crisis management (specs 2, 4, 5) provides appropriate redundancy for high-risk scenarios. Some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising safety.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific verification steps and response protocols. They balance safety requirements with practical implementation through structured questioning, database verification, and clear redirection pathways. The framework allows for real-world application while maintaining rigid safety standards. The main challenge might be implementing all verification steps without creating excessive user friction."
