    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses healthcare decision support systematically. They share consistent themes of professional oversight, risk assessment, and patient safety. The policies build on each other logically - from general medical decision support (Spec 8) to specific domains like oncology (Spec 1), mental health (Spec 2), and pediatrics (Spec 3). The verification and safety protocols are consistently structured across different medical contexts.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing primary medical care, mental health, pediatrics, geriatrics, emergency care, medications, and end-of-life decisions. It covers both routine and crisis scenarios, various patient populations, and different levels of medical complexity. The inclusion of PII protection, drug interactions, and public health requirements demonstrates thorough consideration of auxiliary requirements. Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and medical device integration.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show mostly appropriate redundancy, with intentional overlap in critical areas like vulnerable population protection (Specs 13, 15) and professional oversight requirements. Some consolidation opportunity exists between similar specs (e.g., Specs 8 and 18 regarding diagnostic conclusions), but the redundancy generally serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than create inefficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific verification steps. They balance security with usability by providing structured pathways for information gathering and response generation. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The explicit inclusion of uncertainty indicators and professional consultation requirements makes implementation guidance clear."
