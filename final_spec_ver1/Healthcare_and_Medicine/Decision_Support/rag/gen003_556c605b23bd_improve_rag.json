    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical decision support systematically. They share common themes of safety, verification, and uncertainty quantification. The specs build on each other logically - from general medical validation (Spec 1) to specific domains like genetics (Spec 8) and emergency care (Spec 17). The consistent emphasis on verification, consultation pathways, and risk assessment creates a unified approach.",
    "coverage": "The coverage is nearly comprehensive, addressing major healthcare domains including emergency care, mental health, pediatrics, reproductive health, genetics, pharmaceuticals, and end-of-life care. The specs account for various stakeholders (patients, providers, vulnerable populations) and different types of medical decisions. Edge cases are well-considered through specs like 16 (cognitive biases) and 20 (insufficient clinical context). Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and cross-border medical advice.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (safety verification, vulnerable population protection) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional reinforcement exists between specs 13 and 19 regarding vulnerable populations, and between 4 and 15 regarding experimental treatments, but these serve to strengthen rather than duplicate protection. The redundancy is strategic and enhances safety without creating inefficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific verification protocols. They balance safety with usability through systematic approaches to information gathering and verification. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and scale levels. The language is precise and technical while remaining comprehensible. Integration with existing healthcare systems and databases is well-considered (e.g., Specs 9, 11)."
