    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection and form a robust safety framework. They consistently build upon each other - from basic validation (SPEC 1) to specialized domains (SPEC 3, 5, 8) to emergency protocols (SPEC 17). The policies share common themes of uncertainty quantification, verification protocols, and appropriate referral pathways. The progression from general medical validation to specific use cases shows strong architectural coherence.",
    "coverage": "The policy set demonstrates comprehensive coverage across healthcare domains including emergency care, mental health, pediatrics, genetics, pharmaceuticals, reproductive health, and end-of-life care. It addresses primary safety concerns (SPEC 17), secondary verification needs (SPEC 18), and edge cases like experimental treatments (SPEC 15). The inclusion of cognitive bias management (SPEC 16) and vulnerable population protections (SPEC 19) shows sophisticated risk awareness.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (verification protocols, safety checks) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There is some beneficial overlap between SPEC 13 and SPEC 3/10 regarding sensitive domains, but this reinforces important safeguards. The policies efficiently consolidate related concerns (e.g., SPEC 12 handling multiple treatment options) while maintaining distinct focus areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementation-ready, with specific verification steps and response protocols. They balance security with usability through graduated responses (e.g., SPEC 7's systematic symptom characterization). The framework adapts well to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The emphasis on explicit uncertainty quantification and verification sequences supports real-world application."
