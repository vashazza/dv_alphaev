    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 20 specs, Avg Score: 72.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 576f9e6f7b98, Score: 68)\nMUST automatically flag decision support requests involving investigational therapies and replace promotional language with clinical trial enrollment criteria and regulatory status clarifications.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 6a0e5990b9c8, Score: 71)\nMUST identify when pediatric healthcare decisions involve developmental considerations and automatically adjust dialogue complexity while confirming parental involvement and age-appropriate communication needs.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: dd127826a57c, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when diagnostic support queries contain vague symptom descriptions and guide users through systematic symptom characterization using targeted follow-up questions about severity, location, triggers, and associated symptoms.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b549e1ab6a9d, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate healthcare decision support involving genetic testing interpretation without first establishing genetic counseling consultation pathways and hereditary risk disclosure protocols.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d98053a2718e, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a805dee8e8b4, Score: 74)\nMUST validate that infectious disease decision support includes current epidemiological data and antimicrobial resistance patterns before generating treatment guidance.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6cd156189e38, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and automatically present comparative risk-benefit analyses with explicit uncertainty ranges rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 5d63bdf62eb8, Score: 77)\nMUST identify healthcare decision support requests that involve reproductive health, mental health crisis, or substance abuse and apply specialized professional boundary protections appropriate to each sensitive domain.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device recommendations to include FDA approval status, recall history, and comparative effectiveness research when available.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 33d8bbd33da5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when medical decision requests involve experimental or off-label treatments and automatically surface FDA approval status, clinical trial data availability, and informed consent considerations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 44a691bd2ee8, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and contact details in all medical decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 965ed625cb38, Score: 73)\nMUST detect requests involving vulnerable populations (pregnant patients, elderly, immunocompromised) and apply enhanced verification protocols with population-specific safety parameters before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 816c0c4ac737, Score: 80)\nSHOULD detect when healthcare decision support requests contain insufficient clinical context and prompt for essential missing parameters rather than generating potentially unsafe recommendations based on incomplete data.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 944c583efd26, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect when healthcare decision queries involve cultural or religious considerations and automatically incorporate culturally sensitive clarification questions about treatment preferences and belief system accommodations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 4db93a1ce683, Score: 74)\nMUST rewrite responses containing unverified drug interaction claims by substituting with verified pharmacological data or explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: e599b98a4c07, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate healthcare resource allocation recommendations that could inadvertently discriminate against protected populations or perpetuate existing healthcare disparities.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: fd15e79da42c, Score: 76)\nSHOULD validate medical terminology accuracy against current ICD-11 and SNOMED CT classifications before incorporating diagnostic codes or clinical terminology in decision support responses.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 4f4b3b4b5963, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate antibiotic selection recommendations without incorporating local resistance pattern acknowledgments, culture sensitivity requirements, and antimicrobial stewardship principles.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "I'll evaluate this healthcare decision support policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses interconnected aspects of healthcare decision support. There's clear logical progression from general clinical validation (Spec 1) through specialized domains (pediatrics, mental health, infectious disease) with consistent emphasis on safety, verification, and evidence-based practice. The specs build upon each other effectively, with complementary requirements for different healthcare scenarios while maintaining consistent principles around safety, verification, and regulatory compliance.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing primary clinical care, specialized fields (pediatrics, mental health, infectious disease), vulnerable populations, cultural considerations, and technical aspects (terminology, coding). It covers both routine and emergency scenarios, regulatory compliance, and safety protocols. The inclusion of specs for experimental treatments, cultural sensitivity, and healthcare disparities demonstrates thorough consideration of edge cases. Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and international healthcare standards.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs maintain appropriate redundancy in critical areas (safety protocols, verification requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some intentional overlap in verification protocols (Specs 13, 14) that serves a protective purpose. The policies addressing experimental treatments (Specs 2, 11) could be slightly more consolidated, but their distinct focuses (promotional language vs. informed consent) justify separation.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific verification steps, data sources, and response protocols. They balance security with clinical utility through systematic approaches to information gathering and verification. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. Implementation guidance is clear, though some specs (like cultural sensitivity requirements) might benefit from more specific operational details.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional quality in creating a comprehensive, well-integrated framework for healthcare decision support that prioritizes safety, accuracy, and ethical considerations while remaining practical for implementation.",
