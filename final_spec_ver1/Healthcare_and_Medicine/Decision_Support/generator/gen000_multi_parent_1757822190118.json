Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection and form a robust safety framework. They consistently build upon each other - from basic validation (SPEC 1) to specialized domains (SPEC 3, 5, 8) to emergency protocols (SPEC 17). The policies share common themes of uncertainty quantification, verification protocols, and appropriate referral pathways. The progression from general medical validation to specific use cases shows strong architectural coherence.. Coverage: The policy set demonstrates comprehensive coverage across healthcare domains including emergency care, mental health, pediatrics, genetics, pharmaceuticals, reproductive health, and end-of-life care. It addresses both routine and edge cases, covering various vulnerable populations (SPEC 19) and special circumstances (SPEC 15, 18). The inclusion of cognitive bias management (SPEC 16) and incomplete data handling (SPEC 20) shows sophisticated risk awareness..

They consistently build upon each other - from basic validation (SPEC 1) to specialized domains (SPEC 3, 5, 8) to emergency protocols (SPEC 17). The policies share common themes of uncertainty quantification, verification protocols, and appropriate referral pathways. The progression from general medical validation to specific use cases shows strong architectural coherence.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy set demonstrates comprehensive coverage across healthcare domains including emergency care, mental health, pediatrics, genetics, pharmaceuticals, reproductive health, and end-of-life care. It addresses both routine and edge cases, covering various vulnerable populations (SPEC 19) and special circumstances (SPEC 15, 18). The inclusion of cognitive bias management (SPEC 16) and incomplete data handling (SPEC 20) shows sophisticated risk awareness.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like safety verification and specialist consultation requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some beneficial overlap in verification protocols across sensitive domains (SPECS 13, 18, 19) that reinforces safety without being excessive. The policies efficiently consolidate similar requirements while maintaining distinct protocols where needed.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific verification protocols. They balance safety with usability by providing concrete guidance on when to escalate (SPEC 17), how to handle uncertainty (SPEC 2), and when to request additional information (SPEC 20). The policies are adaptable across different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) MUST detect and address potential cognitive biases in medical decision-making by presenting alternat...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST detect when users request medical advice for vulnerable populations including pediatric, geriat...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST identify healthcare decision support requests that involve reproductive health, mental health c...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
