Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses multiple interconnected aspects of healthcare decision support. They consistently emphasize professional oversight, safety protocols, and appropriate redirections. The policies build on each other logically, from general healthcare principles to specific scenarios like oncology, mental health, and pediatrics. The consistent emphasis on verification, safety checks, and professional consultation creates a strong unified approach.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, including mental health, pediatrics, oncology, infectious diseases, medication management, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both routine and crisis scenarios, considers cultural aspects, and covers technical requirements (ICD-11, SNOMED CT). The inclusion of public health reporting, antimicrobial stewardship, and healthcare disparities demonstrates thorough consideration of broader health system impacts..

They consistently emphasize professional oversight, safety protocols, and appropriate redirections. The policies build on each other logically, from general healthcare principles to specific scenarios like oncology, mental health, and pediatrics. The consistent emphasis on verification, safety checks, and professional consultation creates a strong unified approach.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, including mental health, pediatrics, oncology, infectious diseases, medication management, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both routine and crisis scenarios, considers cultural aspects, and covers technical requirements (ICD-11, SNOMED CT). The inclusion of public health reporting, antimicrobial stewardship, and healthcare disparities demonstrates thorough consideration of broader health system impacts.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs (particularly regarding vulnerable populations in #18 and #20, and aspects of medication management), most redundancies appear intentional and serve to reinforce critical safety measures. The overlap in verification protocols across different medical contexts provides appropriate redundancy for safety-critical areas. However, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising safety.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are clearly actionable and provide specific implementation guidance. They balance security with usability by including structured questioning protocols and verification steps. The policies are adaptable to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The emphasis on explicit professional consultation paths and educational frameworks makes them highly implementable in real-world scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 68) SHOULD detect when healthcare decision queries involve cultural or religious considerations and auto...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST identify healthcare decision support requests that involve reproductive health, mental health c...\n  - [3] (Score: 83) MUST initiate clarification protocols when mental health decision support queries contain crisis ind...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
