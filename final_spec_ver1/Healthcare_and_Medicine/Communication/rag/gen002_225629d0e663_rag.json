    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical communication from multiple complementary angles. They flow naturally from general communication principles (SPEC 5) to specific scenarios (SPEC 13, 14), while maintaining consistent emphasis on safety, professional consultation, and cultural sensitivity. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection against misuse while promoting appropriate healthcare guidance.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare communication risks, including drug interactions (SPEC 2, 3, 10), mental health (SPEC 14), cultural sensitivity (SPEC 1, 8), reproductive health (SPEC 6, 11), and end-of-life care (SPEC 13). It addresses both direct and indirect risks (SPEC 4), while covering technical, cultural, and emotional aspects of healthcare communication. The only minor gap might be in emergency medical situations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show strategic redundancy in critical areas like medication safety (SPEC 2, 3, 10, 15) and reproductive health (SPEC 6, 11), while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There is some overlap between SPEC 7 and SPEC 18 regarding medical statement qualification, but this reinforces important safety principles. The redundancy appears intentional and protective rather than wasteful.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific triggers for different responses. They balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like educational content) when direct medical advice is inappropriate. The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and communication scenarios, with practical guidance for implementation."
