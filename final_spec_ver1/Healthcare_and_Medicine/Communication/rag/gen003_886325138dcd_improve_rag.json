    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive healthcare communication framework. They consistently emphasize patient safety, professional consultation, and cultural sensitivity while maintaining clear boundaries between education and clinical advice. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection around sensitive medical topics.",
    "coverage": "The group addresses a wide range of healthcare scenarios including medication interactions, mental health, reproductive health, cultural considerations, and end-of-life care. It covers both direct and indirect risks (e.g., masked attempts to obtain controlled substances) and includes provisions for PII protection. The only minor gap might be in emergency medical situation handling.",
    "redundancy": "There are several instances of direct duplication (specs 15/16, 17/18/19 appear twice) which reduces efficiency. However, some beneficial redundancy exists in areas requiring multiple layers of protection (medication safety, reproductive health). The redundancy score is reduced due to these unnecessary duplications, though the overlaps don't severely impact functionality.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are clearly written and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives rather than just restrictions. The requirements for cultural competency and accessible language demonstrate real-world applicability. Implementation would require sophisticated natural language processing but remains feasible."
