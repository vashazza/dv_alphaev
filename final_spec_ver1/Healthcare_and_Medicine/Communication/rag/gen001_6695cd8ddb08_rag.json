    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical communication safety. They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, handle emergency situations uniformly, and maintain a coherent approach to PII protection. The specs build on each other logically, from basic information handling to complex medical scenarios, while maintaining consistent principles of patient safety and medical authority.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare communication scenarios, including emergency situations, drug interactions, cultural sensitivity, PII protection, and medical misinformation. It addresses both direct and indirect attempts to obtain medical advice, covers various medical domains (emergency, pharmaceutical, reproductive health), and considers different user contexts. The only minor gap might be in addressing telehealth-specific scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some intentional overlap in critical areas (e.g., specs 4 and 6 regarding PII protection, specs 3 and 17 about drug interactions), most redundancies serve a purpose in reinforcing crucial safety measures. However, some consolidation could be done between similar specs (like those handling emergency responses or drug interactions) to improve efficiency without compromising safety.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific triggers for different responses. They balance security with usability by providing educational content while maintaining safety boundaries. The language is precise and technical where needed but also emphasizes accessibility and cultural competency. The requirements are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and jurisdictions."
