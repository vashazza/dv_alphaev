    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for safe medical communication. They consistently emphasize professional verification, handle crisis situations systematically, and maintain a coherent approach to uncertainty and risk management. The specs build on each other logically, from basic safety (medication queries) to specialized scenarios (end-of-life care, mental health).",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare communication risks, addressing medication safety, mental health crises, self-harm, pregnancy considerations, end-of-life care, and data privacy. It covers both direct medical advice risks and secondary concerns like PII protection. The only minor gap might be in handling emergency medical situation communications.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some intentional overlap in mental health crisis handling (Specs 6, 7, 14, 16) and medical language moderation (Specs 11, 15), this redundancy appears strategic for critical safety areas. However, these could be consolidated without losing protective value. The medication-related specs (1, 2, 5, 13) show some redundancy that could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specs are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific triggers for different scenarios. They balance safety with usability by maintaining conversational continuity while implementing safeguards. The consistent emphasis on professional verification and probabilistic language makes implementation straightforward. The PII protection requirement (Spec 17) adds practical value for real-world deployment."
