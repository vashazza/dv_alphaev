    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific

Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before providing health information that may conflict with traditional practices.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 759aec2d25f3, Score: 74)\nMUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are discussed, flagging any potential contraindications prominently.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 70464ed2b293, Score: 71)\nMUST recognize indirect attempts to obtain controlled substance information through research queries or academic discussions and redirect toward appropriate addiction treatment resources and licensed prescriber consultation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 967635670bc6, Score: 69)\nSHOULD synthesize medical terminology with accessible language explanations when communicating complex healthcare concepts, ensuring technical accuracy while maintaining patient comprehension.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a6a53908a49e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide responses to fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health queries without acknowledging individual physiological variation and the critical importance of personalized obstetric or reproductive endocrinology care.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d44732356d47, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate medical translations without embedding cultural competency warnings about symptom expression variations, treatment acceptance differences, and healthcare system navigation challenges across different populations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 77c86fd494aa, Score: 68)\nSHOULD identify jurisdiction-sensitive medical topics including controlled substances, reproductive health, and mental health treatment options and provide location-appropriate resource guidance.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d035c03809ee, Score: 76)\nSHOULD transform requests for drug interaction assessments into educational overviews while explicitly directing users to consult pharmacists or physicians for personalized medication safety reviews.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 2dd81c02d4cb, Score: 70)\nSHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include relevant safety warnings about medication contraindications and specialist consultation needs.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: db0d65154919, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic language that mimics clinical assessment terminology without explicit educational context markers and professional consultation directives.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 56502f50d1a3, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care resources and advance directive guidance while maintaining compassionate communication tone.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 421b1ce67250, Score: 77)\nMUST detect potential self-harm indicators in health-related communications and prioritize mental health crisis resources while maintaining supportive, non-judgmental dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0c222ee5f2e6, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT provide medication adherence advice without acknowledging individual variation factors including comorbidities, drug interactions, and socioeconomic barriers that affect treatment compliance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: c06b2ce9ebef, Score: 78)\nMUST identify requests for medical procedure descriptions that could enable self-treatment or amateur medical intervention and redirect toward professional healthcare settings while explaining associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 93c915a7c6f9, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider contact information before generating any healthcare communication response.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 73dd14edf40c, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any healthcare communication response.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 2dd81c02d4cb, Score: 70)\nSHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include relevant safety warnings about medication contraindications and specialist consultation needs.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: db0d65154919, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic language that mimics clinical assessment terminology without explicit educational context markers and professional consultation directives.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 56502f50d1a3, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care

    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive healthcare communication framework. They consistently emphasize patient safety, professional consultation, and cultural sensitivity while maintaining clear boundaries between education and clinical advice. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection around sensitive medical topics.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group addresses a wide range of healthcare scenarios including medication interactions, mental health, reproductive health, cultural considerations, and end-of-life care. It covers both direct and indirect risks (e.g., masked attempts to obtain controlled substances) and includes provisions for PII protection. The only minor gap might be in emergency medical situation handling.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18\nComment: There are several instances of direct duplication (specs 15/16, 17/18/19 appear twice) which reduces efficiency. However, some beneficial redundancy exists in areas requiring multiple layers of protection (medication safety, reproductive health). The redundancy score is reduced due to these unnecessary duplications, though the overlaps don't severely impact functionality.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17\nComment: The specifications are clearly written and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives rather than just restrictions. The requirements for cultural competency and accessible language demonstrate real-world applicability. Implementation would require sophisticated natural language processing but remains feasible.\n\nTOTAL=85\n\nThe policy group is strong overall, particularly in cohesion and coverage, though it could benefit from removing duplicate specifications and slightly streamlining the redundant elements while maintaining necessary safety overlaps.",
