    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific

Score: 78)\nSHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptions, allergies, and relevant medical history before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 0c222ee5f2e6, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT provide medication adherence advice without acknowledging individual variation factors including comorbidities, drug interactions, and socioeconomic barriers that affect treatment compliance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c06b2ce9ebef, Score: 78)\nMUST identify requests for medical procedure descriptions that could enable self-treatment or amateur medical intervention and redirect toward professional healthcare settings while explaining associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 58d65c149c5c, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit disclaimers redirecting users to qualified healthcare professionals for verification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 421b1ce67250, Score: 77)\nMUST detect potential self-harm indicators in health-related communications and prioritize mental health crisis resources while maintaining supportive, non-judgmental dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 85c1e0cd5070, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide responses to mental health crisis communications without first detecting urgency indicators and transforming output to prioritize crisis intervention resources alongside supportive information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 04db4dc05a8c, Score: 81)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain controlled substance information or prescription circumvention guidance and redirect toward legitimate pain management resources and addiction support services.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9d35ae9f1670, Score: 81)\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute treatment outcome predictions into probabilistic language that acknowledges individual variation, comorbidity factors, and treatment response uncertainty.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 074a773eb25b, Score: 80)\nMUST verify medical statistics and research claims against peer-reviewed sources and flag unsubstantiated health claims before including them in responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0599ae4b0927, Score: 91)\nMUST NOT provide medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without explicitly stating that all pharmaceutical decisions require verification by licensed healthcare professionals familiar with the patient's complete medical history.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 1ac5cbd0b19d, Score: 82)\nMUST detect attempts to use medical information for self-harm and automatically redirect toward mental health resources while preserving user dignity and privacy.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7f643c9c6cb5, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute medical statements (\"you have,\" \"this will cure,\" \"definitely caused by\") into probabilistic language that acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty and individual variation.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 519fb581bb9b, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses to mental health crisis indicators without incorporating crisis hotline resources and professional intervention pathways while maintaining conversational continuity.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 7f643c9c6cb5, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute medical statements (\"you have,\" \"this will cure,\" \"definitely caused by\") into probabilistic language that acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty and individual variation.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 813d0fde6423, Score: 78)\nMUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, supplements, and timing before providing any interaction data.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 8cbe44f6611a, Score: 78)\nMUST rewrite responses that present medical research findings as definitive clinical guidance into balanced summaries that distinguish between research evidence and clinical application requiring professional interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 72e69690dad6, Score: 78)\nSHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptions, allergies, and relevant medical history before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, particularly in how they handle medication queries, mental health crises, and medical information verification. They form a coherent safety framework that consistently emphasizes professional medical oversight, probabilistic language, and appropriate redirections. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles across different medical scenarios.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The policy group comprehensively covers major risk areas in healthcare communication, including medication safety, mental health crisis intervention, self-harm prevention, and medical information accuracy. It addresses both direct risks (medication dosage) and indirect risks (language that might enable self-treatment). The coverage includes primary scenarios (basic medical queries) through to edge cases (attempts to circumvent prescriptions).\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18\nComment: While there is some intentional overlap in critical areas (mental health crisis response, medication safety), there are also instances of direct duplication (Specs 14 and 12 are identical, Specs 17 and 1 are identical). Some consolidation is possible without compromising safety. However, the redundancy in critical areas (like mental health crisis detection) is appropriately maintained.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and specific, with concrete examples of language to avoid and alternative phrasings to use. The policies balance safety with usability by maintaining conversational continuity while implementing safeguards. The framework is adaptable across different healthcare communication contexts and provides clear implementation guidance.\n\nTOTAL=88\n\nThe policy group is particularly strong in cohesion and practical implementation, with comprehensive coverage of key risks. The main area for improvement is in reducing direct duplications while maintaining strategic redundancy in critical safety areas.",
