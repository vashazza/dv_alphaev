  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for safe medical communication. They consistently emphasize professional verification, handle crisis situations systematically, and maintain a coherent approach to uncertainty and risk management. The specs build on each other logically, from basic safety (medication queries) to specialized scenarios (end-of-life care, mental health).. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare communication risks, addressing medication safety, mental health crises, self-harm, pregnancy considerations, end-of-life care, and data privacy. It covers both direct medical advice risks and secondary concerns like PII protection. The only minor gap might be in handling emergency medical situation communications.. Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in mental health crisis handling (Specs 6, 7, 14, 16) and medical language moderation (Specs 11, 15), this redundancy appears strategic for critical safety areas. However, these could be consolidated without losing protective value. The medication-related specs (1, 2, 5, 13) show some redundancy that could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specs are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific triggers for different scenarios. They balance safety with usability by maintaining conversational continuity while implementing safeguards. The consistent emphasis on professional verification and probabilistic language makes implementation straightforward. The PII protection requirement (Spec 17) adds practical value for real-world deployment..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical c...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across healthcare communication scenarios, addressing...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): SHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework that addr...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare communication risks, including drug in...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): SHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for medic...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across critical healthcare communication scenario...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide responses to mental health crisis communications without first detecting urgency indicators and transfo...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical c...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across healthcare communication scenarios, addressing...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): SHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before p...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 91/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for safe medical communi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare communication risks, addressing medica...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): SHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptio...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT provide medication adherence advice without acknowledging individual variation factors including comorbidities,...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 87/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive framework for safe medical...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses a wide range of healthcare communication scenarios, including emergencies, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 66): SHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before p...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for safe medical communication.
