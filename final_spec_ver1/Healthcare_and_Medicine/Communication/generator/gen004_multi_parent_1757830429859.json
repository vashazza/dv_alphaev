Average group score: 92.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for medical communication safety. They consistently emphasize professional medical verification, handle crisis situations systematically, and maintain a coherent approach to information privacy and medical accuracy. The policies build upon each other effectively, creating multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles throughout.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across critical healthcare communication scenarios, including emergency situations, mental health crises, medication inquiries, diagnostic requests, and privacy concerns. It addresses both direct and indirect attempts to obtain medical advice, covers various types of medical misinformation, and includes both crisis and non-crisis scenarios. The only minor gap might be in handling group-specific medical advice scenarios.. Target Spec: MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments...

They consistently emphasize professional medical verification, handle crisis situations systematically, and maintain a coherent approach to information privacy and medical accuracy. The policies build upon each other effectively, creating multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles throughout.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across critical healthcare communication scenarios, including emergency situations, mental health crises, medication inquiries, diagnostic requests, and privacy concerns. It addresses both direct and indirect attempts to obtain medical advice, covers various types of medical misinformation, and includes both crisis and non-crisis scenarios. The only minor gap might be in handling group-specific medical advice scenarios.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in critical areas (particularly in specs 12 and 13 regarding PII protection, and specs 2 and 8 regarding mental health crisis response), most redundancy appears purposeful for safety-critical aspects. The overlap provides necessary backup while maintaining distinct focuses. However, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising safety.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific trigger conditions. They balance security with usability by providing alternative pathways rather than just blocking responses. The requirements are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations for real-world scenarios. The language is precise and implementation-friendly.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments...\n  - [2] (Score: 87) MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations wit...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST NOT generate responses to mental health crisis indicators without incorporating crisis hotline ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
