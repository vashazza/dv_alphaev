  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 92.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical communication safety. They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, handle emergency situations uniformly, and maintain a coherent approach to PII protection. The specs build on each other logically, from basic information handling to complex medical scenarios, while maintaining consistent principles of patient safety and medical authority.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare communication scenarios, including emergency situations, drug interactions, cultural sensitivity, PII protection, and medical misinformation. It addresses both direct and indirect attempts to obtain medical advice, covers various medical domains (emergency, pharmaceutical, reproductive health), and considers different user contexts. The only minor gap might be in addressing telehealth-specific scenarios.. Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in critical areas (e.g., specs 4 and 6 regarding PII protection, specs 3 and 17 about drug interactions), most redundancies serve a purpose in reinforcing crucial safety measures. However, some consolidation could be done between similar specs (like those handling emergency responses or drug interactions) to improve efficiency without compromising safety.. Practicality: The specifications are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific triggers for different responses. They balance security with usability by providing educational content while maintaining safety boundaries. The language is precise and technical where needed but also emphasizes accessibility and cultural competency. The requirements are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and jurisdictions..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical communicatio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare communication scenarios, inclu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 66): SHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before p...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 0/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: No cohesion feedback available\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: No coverage feedback available\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): SHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptio...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT provide medication adherence advice without acknowledging individual variation factors including comorbidities,...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for medic...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates thorough coverage across critical healthcare communication scenarios, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide responses to mental health crisis communications without first detecting urgency indicators and transfo...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical communicatio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare communication scenarios, inclu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST recognize healthcare misinformation patterns including conspiracy theories, unproven treatments, or dangerous healt...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 66): SHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before p...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 0/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: No cohesion feedback available\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: No coverage feedback available\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): SHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptio...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT provide medication adherence advice without acknowledging individual variation factors including comorbidities,...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for medic...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates thorough coverage across critical healthcare communication scenarios, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit discla...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide responses to mental health crisis communications without first detecting urgency indicators and transfo...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical communication safety.
