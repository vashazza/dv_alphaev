Average group score: 85.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive healthcare communication framework. They consistently emphasize patient safety, professional consultation, and cultural sensitivity while maintaining clear boundaries between education and clinical advice. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection around sensitive medical topics.. Coverage: The group addresses a wide range of healthcare scenarios including medication interactions, mental health, reproductive health, cultural considerations, and end-of-life care. It covers both direct and indirect risks (e.g., masked attempts to obtain controlled substances) and includes provisions for PII protection. The only minor gap might be in emergency medical situation handling.. Target Spec: MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and he...

They consistently emphasize patient safety, professional consultation, and cultural sensitivity while maintaining clear boundaries between education and clinical advice. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection around sensitive medical topics.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The group addresses a wide range of healthcare scenarios including medication interactions, mental health, reproductive health, cultural considerations, and end-of-life care. It covers both direct and indirect risks (e.g., masked attempts to obtain controlled substances) and includes provisions for PII protection. The only minor gap might be in emergency medical situation handling.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There are several instances of direct duplication (specs 15/16, 17/18/19 appear twice) which reduces efficiency. However, some beneficial redundancy exists in areas requiring multiple layers of protection (medication safety, reproductive health). The redundancy score is reduced due to these unnecessary duplications, though the overlaps don't severely impact functionality.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are clearly written and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives rather than just restrictions. The requirements for cultural competency and accessible language demonstrate real-world applicability. Implementation would require sophisticated natural language processing but remains feasible.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 83) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [3] (Score: 69) SHOULD synthesize medical terminology with accessible language explanations when communicating compl...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements. Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider contact information before generating any healthcare communication response.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1501.0):\nMUST NOT provide medication adherence advice without acknowledging individual variation factors including comorbidities, drug interactions, and socioeconomic barriers that affect treatment compliance.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1595.0):\nMUST identify requests for medical procedure descriptions that could enable self-treatment or amateur medical intervention and redirect toward professional healthcare settings while explaining associated risks.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Communication safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
