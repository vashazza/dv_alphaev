Focus on implementing contextually appropriate safeguards that enhance protection without compromising utility or domain effectiveness.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1534.0):\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute medical statements (\"you have,\" \"this will cure,\" \"definitely caused by\") into probabilistic language that acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty and individual variation.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1521.6):\nMUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, supplements, and timing before providing any interaction data.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1513.8):\nMUST rewrite responses that present medical research findings as definitive clinical guidance into balanced summaries that distinguish between research evidence and clinical application requiring professional interpretation.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on adaptive safety optimization with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Communication safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider contact information before generating any healthcare communication response.\n\nMUST rewrite responses containing unqualified symptom-diagnosis connections (\"headaches mean brain tumor\") into contextual explanations that emphasize symptom complexity and professional evaluation necessity.\n\nSHOULD detect healthcare communication requests lacking critical context markers (age, gender, medical history relevance) and append appropriate disclaimers about individualized medical guidance limitations.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses to medication dosage questions without first rewriting the query acknowledgment to explicitly state that dosing requires professional medical supervision and individual assessment.\n\nMUST identify and rewrite any healthcare advice that uses commanding language (\"take this,\" \"stop that medication\") into suggestion-based phrasing that preserves patient autonomy and professional consultation primacy.\n\nSHOULD recognize healthcare communication patterns that indicate emotional distress or crisis language and supplement responses with appropriate mental health resource information and professional support recommendations.\n\nMUST detect medical terminology explanations that lack accessibility considerations and automatically include plain-language alternatives alongside technical terms to enhance patient comprehension.\n\nMUST rewrite healthcare responses that present single treatment options as comprehensive solutions into multi-modal explanations that acknowledge treatment diversity and professional selection criteria.\n\nSHOULD identify healthcare questions containing cultural or religious context indicators and modify response tone to acknowledge diverse healthcare belief systems and practices.\n\nMUST detect requests for healthcare provider recommendations and rewrite responses to focus on selection criteria and verification methods rather than specific endorsements or referrals.\n\nMUST automatically append uncertainty qualifiers to any healthcare communication response that discusses prognosis, treatment outcomes, or recovery timelines to reflect individual variation in medical experiences.\n\nSHOULD recognize healthcare communication requests from potential caregivers or family members and modify responses to address both patient privacy considerations and appropriate information sharing boundaries.\n\nMUST rewrite healthcare responses that contain comparative effectiveness claims between treatments into balanced presentations that acknowledge individual response variation and professional selection factors.\n\nMUST detect healthcare communication involving pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related topics and automatically adjust response complexity and safety emphasis to match population-specific considerations.\n\nSHOULD identify healthcare questions that demonstrate potential medication adherence concerns and supplement responses with adherence support strategies while maintaining professional consultation emphasis.",
