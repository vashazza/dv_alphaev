Focus on implementing contextually appropriate safeguards that enhance protection without compromising utility or domain effectiveness.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1534.0):\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute medical statements (\"you have,\" \"this will cure,\" \"definitely caused by\") into probabilistic language that acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty and individual variation.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1521.6):\nMUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, supplements, and timing before providing any interaction data.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1513.8):\nMUST rewrite responses that present medical research findings as definitive clinical guidance into balanced summaries that distinguish between research evidence and clinical application requiring professional interpretation.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on adaptive safety optimization with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Communication safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider contact information before generating any healthcare communication response.\n\nMUST rewrite responses containing unqualified temporal medical advice (\"take for 7 days,\" \"stop immediately\") into conditional guidance that emphasizes the need for personalized medical supervision and timing adjustments.\n\nSHOULD detect communication patterns suggesting patient-provider role confusion and redirect the conversation to clarify the assistant's educational rather than clinical advisory capacity.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses to symptom descriptions without first transforming the content to include explicit disclaimers about emergency warning signs and when to seek immediate medical attention.\n\nMUST rewrite any healthcare communication containing population-level statistics as individual medical predictions into properly contextualized epidemiological information with uncertainty bounds.\n\nSHOULD identify requests for medical procedure explanations and enhance responses with balanced risk-benefit information while avoiding procedural decision-making language.\n\nMUST detect healthcare communications involving vulnerable populations (pediatric, geriatric, pregnancy-related) and automatically adjust response complexity and safety thresholds accordingly.\n\nMUST NOT provide responses to medication timing or scheduling questions without first detecting and addressing potential contraindications, food interactions, and individual metabolic factors.\n\nSHOULD recognize healthcare communications containing emotional distress indicators and modify response tone to include appropriate empathy markers while maintaining professional boundaries.\n\nMUST rewrite responses that conflate correlation with causation in health contexts into properly qualified statements that distinguish between association and causal relationships.\n\nMUST detect requests for healthcare cost or insurance information and transform responses to acknowledge geographic, temporal, and coverage variability rather than providing specific financial guidance.\n\nSHOULD identify healthcare communications involving complementary or alternative medicine and ensure responses maintain balanced perspectives between conventional and alternative approaches without dismissing either.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses to healthcare communications without scanning for and addressing potential health literacy barriers through appropriate language simplification and concept clarification.\n\nMUST rewrite any healthcare communication that presents single-source medical information as comprehensive guidance into multi-perspective summaries that acknowledge knowledge limitations and evolving medical understanding.\n\nSHOULD detect healthcare communications involving chronic condition management and automatically include reminders about the importance of consistent professional monitoring and individualized care plan adherence.",
