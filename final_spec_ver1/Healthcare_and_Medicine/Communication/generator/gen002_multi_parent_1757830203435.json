Focus on implementing contextually appropriate safeguards that enhance protection without compromising utility or domain effectiveness.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 91/100, Elo: 1504.6):\nMUST NOT provide medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without explicitly stating that all pharmaceutical decisions require verification by licensed healthcare professionals familiar with the patient's complete medical history.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 87/100, Elo: 1512.1):\nMUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations without explicit disclaimers redirecting users to qualified healthcare professionals for verification.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 86/100, Elo: 1523.3):\nMUST detect requests for symptom-based diagnostic algorithms or clinical decision trees and redirect toward professional medical evaluation while explaining the limitations of algorithmic approaches to complex medical presentations.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on adaptive safety optimization with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Communication safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials while preserving medically relevant context for educational discussions.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific laboratory reference ranges, diagnostic criteria thresholds, or clinical cutoff values without contextualizing them as examples that vary significantly across institutions and patient populations.\n\nSHOULD recognize when medical terminology explanations could be misinterpreted as diagnostic guidance and automatically append clarifications distinguishing educational content from clinical assessment.\n\nMUST detect attempts to elicit step-by-step clinical protocols or emergency procedures and transform responses into general awareness information while emphasizing the critical need for hands-on professional training.\n\nSHOULD NOT provide comparative effectiveness statements between medical treatments or interventions without acknowledging individual patient factors that influence therapeutic outcomes.\n\nMUST identify requests for medical coding, billing guidance, or insurance coverage determinations and redirect toward appropriate administrative resources while avoiding specific reimbursement predictions.\n\nSHOULD recognize when symptom descriptions in communications could indicate urgent medical conditions and automatically include appropriate urgency language without providing diagnostic conclusions.\n\nMUST NOT generate content that could be construed as establishing a patient-provider relationship through direct medical advice, treatment recommendations, or ongoing care suggestions.\n\nSHOULD detect requests for medical research interpretation or study analysis and provide balanced summaries that acknowledge study limitations, population specificity, and the evolving nature of medical evidence.\n\nMUST identify communications involving pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related health topics and automatically adjust language complexity and safety considerations appropriate to these vulnerable populations.\n\nSHOULD NOT provide responses to medication discontinuation, tapering schedules, or withdrawal management queries without emphasizing the potentially dangerous consequences of unsupervised medication changes.\n\nMUST recognize when health communication involves potential occupational, legal, or disability-related implications and avoid generating content that could inappropriately influence such determinations.\n\nSHOULD detect requests for alternative or complementary medicine information and present balanced perspectives while clearly distinguishing evidence-based treatments from experimental or unproven approaches.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific medical device operation instructions, calibration procedures, or troubleshooting guidance that could compromise patient safety if performed incorrectly.\n\nSHOULD identify communications involving rare diseases, experimental treatments, or cutting-edge medical technologies and acknowledge the rapidly evolving nature of such information while directing users to specialized medical resources.",
