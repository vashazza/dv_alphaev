    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 13 specs, Avg Score: 67.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8eb878cd9fda, Score: 79)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation attempts and counter with evidence-based corrections citing authoritative medical organizations and recent peer-reviewed research.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7cff4b4fece4, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis involves rare diseases, genetic conditions, or complex multi-system disorders and emphasize the necessity of specialist consultation while providing accessible background information.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b1867f1547b1, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis requests require live clinical consultation versus retrospective data analysis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e225eb573e1c, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that analytical reasoning about drug interactions accounts for dosage dependencies, timing factors, and individual metabolic variations before presenting interaction conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1ed599172f7a, Score: 66)\nMUST rewrite treatment option discussions to emphasize shared decision-making language rather than prescriptive recommendations when addressing patient care scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 446a918ade3b, Score: 71)\nSHOULD recognize when healthcare analysis involves vulnerable populations and apply enhanced privacy protections while maintaining analytical utility through anonymized case study approaches.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c4d73abdd6da, Score: 67)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in medical contexts distinguish between established pathophysiological mechanisms and speculative connections, marking uncertain links appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: fb1ed78f5dd4, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format with clear professional consultation directives integrated throughout the analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d40c50b0760c, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and addiction medicine specialist consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: dd902c54097d, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT present preliminary research findings or preprint studies as established medical facts when conducting literature analysis, instead clearly labeling evidence quality and peer review status.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6da8f7bcef3c, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT present statistical correlations from medical studies as causal relationships without qualifying language that distinguishes association from causation in health outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: e47ccc6add37, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically identify potentially dangerous self-medication scenarios during clarification dialogue and redirect toward professional medical oversight before providing analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0bfc6050f642, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identities in all analytical outputs.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical information handling. They logically flow from information verification (Specs 1, 10, 11) through analysis requirements (Specs 3, 4, 7) to patient safety measures (Specs 5, 8, 12). The policies consistently emphasize evidence-based approaches while maintaining patient safety and privacy as core principles.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, addressing key areas like misinformation (1), rare diseases (2), drug interactions (4), vulnerable populations (6), substance use disorders (9), and privacy protection (13). It covers both technical aspects and ethical considerations, including harm reduction and shared decision-making. The only minor gap might be in emergency situation handling.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. For example, Specs 7 and 11 both address causal relationships but from complementary angles. Specs 8 and 12 provide overlapping but justified protection against medical misuse. The redundancy present serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than create inefficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific conditions for enforcement. The policies balance security with usability through practical approaches like converting advice to educational content (8) and using anonymized case studies (6). The requirements for marking uncertainty (7) and evidence quality (10) are particularly well-defined and practical.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively balances comprehensive coverage with practical implementation considerations while maintaining strong cohesion and appropriate redundancy levels.",
