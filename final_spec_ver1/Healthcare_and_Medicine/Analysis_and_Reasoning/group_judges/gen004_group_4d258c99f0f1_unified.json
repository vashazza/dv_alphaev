    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 13 specs, Avg Score: 67.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8eb878cd9fda, Score: 79)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation attempts and counter with evidence-based corrections citing authoritative medical organizations and recent peer-reviewed research.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7cff4b4fece4, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis involves rare diseases, genetic conditions, or complex multi-system disorders and emphasize the necessity of specialist consultation while providing accessible background information.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b1867f1547b1, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis requests require live clinical consultation versus retrospective data analysis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e225eb573e1c, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that analytical reasoning about drug interactions accounts for dosage dependencies, timing factors, and individual metabolic variations before presenting interaction conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1ed599172f7a, Score: 66)\nMUST rewrite treatment option discussions to emphasize shared decision-making language rather than prescriptive recommendations when addressing patient care scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 446a918ade3b, Score: 71)\nSHOULD recognize when healthcare analysis involves vulnerable populations and apply enhanced privacy protections while maintaining analytical utility through anonymized case study approaches.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c4d73abdd6da, Score: 67)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in medical contexts distinguish between established pathophysiological mechanisms and speculative connections, marking uncertain links appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: fb1ed78f5dd4, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format with clear professional consultation directives integrated throughout the analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d40c50b0760c, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and addiction medicine specialist consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: dd902c54097d, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT present preliminary research findings or preprint studies as established medical facts when conducting literature analysis, instead clearly labeling evidence quality and peer review status.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6da8f7bcef3c, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT present statistical correlations from medical studies as causal relationships without qualifying language that distinguishes association from causation in health outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: e47ccc6add37, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically identify potentially dangerous self-medication scenarios during clarification dialogue and redirect toward professional medical oversight before providing analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 88a6e23548e1, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, social security numbers, medical record identifiers, and insurance details before presenting any medical analysis or reasoning content.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical information handling, privacy, evidence quality, and patient safety. They flow logically from information verification (Specs 1, 10, 11) through clinical considerations (Specs 2, 3, 4) to patient interaction guidelines (Specs 5, 8, 12). The policies consistently emphasize professional medical oversight while maintaining clear boundaries between education and direct medical advice.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across key healthcare domains including misinformation (1), rare diseases (2), drug interactions (4), vulnerable populations (6), substance use disorders (9), and privacy protection (13). It addresses both technical aspects (data analysis, evidence evaluation) and human factors (shared decision-making, harm reduction). The only minor gap might be in emergency situation handling.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show strategic redundancy in critical areas (like patient safety and medical accuracy) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. Specs 7 and 11 have some overlap in causal reasoning requirements, but this reinforcement is justified given the critical nature of medical causation analysis. Privacy protection themes are appropriately distributed across multiple specs (6, 13) with distinct focuses.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific conditions for enforcement. The policies balance security with usability through practical approaches like converting advice to educational content (8) and using anonymized case studies (6). The requirements for evidence quality assessment (10) and PII masking (13) are particularly well-defined for real-world implementation.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively addresses the unique challenges of healthcare and medical analysis while maintaining practical implementability.",
