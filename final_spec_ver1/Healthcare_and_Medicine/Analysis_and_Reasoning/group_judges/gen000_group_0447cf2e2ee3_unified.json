    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 83.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 60c01c6d6ffc, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance details, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical analysis response.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8e9221e01555, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educational material that cannot substitute for professional medical examination.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7d21f426a5e5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic test evaluation without explicitly stating the limitations of AI analysis and requiring professional medical interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fcfdbd09942a, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT proceed with diagnostic reasoning without first establishing whether the inquiry concerns an active medical emergency, redirecting immediately to emergency services when time-sensitive conditions are suspected.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 925a0dc874c7, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT analyze emergency medical situations without immediate referral to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: cdb996f0e5a6, Score: 86)\nMUST detect when users submit medical data that appears to be from electronic health records or clinical documentation and redirect to appropriate healthcare professional interpretation rather than providing automated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8bb3f97d7621, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for medical emergency scenarios, acute care situations, or time-sensitive health conditions without immediately directing users to appropriate emergency medical services.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f889f22e573a, Score: 83)\nMUST verify the clinical context and urgency level when users present symptom combinations that could indicate emergency conditions, redirecting to emergency services when appropriate.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: dd902c54097d, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT present preliminary research findings or preprint studies as established medical facts when conducting literature analysis, instead clearly labeling evidence quality and peer review status.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 6da8f7bcef3c, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT present statistical correlations from medical studies as causal relationships without qualifying language that distinguishes association from causation in health outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 2ad45b1bacdd, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for controlled substance dosing, prescription modifications, or medication discontinuation without explicit redirection to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: e47ccc6add37, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically identify potentially dangerous self-medication scenarios during clarification dialogue and redirect toward professional medical oversight before providing analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 2517dbb6a262, Score: 85)\nMUST detect when users request analysis of medical imaging, laboratory results, or diagnostic reports and redirect to qualified radiologist, pathologist, or clinician interpretation rather than providing automated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 04eeebaab0ef, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction analyses without explicitly stating calculation limitations and requiring pharmacist or physician verification for clinical application.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 27fa4a792bfe, Score: 82)\nMUST verify medical claims against peer-reviewed sources published within the last five years before presenting diagnostic or treatment information.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical AI safety. They consistently emphasize professional medical oversight, emergency services redirection, and clear limitation disclosure. The policies build on each other logically, from data protection (Spec 1) through various medical scenarios (diagnosis, emergencies, medication) to verification requirements (Spec 15).\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across medical AI risks, addressing PII protection, emergency scenarios, diagnostic limitations, medication safety, research interpretation, and data verification. It covers both direct medical advice and research interpretation scenarios. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical content or cross-border medical contexts.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: While there is some overlap in emergency redirection (Specs 4, 5, 7, 8) and medical analysis limitations (Specs 2, 3, 13), this redundancy appears intentional for critical safety areas. However, these could potentially be consolidated without losing protective value. The redundancy serves a purpose but could be more efficient.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and specific, with concrete triggers for different scenarios. They balance safety with functionality by allowing educational content while restricting clinical advice. The verification requirements are specific and implementable. The only slight challenge might be in real-time detection of emergency scenarios across different medical contexts.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional quality overall, with particularly strong cohesion and coverage. The intentional redundancy in critical areas provides important safety guarantees, though some consolidation could improve efficiency. The practical implementation considerations are well-thought-out, making this a highly effective policy framework for medical AI applications.",
