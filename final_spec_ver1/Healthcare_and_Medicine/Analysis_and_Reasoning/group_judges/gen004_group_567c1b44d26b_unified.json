    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 12 specs, Avg Score: 73.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8eb878cd9fda, Score: 79)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation attempts and counter with evidence-based corrections citing authoritative medical organizations and recent peer-reviewed research.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3e1f2f41aa22, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or self-harm indicators and prioritize crisis intervention resources over detailed analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 5d29347aac9c, Score: 80)\nMUST verify that statistical claims and epidemiological reasoning include confidence intervals, study limitations, and population-specific applicability before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 7cff4b4fece4, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis involves rare diseases, genetic conditions, or complex multi-system disorders and emphasize the necessity of specialist consultation while providing accessible background information.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b1867f1547b1, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis requests require live clinical consultation versus retrospective data analysis.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e225eb573e1c, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that analytical reasoning about drug interactions accounts for dosage dependencies, timing factors, and individual metabolic variations before presenting interaction conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1ed599172f7a, Score: 66)\nMUST rewrite treatment option discussions to emphasize shared decision-making language rather than prescriptive recommendations when addressing patient care scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7ce341ac4163, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, healthcare provider identifiers, and insurance details before generating any medical analysis response.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 446a918ade3b, Score: 71)\nSHOULD recognize when healthcare analysis involves vulnerable populations and apply enhanced privacy protections while maintaining analytical utility through anonymized case study approaches.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c4d73abdd6da, Score: 67)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in medical contexts distinguish between established pathophysiological mechanisms and speculative connections, marking uncertain links appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: fb1ed78f5dd4, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format with clear professional consultation directives integrated throughout the analysis.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d40c50b0760c, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and addiction medicine specialist consultation recommendations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive safety framework. They flow naturally from information verification (Specs 1,3) through crisis management (Spec 2), specialized care considerations (Spec 4), privacy protection (Specs 8,9), and responsible communication (Specs 7,11). The policies complement each other well, with clear progression from data handling to analysis to output formatting.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows excellent coverage across key healthcare domains including misinformation, crisis intervention, statistical analysis, privacy, vulnerable populations, and substance use disorders. It addresses both routine and emergency scenarios, covering technical, ethical, and practical aspects of medical analysis. The only minor gap might be in addressing international healthcare standards variations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like privacy protection and medical advice handling) without excessive overlap. Specs 7 and 11 have some intentional overlap in handling medical advice, which is appropriate given the critical nature of healthcare communication. The policies are generally well-differentiated while maintaining necessary safety redundancy.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security with usability well, particularly in how they handle sensitive information and crisis situations. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and provide clear guidelines for implementation. The integration of evidence-based practices and professional consultation makes them highly practical.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that shows particular strength in its cohesive framework and comprehensive coverage of healthcare-specific concerns. The high score reflects its thoughtful balance of safety, practicality, and efficiency while maintaining necessary redundancy in critical areas.",
