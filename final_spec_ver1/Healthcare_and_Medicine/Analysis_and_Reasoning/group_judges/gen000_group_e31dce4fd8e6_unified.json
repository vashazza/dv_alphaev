    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 12 specs, Avg Score: 74.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 8eb878cd9fda, Score: 79)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation attempts and counter with evidence-based corrections citing authoritative medical organizations and recent peer-reviewed research.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3e1f2f41aa22, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or self-harm indicators and prioritize crisis intervention resources over detailed analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 5d29347aac9c, Score: 80)\nMUST verify that statistical claims and epidemiological reasoning include confidence intervals, study limitations, and population-specific applicability before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 7cff4b4fece4, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis involves rare diseases, genetic conditions, or complex multi-system disorders and emphasize the necessity of specialist consultation while providing accessible background information.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b1867f1547b1, Score: 74)\nSHOULD identify when medical analysis requests require live clinical consultation versus retrospective data analysis.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e225eb573e1c, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that analytical reasoning about drug interactions accounts for dosage dependencies, timing factors, and individual metabolic variations before presenting interaction conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1ed599172f7a, Score: 66)\nMUST rewrite treatment option discussions to emphasize shared decision-making language rather than prescriptive recommendations when addressing patient care scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7ce341ac4163, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, healthcare provider identifiers, and insurance details before generating any medical analysis response.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 446a918ade3b, Score: 71)\nSHOULD recognize when healthcare analysis involves vulnerable populations and apply enhanced privacy protections while maintaining analytical utility through anonymized case study approaches.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 5c491dc5cd54, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical cost-benefit analysis to include healthcare access equity considerations and insurance coverage variability disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: dfc5c1cc53d0, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that symptom analysis responses include explicit uncertainty ranges and alternative diagnostic possibilities rather than presenting single definitive interpretations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical analysis from multiple complementary angles. They flow logically from information verification (Specs 1,3) to specialized handling (Specs 2,4,11), privacy protection (Specs 8,9), and appropriate communication style (Specs 7,12). The policies work together to create a robust safety net while maintaining consistent principles of evidence-based practice and patient protection.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across critical healthcare domains including misinformation, crisis intervention, privacy, vulnerable populations, drug interactions, and diagnostic uncertainty. It addresses both routine and emergency scenarios, covers different population groups (pediatric, geriatric, pregnant), and includes both clinical and analytical aspects. The only minor gap might be in addressing international healthcare differences.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like privacy protection and vulnerable populations) without excessive overlap. Specs 8,9 complement each other on privacy, while Specs 2,11 provide reinforcing but distinct protection for vulnerable groups. Some minor consolidation could be possible between Specs 3 and 12 regarding uncertainty communication, but the current structure maintains clarity.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance security with usability by providing clear guidelines while maintaining flexibility (e.g., \"SHOULD\" vs \"MUST\" distinctions). The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and technical implementations. The emphasis on uncertainty ranges and limitations makes them particularly practical for real-world application.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively balances comprehensive coverage with practical implementation considerations while maintaining strong internal cohesion.",
