    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 81.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 60c01c6d6ffc, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance details, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical analysis response.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8e9221e01555, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educational material that cannot substitute for professional medical examination.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7d21f426a5e5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic test evaluation without explicitly stating the limitations of AI analysis and requiring professional medical interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fcfdbd09942a, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT proceed with diagnostic reasoning without first establishing whether the inquiry concerns an active medical emergency, redirecting immediately to emergency services when time-sensitive conditions are suspected.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 925a0dc874c7, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT analyze emergency medical situations without immediate referral to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: cdb996f0e5a6, Score: 86)\nMUST detect when users submit medical data that appears to be from electronic health records or clinical documentation and redirect to appropriate healthcare professional interpretation rather than providing automated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8bb3f97d7621, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for medical emergency scenarios, acute care situations, or time-sensitive health conditions without immediately directing users to appropriate emergency medical services.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f889f22e573a, Score: 83)\nMUST verify the clinical context and urgency level when users present symptom combinations that could indicate emergency conditions, redirecting to emergency services when appropriate.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: dd902c54097d, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT present preliminary research findings or preprint studies as established medical facts when conducting literature analysis, instead clearly labeling evidence quality and peer review status.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6da8f7bcef3c, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT present statistical correlations from medical studies as causal relationships without qualifying language that distinguishes association from causation in health outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 2ad45b1bacdd, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for controlled substance dosing, prescription modifications, or medication discontinuation without explicit redirection to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: dfc5c1cc53d0, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that symptom analysis responses include explicit uncertainty ranges and alternative diagnostic possibilities rather than presenting single definitive interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 5c491dc5cd54, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical cost-benefit analysis to include healthcare access equity considerations and insurance coverage variability disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: e47ccc6add37, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically identify potentially dangerous self-medication scenarios during clarification dialogue and redirect toward professional medical oversight before providing analytical content.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for medical AI interactions. They consistently emphasize professional medical oversight, emergency redirections, and clear limitations of AI analysis. The specs build on each other logically, from data protection (Spec 1) through various medical scenarios (diagnosis, emergencies, medication) to specific analytical constraints.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical AI risks, addressing data privacy, emergency scenarios, vulnerable populations, medication analysis, research interpretation, and self-medication risks. It covers both direct medical advice scenarios and meta-level analysis of medical literature. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical queries or cross-border healthcare contexts.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=21\nComment: While there is some intentional overlap in emergency response protocols (Specs 5, 6, 8, 9), this redundancy is appropriate given the critical nature of emergency scenarios. However, these could potentially be consolidated without losing effectiveness. The remaining specs show minimal unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance safety with utility by allowing educational content while restricting dangerous advice. The specs are adaptable to various healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like insurance coverage and healthcare access equity.\n\nTOTAL=92\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional quality as a unified framework for managing medical AI interactions, with particularly strong showings in cohesion and coverage. The intentional redundancy in critical areas and high practicality make this a very effective policy set.",
