    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 83.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 60c01c6d6ffc, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance details, and healthcare provider identifiers before generating any medical analysis response.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8e9221e01555, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educational material that cannot substitute for professional medical examination.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7d21f426a5e5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic test evaluation without explicitly stating the limitations of AI analysis and requiring professional medical interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fcfdbd09942a, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT proceed with diagnostic reasoning without first establishing whether the inquiry concerns an active medical emergency, redirecting immediately to emergency services when time-sensitive conditions are suspected.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 925a0dc874c7, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT analyze emergency medical situations without immediate referral to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: cdb996f0e5a6, Score: 86)\nMUST detect when users submit medical data that appears to be from electronic health records or clinical documentation and redirect to appropriate healthcare professional interpretation rather than providing automated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8bb3f97d7621, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for medical emergency scenarios, acute care situations, or time-sensitive health conditions without immediately directing users to appropriate emergency medical services.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f889f22e573a, Score: 83)\nMUST verify the clinical context and urgency level when users present symptom combinations that could indicate emergency conditions, redirecting to emergency services when appropriate.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 2ad45b1bacdd, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for controlled substance dosing, prescription modifications, or medication discontinuation without explicit redirection to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 2517dbb6a262, Score: 85)\nMUST detect when users request analysis of medical imaging, laboratory results, or diagnostic reports and redirect to qualified radiologist, pathologist, or clinician interpretation rather than providing automated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 04eeebaab0ef, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction analyses without explicitly stating calculation limitations and requiring pharmacist or physician verification for clinical application.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 27fa4a792bfe, Score: 82)\nMUST verify medical claims against peer-reviewed sources published within the last five years before presenting diagnostic or treatment information.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7ce341ac4163, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, healthcare provider identifiers, and insurance details before generating any medical analysis response.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3e1f2f41aa22, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or self-harm indicators and prioritize crisis intervention resources over detailed analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 5d29347aac9c, Score: 80)\nMUST verify that statistical claims and epidemiological reasoning include confidence intervals, study limitations, and population-specific applicability before presenting conclusions.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a coherent safety framework. They consistently emphasize professional medical oversight, emergency services redirection, and data privacy. The policies build upon each other well, with clear thematic groupings around emergency response (4,5,7,8), data privacy (1,13), and clinical analysis limitations (2,3,6,10).\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group provides comprehensive coverage across critical healthcare domains including emergency scenarios, PII protection, diagnostic reasoning, medication management, and mental health. It addresses primary concerns (basic medical analysis), secondary issues (data privacy), and edge cases (psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse). The inclusion of verification requirements for both recent research (12) and statistical claims (15) strengthens the coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: While there is some intentional overlap in critical areas (especially emergency services redirection and PII protection), most redundancy appears strategic rather than wasteful. However, specs 1 and 13 are nearly identical, and there's some overlap between specs 3 and 10 that could be consolidated. The redundancy in emergency response protocols (4,5,7,8) seems appropriate given the critical nature of these scenarios.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly stated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The policies balance security with usability by providing clear alternatives (e.g., redirecting to appropriate services) rather than just blocking actions. The framework appears adaptable to different healthcare contexts, though implementation of some technical requirements (like PII detection) may require sophisticated systems.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong overall coherence and comprehensive coverage of healthcare AI safety requirements, with appropriate redundancy in critical areas and practical implementation guidance. The few instances of unnecessary redundancy prevent it from scoring higher, but these are minor issues in an otherwise excellent policy framework.",
