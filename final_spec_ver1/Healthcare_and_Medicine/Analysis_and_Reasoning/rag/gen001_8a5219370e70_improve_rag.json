    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for medical AI interactions. They consistently emphasize professional medical oversight, emergency redirections, and clear limitations of AI analysis. The specs build on each other logically, from data protection (Spec 1) through various medical scenarios (diagnosis, emergencies, medication) to specific analytical constraints.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical AI risks, addressing data privacy, emergency situations, vulnerable populations, medication analysis, research interpretation, and self-medication scenarios. It covers both direct medical advice and meta-analysis of medical literature. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical queries or cross-border healthcare scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some intentional overlap in emergency response protocols (Specs 5, 6, 8, 9), this redundancy is appropriate given the critical nature of emergency scenarios. However, there could be some consolidation of emergency-related specs to improve efficiency without compromising safety. The redundancy serves a protective purpose but could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance safety with utility by allowing educational content while restricting dangerous advice. The specs are adaptable to various healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like insurance coverage and healthcare access equity. The automated detection requirements are realistic and technically feasible."
