    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical analysis safety from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical flow from data privacy (Spec 11) to verification requirements (Specs 1, 3, 8) to crisis intervention (Spec 4) to communication standards (Spec 10). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles of medical authority and evidence-based practice.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical analysis scenarios, including routine diagnostics, emergencies, rare conditions, drug interactions, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both technical aspects (data handling, verification) and human factors (crisis intervention, shared decision-making). The only minor gap might be in addressing real-time system failures or technical emergency protocols.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like verification requirements and safety checks) without excessive overlap. While Specs 3 and 5 both address verification of medical claims, they focus on different aspects (temporal relevance vs. statistical validity). Specs 11 and 12 complement each other in privacy protection rather than duplicate efforts.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific criteria for verification, data handling, and response generation. The balance between automation and human oversight is well-considered, and the specs accommodate different healthcare contexts. The use of MUST/SHOULD distinctions helps prioritize implementation efforts appropriately."
