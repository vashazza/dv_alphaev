    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical analysis safety. They consistently emphasize uncertainty quantification, professional consultation requirements, and the conversion of advice to educational content. The policies build on each other logically, from general medical reasoning (Specs 3-5) to specific scenarios like drug interactions (Spec 7) and mental health (Spec 11), creating a well-integrated safety net.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical domains, addressing general medical reasoning, specific high-risk areas (mental health, pregnancy, drug interactions), vulnerable populations, and emergency scenarios. It covers both common and edge cases, from routine analysis to crisis situations. The inclusion of source verification (Spec 12) and database cross-checking (Spec 7) strengthens the coverage of information quality control.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some intentional overlap in safety-critical areas (e.g., Specs 8 and 9 both address converting medical advice to educational content), most redundancy is purposeful and reinforcing. However, some consolidation could be beneficial, particularly between Specs 8 and 9. The redundancy in professional consultation requirements across multiple specs serves as an appropriate safety reinforcement.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific requirements for implementation. They balance safety with usability by providing alternative actions (e.g., converting to educational content rather than simply blocking responses). The requirements for database checking and source verification might be resource-intensive but are necessary for safety. The emergency protocols are particularly well-defined and practical."
