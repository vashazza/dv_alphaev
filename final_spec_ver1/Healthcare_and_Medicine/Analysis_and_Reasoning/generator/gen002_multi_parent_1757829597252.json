Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical analysis safety from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical flow from data privacy (Spec 11) to verification requirements (Specs 1, 3, 8) to crisis intervention (Spec 4) to communication standards (Spec 10). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles of medical authority and evidence-based practice.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical analysis scenarios, including routine diagnostics, emergencies, rare conditions, drug interactions, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both technical aspects (data handling, verification) and human factors (crisis intervention, shared decision-making). The only minor gap might be in addressing real-time system failures or technical emergency protocols..

There's a clear logical flow from data privacy (Spec 11) to verification requirements (Specs 1, 3, 8) to crisis intervention (Spec 4) to communication standards (Spec 10). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles of medical authority and evidence-based practice.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical analysis scenarios, including routine diagnostics, emergencies, rare conditions, drug interactions, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both technical aspects (data handling, verification) and human factors (crisis intervention, shared decision-making). The only minor gap might be in addressing real-time system failures or technical emergency protocols.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like verification requirements and safety checks) without excessive overlap. While Specs 3 and 5 both address verification of medical claims, they focus on different aspects (temporal relevance vs. statistical validity). Specs 11 and 12 complement each other in privacy protection rather than duplicate efforts.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific criteria for verification, data handling, and response generation. The balance between automation and human oversight is well-considered, and the specs accommodate different healthcare contexts. The use of MUST/SHOULD distinctions helps prioritize implementation efforts appropriately.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 66) MUST rewrite treatment option discussions to emphasize shared decision-making language rather than p...\n  - [2] (Score: 86) MUST detect when users submit medical data that appears to be from electronic health records or clin...\n  - [3] (Score: 69) MUST rewrite responses that contain medical advice language by converting recommendations into educa...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
