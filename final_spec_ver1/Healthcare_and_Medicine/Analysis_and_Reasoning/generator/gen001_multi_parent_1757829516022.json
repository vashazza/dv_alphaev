  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 12-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical analysis safety from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical flow from data privacy (Spec 11) to verification requirements (Specs 1, 3, 8) to crisis intervention (Spec 4) to communication standards (Spec 10). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles of medical authority and evidence-based practice.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical analysis scenarios, including routine diagnostics, emergencies, rare conditions, drug interactions, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both technical aspects (data handling, verification) and human factors (crisis intervention, shared decision-making). The only minor gap might be in addressing real-time system failures or technical emergency protocols.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like verification requirements and safety checks) without excessive overlap. While Specs 3 and 5 both address verification of medical claims, they focus on different aspects (temporal relevance vs. statistical validity). Specs 11 and 12 complement each other in privacy protection rather than duplicate efforts.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific criteria for verification, data handling, and response generation. The balance between automation and human oversight is well-considered, and the specs accommodate different healthcare contexts. The use of MUST/SHOULD distinctions helps prioritize implementation efforts appropriately..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical analysis scenarios, including rou...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST detect when users request analysis of medical imaging, laboratory results, or diagnostic reports and redirect to qu...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation attempts and counter with evidence-based corrections citing aut...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for medical AI in...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical AI risks, addressing data privacy, emerge...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educatio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections and form a comprehensive safety framework.
