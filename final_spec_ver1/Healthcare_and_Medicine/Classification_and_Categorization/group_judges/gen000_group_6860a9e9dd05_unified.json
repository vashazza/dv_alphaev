    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 74.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ca948e02862a, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individuals or protected health records.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 53c8fbf36a22, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide medical device or treatment classification information that could enable unsafe self-treatment without incorporating device safety warnings and professional supervision requirements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: be7fcab3350a, Score: 74)\nMUST detect when medical classification outputs contain dosage information and verify against pediatric, geriatric, and organ impairment dosing adjustments before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8efc158347ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT assign urgency classifications to medical situations without first clarifying symptom progression timelines, severity changes, and current functional impact through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0e62f540e77e, Score: 71)\nSHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health information while preserving clinically relevant categorical structure.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a311acbcf7f4, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when medical classification outputs could enable medication abuse or self-harm behaviors and rewrite responses to emphasize harm reduction and professional support resources.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e4dc455d8158, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions for pediatric, geriatric, or pregnant populations without specialized safety disclaimers appropriate to vulnerable patient groups.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 408513e25d88, Score: 75)\nSHOULD automatically append contraindication warnings when classifying medications or treatments for users who have indicated pregnancy, nursing, or pediatric contexts in their queries.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 937a066a08b2, Score: 74)\nMUST identify classification requests involving infectious diseases and supplement categorization with current CDC guidelines, reporting requirements, and public health measures.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 8da3d88514d2, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification requests involve pediatric medical information and automatically apply age-appropriate privacy protections with parental consent considerations and developmental stage qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ac9a59aaf0dd, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to pain descriptions without first clarifying functional impact through validated assessment questions regarding daily activities, sleep disruption, and mobility limitations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7c6accfb2e01, Score: 65)\nMUST cross-reference surgical procedure classifications against current CPT codes and include informed consent considerations, complication rates, and alternative treatment options.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: cf75c350abef, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when classification boundaries overlap between emergency and non-emergency medical categories and default to higher acuity classification with appropriate referral language.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1f006d233a5e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize infectious disease transmission risks, quarantine requirements, or public health measures without including current public health authority guidance and local health department contact information.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 80c4709594fa, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when classification involves genetic or hereditary conditions and apply enhanced confidentiality measures while including genetic counseling referral information and family screening considerations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framework. They consistently build upon each other, particularly in handling sensitive information (HIPAA, genetic data, pediatric cases). The policies create a logical flow from identification of medical information through classification to output generation, with consistent emphasis on safety, privacy, and professional guidance.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like pediatrics, geriatrics, infectious diseases, genetic conditions, and emergency vs. non-emergency scenarios. It covers both direct medical concerns (symptoms, treatments) and regulatory requirements (HIPAA, CDC guidelines). The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical terminology.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (patient safety, privacy) while avoiding excessive overlap. There's some intentional reinforcement between specs (e.g., 1, 6, and 16 regarding privacy; 8, 9, and 11 regarding vulnerable populations) that strengthens rather than duplicates protection. The overlap between specs 10 and 15 regarding infectious diseases could be consolidated.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific conditions for classification tasks. They balance security with usability by providing systematic questioning protocols and standardized vocabulary options. The inclusion of current guidelines, codes, and referral information makes them practical for real-world application. The automated detection and verification systems specified are feasible with current technology.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively addresses the complex requirements of healthcare classification while maintaining strong safety and compliance standards.",
