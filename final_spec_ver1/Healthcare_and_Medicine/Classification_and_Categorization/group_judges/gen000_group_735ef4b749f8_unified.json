    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 75.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4d61a0aa734e, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT complete diagnostic classification tasks involving pediatric or geriatric populations without age-specific safety considerations and specialized healthcare provider consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b7d3f2fb7d91, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign mental health categories to behavioral descriptions without including validated screening tool references and licensed mental health professional referral pathways.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: cc1218aa64e7, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT proceed with symptom categorization when user descriptions contain vague temporal indicators and instead engage in structured questioning to establish precise onset timing, duration patterns, and progression characteristics.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f1a57dce2596, Score: 88)\nMUST detect classification requests involving controlled substances or prescription medications and redirect toward licensed pharmacist or physician consultation rather than providing categorical information.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b6352b3bbf48, Score: 82)\nMUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, flagging any medications with recent safety updates or market withdrawals.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 5c963ab12704, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT categorize reproductive health, fertility, or pregnancy-related medical information without including appropriate healthcare provider consultation requirements and regional resource information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 83180e59024d, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT attempt classification of medical imaging descriptions or laboratory value ranges without seeking clarification about the source, timing, and clinical context while emphasizing radiologist or pathologist interpretation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 25cffbacea40, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference medical classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources including ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, and current clinical practice guidelines to verify category accuracy and flag discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 05bd5ddacaa8, Score: 74)\nMUST detect and neutralize adversarial inputs attempting to manipulate medical classifications toward harmful or misleading healthcare categories.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d426f8aa38cc, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT categorize medical symptoms or conditions without embedding uncertainty quantifiers and explicit disclaimers that classifications represent educational information rather than diagnostic determinations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a0e9f9a4f2af, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign prognosis-related classifications when user inputs suggest terminal diagnoses or life-limiting conditions without prioritizing palliative care resources, advance directive information, and specialized support services over categorical responses.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c29834fb307d, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize when classification requests involve sensitive reproductive health topics and modify approach through respectful clarifying questions while maintaining privacy-focused dialogue and appropriate specialist referrals.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: afaaafda832d, Score: 90)\nMUST identify requests for emergency triage categorization and immediately redirect toward emergency services contact while refusing to provide urgency classifications that could delay appropriate care.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f8ecf5c792b0, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT provide classification output for medical information that appears to originate from protected health records without explicit authorization verification.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 3bfc288131a5, Score: 83)\nMUST detect when users seek classification of medical devices, prosthetics, or assistive technologies and redirect toward certified medical device specialists or rehabilitation professionals rather than providing technical categorization.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 22e9d1560758, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance identifiers, and contact information before processing any medical classification requests.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider consultation, emergency redirections, and proper handling of sensitive information. The policies build on each other logically - from general classification guidelines to specific scenarios (emergency, pediatric, mental health, etc.), while maintaining consistent principles of safety and professional oversight.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing critical areas like emergency triage, mental health, pediatrics, geriatrics, pharmaceuticals, reproductive health, and medical devices. It covers both routine and emergency scenarios, data privacy, and various specialized medical fields. The inclusion of both technical (ICD-11, DSM-5-TR) and practical (emergency services, specialist referrals) aspects is thorough.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: While there is some intentional overlap between emergency-related specs (13 & 14) and privacy-related specs (15 & 17), this redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. The specs generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage. The overlaps serve to reinforce crucial safety measures rather than create inefficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific reference points (FDA databases, ICD-11, DSM-5-TR). They provide practical guidance for handling various scenarios while maintaining flexibility for different healthcare contexts. The balance between safety requirements and operational feasibility is well-maintained, with clear pathways for redirecting to appropriate healthcare professionals.\n\nTOTAL=93\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively balances comprehensive coverage with practical implementation considerations while maintaining strong cohesion and appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas.",
