  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framework. They consistently address related concerns (e.g., specs 2, 5, 6 regarding vulnerable populations; specs 3, 8, 13 regarding privacy/HIPAA) and build upon each other logically. The policies maintain consistent emphasis on safety, privacy, and clinical accuracy while smoothly transitioning between different medical contexts.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like pediatrics, geriatrics, infectious diseases, psychiatric conditions, genetic conditions, and surgical procedures. It covers both clinical and administrative aspects (CPT codes, HIPAA), emergency vs. non-emergency scenarios, and special populations. The inclusion of public health measures and current clinical standards ensures comprehensive regulatory compliance.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap in privacy protection measures (specs 3, 8, 13) and terminology standardization (specs 1, 15), this redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical healthcare requirements. However, some consolidation could be possible between specs 2 and 16 regarding dosage verification, and specs 7 and 11 regarding infectious diseases, hence not achieving maximum score.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with concrete requirements for implementation. They balance security with usability by including specific guidance (e.g., CDC guidelines, CPT codes) and practical considerations (e.g., referral language, alternative treatments). The main challenge might be maintaining currency with rapidly evolving medical standards and guidelines, slightly reducing practicality."
