    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framework. They consistently build upon each other, particularly in handling sensitive information (HIPAA, genetic data, pediatric cases). The policies create a logical flow from identification of medical information through classification to output generation, with consistent emphasis on safety, privacy, and professional guidance.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like pediatrics, geriatrics, infectious diseases, genetic conditions, and emergency vs. non-emergency scenarios. It covers both direct medical concerns (symptoms, treatments) and regulatory requirements (HIPAA, CDC guidelines). The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical terminology.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (patient safety, privacy) while avoiding excessive overlap. There's some intentional reinforcement between specs (e.g., 1, 6, and 16 regarding privacy; 8, 9, and 11 regarding vulnerable populations) that strengthens rather than duplicates protection. The overlap between specs 10 and 15 regarding infectious diseases could be consolidated.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable steps and specific conditions for classification tasks. They balance security with usability by providing systematic questioning protocols and standardized vocabulary options. The inclusion of current guidelines, codes, and referral information makes them practical for real-world application. The automated detection and verification systems specified are feasible with current technology."
