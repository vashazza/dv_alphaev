    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical classification safety. They logically build upon each other, from basic PII protection (Spec 1) to specific handling of various medical domains (psychiatric, surgical, drug interactions). The specs consistently emphasize patient safety, professional verification, and appropriate disclaimers. Clear thematic connections exist between mental health specs (2, 11, 12), treatment classifications (8, 10), and emergency response requirements (11, 14).",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides exceptional coverage across medical classification scenarios, addressing data privacy, mental health, surgical procedures, drug interactions, imaging findings, and emergency situations. It covers both technical aspects (terminology validation, coding standards) and human factors (crisis intervention, stigmatization). The only minor gap might be in handling pediatric-specific classifications.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (especially mental health and crisis intervention) without excessive overlap. While specs 11 and 14 both address emergency situations, they do so from complementary angles. The group efficiently consolidates related concepts while maintaining necessary emphasis on crucial safety aspects. Some minor consolidation could be possible between specs 2 and 12 regarding psychiatric classifications.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable items and specific conditions for each scenario. They balance security with usability by providing specific guidance on when to redirect to human professionals versus continuing with classification tasks. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like terminology updates and standardization."
