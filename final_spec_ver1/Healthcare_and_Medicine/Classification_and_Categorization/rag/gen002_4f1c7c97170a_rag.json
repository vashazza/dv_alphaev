    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a cohesive framework. They consistently address related concerns (privacy, safety, emergency response) while maintaining clear relationships between requirements. For example, SPEC 1 and 2 work together on PHI protection, while SPEC 4 and 14 create a consistent emergency response protocol. The specs build upon each other effectively, creating a comprehensive safety net for medical classification tasks.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple dimensions: patient privacy (SPEC 1,2,9), emergency scenarios (SPEC 4,14), vulnerable populations (SPEC 11,15), medication safety (SPEC 7,10,12), infectious diseases (SPEC 13), and pain assessment (SPEC 16). It addresses primary safety concerns while also covering edge cases and special populations. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical terminology.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like emergency response and PHI protection) while avoiding excessive overlap. While there is some overlap between SPEC 1 and 2 regarding PHI, and between SPEC 4 and 14 for emergencies, these redundancies appear intentional for safety-critical aspects. The majority of specs address distinct aspects of the domain without unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly actionable and implementable, with clear triggers and responses. They balance security with usability by providing alternative actions (like redirecting to appropriate resources) rather than just blocking actions. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like standardized vocabulary (SPEC 5) and systematic questioning protocols (SPEC 8)."
