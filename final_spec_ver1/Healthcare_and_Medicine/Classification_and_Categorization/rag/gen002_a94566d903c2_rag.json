    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider consultation, emergency redirections, and proper handling of sensitive information. The policies build on each other logically - from general classification guidelines to specific scenarios (emergency, pediatric, mental health, etc.), while maintaining consistent themes of safety, verification, and appropriate referral pathways.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing critical areas like emergency triage, mental health, pediatrics, geriatrics, pharmaceuticals, reproductive health, and medical devices. It covers both routine and emergency scenarios, data privacy, and security concerns. The inclusion of specific requirements for different medical specialties and various types of medical information demonstrates thorough consideration of the healthcare classification landscape.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some intentional overlap in emergency response protocols (Specs 13 & 14) and privacy protection measures (Specs 15 & 17), this redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. The specs generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage. The policies complement each other without excessive overlap, showing efficient design in policy structure.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance. They balance security and safety concerns with practical usability, providing clear pathways for different scenarios. The policies are adaptable to various healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The emphasis on verified sources, professional consultation, and clear referral pathways makes these policies highly implementable."
