    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive framework for medical classification. They build upon each other effectively - from terminology validation (Spec 2) to handling complex cases (Spec 3) to ensuring appropriate disclaimers (Spec 4). The policies create a cohesive safety net that addresses both technical and ethical aspects of medical classification.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple critical areas: surgical procedures, drug interactions, psychiatric/neurological conditions, emergency situations, and data privacy. It addresses primary clinical concerns (Specs 1-4), secondary considerations (Specs 5-8), and edge cases (Specs 9, 15). The inclusion of both clinical and administrative requirements demonstrates thorough domain coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While most specs are distinct and complementary, there is some notable redundancy between Specs 16 and 17 regarding PII handling. However, this redundancy appears intentional for critical safety areas. The drug interaction policies (Specs 5-6) show appropriate overlapping coverage without excessive duplication. Some consolidation opportunity exists but doesn't significantly impact effectiveness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security with usability by providing concrete steps (e.g., \"rewrite responses,\" \"append emergency contact information\"). The policies are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like standardized vocabulary options and CPT code cross-referencing."
