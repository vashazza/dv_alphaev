    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical classification safety. They logically build upon each other, from terminology validation (Spec 2) to handling complex cases (Spec 3), with consistent emphasis on verification, standardization, and patient safety. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent themes of verification, standardization, and cautious classification.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical classification scenarios, addressing clinical terminology, drug interactions, surgical procedures, imaging findings, psychiatric conditions, and emergencies. It covers both routine and edge cases, including PII protection (Spec 16), crisis intervention (Spec 11), and complex multi-condition scenarios (Spec 3). The only minor gap might be in handling international medical standards variations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like safety checks and verification requirements) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. There's some intentional overlap between Specs 1 and 13 regarding surgical procedures, and between Specs 5 and 6 for drug interactions, but these serve to reinforce critical safety measures rather than create inefficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security with usability by providing clear alternatives (like standardized vocabulary options in Spec 14) and practical workflows. The policies are adaptable to different healthcare contexts, though some (like Spec 3's multidisciplinary consultation requirement) might need scaling adjustments for smaller facilities."
