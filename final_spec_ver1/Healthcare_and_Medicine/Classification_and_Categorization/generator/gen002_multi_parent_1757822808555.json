  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a cohesive framework. They consistently address related concerns (privacy, safety, emergency response) while maintaining clear relationships between requirements. For example, SPEC 1 and 2 work together on PHI protection, while SPEC 4 and 14 create a consistent emergency response protocol. The specs build upon each other effectively, creating a comprehensive safety net for medical classification tasks.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across multiple dimensions: patient privacy (SPEC 1,2,9), emergency scenarios (SPEC 4,14), vulnerable populations (SPEC 11,15), medication safety (SPEC 7,10,12), infectious diseases (SPEC 13), and pain assessment (SPEC 16). It addresses primary safety concerns while also covering edge cases and special populations. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-language medical terminology.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like emergency response and PHI protection) while avoiding excessive overlap. While there is some overlap between SPEC 1 and 2 regarding PHI, and between SPEC 4 and 14 for emergencies, these redundancies appear intentional for safety-critical aspects. The majority of specs address distinct aspects of the domain without unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are highly actionable and implementable, with clear triggers and responses. They balance security with usability by providing alternative actions (like redirecting to appropriate resources) rather than just blocking actions. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like standardized vocabulary (SPEC 5) and systematic questioning protocols (SPEC 8)..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses multiple ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across the medical classification domain, addressing key...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST NOT provide classification output for medical information that appears to originate from protected health records w...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individua...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framewor...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like ped...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individua...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide medical device or treatment classification information that could enable unsafe self-treatment without ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framewor...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing critical areas lik...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT complete diagnostic classification tasks involving pediatric or geriatric populations without age-specific safe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT assign mental health categories to behavioral descriptions without including validated screening tool reference...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical classificati...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across medical classification scenarios, addressing d...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record number...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST NOT assign psychiatric or neurological classifications without first clarifying whether the user seeks educational ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a cohesive framework.
