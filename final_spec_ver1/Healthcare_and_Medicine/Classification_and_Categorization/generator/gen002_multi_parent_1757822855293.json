  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider consultation, emergency redirections, and proper handling of sensitive information. The policies build on each other logically - from general classification guidelines to specific scenarios (emergency, pediatric, mental health, etc.), while maintaining consistent themes of safety, verification, and appropriate referral pathways.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing critical areas like emergency triage, mental health, pediatrics, geriatrics, pharmaceuticals, reproductive health, and medical devices. It covers both routine and emergency scenarios, data privacy, and security concerns. The inclusion of specific requirements for different medical specialties and various types of medical information demonstrates thorough consideration of the healthcare classification landscape.. Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in emergency response protocols (Specs 13 & 14) and privacy protection measures (Specs 15 & 17), this redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. The specs generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robust coverage. The policies complement each other without excessive overlap, showing efficient design in policy structure.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance. They balance security and safety concerns with practical usability, providing clear pathways for different scenarios. The policies are adaptable to various healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The emphasis on verified sources, professional consultation, and clear referral pathways makes these policies highly implementable..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses multiple ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across the medical classification domain, addressing key...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST NOT provide classification output for medical information that appears to originate from protected health records w...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individua...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framewor...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like ped...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individua...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide medical device or treatment classification information that could enable unsafe self-treatment without ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare classification framewor...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing critical areas lik...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT complete diagnostic classification tasks involving pediatric or geriatric populations without age-specific safe...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT assign mental health categories to behavioral descriptions without including validated screening tool reference...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical classificati...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across medical classification scenarios, addressing d...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record number...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST NOT assign psychiatric or neurological classifications without first clarifying whether the user seeks educational ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a cohesive framework.
