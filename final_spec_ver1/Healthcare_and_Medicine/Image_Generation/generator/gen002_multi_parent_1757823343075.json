  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses healthcare image generation from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical flow from data protection (Specs 1,2,6) to accuracy verification (Specs 4,7) to safety measures (Specs 11,13,14). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent focus on patient privacy, medical accuracy, and appropriate use cases.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare-specific concerns, including PII protection, medical accuracy, emergency scenarios, mental health considerations, and professional boundaries. It addresses both technical aspects (prompt injection, data masking) and domain-specific requirements (anatomical accuracy, drug interactions). The only minor gap might be in specific guidelines for handling multi-language medical content.. Redundancy: The specs show strategic redundancy in critical areas (patient privacy appears in multiple specs but with different focuses) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. Specs 6 and 1 could potentially be merged, but their separate existence isn't problematic. The overlapping coverage in sensitive areas (medical accuracy, privacy, emergency handling) provides important safety nets without excessive repetition.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable items and specific verification steps. The inclusion of interactive dialogues, verification processes, and explicit redirects makes the policies readily translatable to technical requirements. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, though some specs (like anatomical cross-referencing) might require substantial computational resources..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical i...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors.
