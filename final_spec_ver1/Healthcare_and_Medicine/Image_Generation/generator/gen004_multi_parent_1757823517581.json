  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical image generation safety from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical flow from detection (Specs 1,3,7) to verification (Specs 4,5) to appropriate response actions (Specs 8,11,13). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles around safety, accuracy, and ethical considerations.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across the healthcare domain, addressing pharmaceutical safety, anatomical accuracy, PII protection, illegal practices, vulnerable populations, mental health concerns, and experimental treatments. It covers both direct risks (self-harm, illegal procedures) and indirect risks (potential misuse, stigmatization). The inclusion of audit trails (Spec 15) provides accountability. Only minor gaps exist in emergency medicine scenarios.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., Specs 3 and 13 both address self-harm, Specs 11 and 14 both cover unproven treatments), this redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for critical safety areas. The overlap provides multiple layers of protection for high-risk scenarios while maintaining distinct aspects in each specification. Some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising safety.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with specific triggers and responses. The inclusion of educational alternatives and redirects (rather than just blocks) shows good balance between security and usefulness. The audit requirement (Spec 15) and cross-validation requirements (Spec 4) may be resource-intensive but are necessary for the domain. The specifications appear adaptable to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for safe medical image g...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across medical image generation risks, addressing...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST detect requests for drug identification imagery and redirect to pharmaceutical verification resources rather than v...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate images of prescription drug labels, dosage instructions, or medication administration guides that coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework.
