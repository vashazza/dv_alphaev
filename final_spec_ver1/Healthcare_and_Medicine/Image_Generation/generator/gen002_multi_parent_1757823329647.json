  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for safe medical image generation. They consistently build upon each other, from basic PII protection (Specs 6, 17) to handling specific medical scenarios (Specs 1, 2, 14). The policies share common themes of safety, verification, and redirection to appropriate resources, creating a unified approach to medical image generation governance.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates exceptional coverage across medical image generation risks, addressing drug-related content (Specs 1, 2, 14), anatomical accuracy (Spec 5), vulnerable populations (Spec 11), emergency scenarios (Spec 16), and various medical procedures (Specs 7, 13). It covers both direct risks (self-harm, illegal procedures) and indirect risks (misleading information, privacy concerns).. Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in PII protection (Specs 6 and 17) and medical misinformation prevention (Specs 10 and 13), most redundancy appears strategic for critical safety areas. However, there could be some consolidation of similar concepts, particularly in the handling of experimental/unproven treatments and PII protection requirements.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with concrete implementation guidance. They balance security with educational value by consistently offering alternatives rather than just blocking content. The verification and cross-referencing requirements (Specs 4, 5) might be resource-intensive but are necessary for maintaining medical accuracy and safety..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 90/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical i...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors.
