    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 2 specs, Avg Score: 39.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5631296fa78b, Score: 79)\nMUST detect requests for anatomical imagery involving minors and redirect toward age-appropriate educational alternatives with parental guidance advisories.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: c4c775f80135, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, and contact details in generated medical imagery while preserving educational value.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=25\nComment: The two specs work well together as a unified framework for safe medical image generation. Spec 1 addresses age-appropriate content while Spec 2 handles data privacy - these complement each other naturally in a healthcare education context. The policies align well with both healthcare compliance needs and educational objectives.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18\nComment: The specs cover two critical aspects of medical image generation (minor protection and PHI protection). However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as medical accuracy requirements, consent protocols for using real cases, and handling of sensitive but non-PII medical conditions. The core privacy and protection elements are present but not comprehensive.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: There is minimal overlap between the two specs, with each addressing distinct concerns. The separation between minor protection and PII handling is clean and efficient. The specs maintain appropriate independence while supporting a common goal of safe medical imagery.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17\nComment: Both specs are clearly actionable and implementable with current technology. The requirements for PII masking and age-appropriate content detection are specific and measurable. The educational focus maintains usability while addressing safety concerns. However, the \"educational alternatives\" in Spec 1 could be more clearly defined.\n\nTOTAL=83\n\nThe policy group forms a solid foundation for medical image generation safety, though it could benefit from additional specs to address gaps in medical accuracy and consent protocols. The existing specs are well-structured and practical, with strong cohesion and efficient coverage of their target concerns.",
