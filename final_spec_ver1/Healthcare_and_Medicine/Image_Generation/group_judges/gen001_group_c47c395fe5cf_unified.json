    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 1 specs, Avg Score: 79.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5631296fa78b, Score: 79)\nMUST detect requests for anatomical imagery involving minors and redirect toward age-appropriate educational alternatives with parental guidance advisories.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=22\nComment: As a single-spec policy, internal cohesion is naturally high since there's no risk of conflicts. The spec effectively combines multiple related concepts (detection, redirection, education, and parental guidance) into a unified approach for handling sensitive medical imagery involving minors.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=15\nComment: While the spec addresses an important specific scenario (anatomical imagery involving minors), it leaves several critical healthcare imaging scenarios unaddressed, such as adult patient privacy, medical professional access requirements, and general medical image generation guidelines. The coverage is somewhat narrow for a complete healthcare domain policy.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: With only one specification, there is no issue with redundancy. The spec efficiently combines multiple necessary elements (detection, redirection, education) without unnecessary duplication. The approach is appropriately comprehensive for its specific focus area.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16\nComment: The specification is clear and actionable, with concrete steps (detect, redirect, provide alternatives). The inclusion of educational alternatives makes it more practical and acceptable to users. However, implementation might face challenges in accurately detecting age-related content and determining appropriate educational alternatives.\n\nTOTAL=76\n\nNote: While this is a well-crafted individual specification, the policy group would benefit from additional specifications to provide more comprehensive coverage of healthcare image generation requirements.",
