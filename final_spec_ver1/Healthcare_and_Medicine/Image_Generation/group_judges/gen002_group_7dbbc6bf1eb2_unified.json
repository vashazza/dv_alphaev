    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 70.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 30aea3be9882, Score: 80)\nMUST detect requests for drug identification imagery and redirect to pharmaceutical verification resources rather than visual generation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3cb22012d9e2, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate images of prescription drug labels, dosage instructions, or medication administration guides that could be mistaken for personalized medical directions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 16cc550a1912, Score: 83)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of images showing self-harm methods, unsafe medical practices, or dangerous home remedies while offering safer educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 90ebad480188, Score: 69)\nSHOULD cross-validate medical terminology and visual representations against multiple peer-reviewed sources before generating healthcare-related imagery.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4be89960d037, Score: 79)\nMUST verify that anatomical imagery maintains scientific accuracy by cross-referencing multiple authoritative medical sources before visual generation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 16b40f198fcd, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, healthcare provider credentials, and personal health information from image generation prompts before content creation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9a09f13cc2c3, Score: 79)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare activities that violate professional standards in major jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0907b804352e, Score: 75)\nSHOULD rewrite prompts requesting imagery of controlled substances, medical waste handling, or biohazardous materials into appropriate safety education visuals with regulatory compliance information.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 49c0c59e7e73, Score: 66)\nMUST recognize when medical device imagery could enable misuse or counterfeiting and generate simplified educational representations that preserve learning value without technical specifications.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3574ed1b610b, Score: 72)\nMUST detect prompts seeking to visualize rare disease presentations, genetic conditions, or syndromic features and provide educational alternatives that avoid potential patient identification or stigmatization.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 144baa040e13, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite prompts containing unverified medical treatment claims or experimental procedures into evidence-based educational alternatives focusing on established medical knowledge.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 3ece41570cb2, Score: 73)\nMUST engage in confirmatory dialogue when medical image requests involve pediatric, geriatric, or vulnerable population contexts, ensuring appropriate sensitivity and professional oversight considerations are addressed.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 06cf95928007, Score: 86)\nMUST recognize prompts requesting visualization of self-harm methods, dangerous medical procedures, or life-threatening scenarios and redirect toward appropriate mental health or emergency resources.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: bf2123ad51ef, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize prompts seeking to visualize unproven medical treatments, experimental procedures, or alternative therapies without scientific backing and redirect toward established medical knowledge.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8b6e4e3a7831, Score: 62)\nMUST maintain audit trails for medical image generation to enable clinical oversight and compliance verification.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 206ec6fa9812, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, dates of birth, and contact details in any generated medical imagery or documentation.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework. They flow naturally from data protection (PII masking) to content safety (preventing harmful imagery) to educational alternatives. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent focus on healthcare safety and compliance.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy set addresses an impressive range of scenarios including drug identification, medical procedures, vulnerable populations, device imagery, and data protection. It covers primary risks (PII, harmful content), secondary concerns (educational alternatives), and edge cases (rare diseases, experimental procedures). The only minor gap might be in emergency response scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20\nComment: There is some intentional overlap in PII protection (Specs 6 and 16) and harmful content detection (Specs 3 and 13), but this redundancy appears strategic for critical safety areas. However, some consolidation could be done between specs handling experimental/unproven treatments (11 and 14) and medical verification (4 and 5).\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. The balance between security and educational value is well-maintained through the consistent pattern of redirecting harmful requests to appropriate alternatives. The audit trail requirement supports real-world compliance needs. Some specs might require significant computational resources for cross-validation.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThis is a particularly well-designed policy group that shows careful consideration of healthcare-specific risks while maintaining practical implementability. The high cohesion score reflects how effectively the policies work together to create a comprehensive safety framework while avoiding major conflicts or gaps.",
