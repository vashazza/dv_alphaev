    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 1 specs, Avg Score: 0.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 59209b5d2c73, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, and institutional identifiers when generating medical imagery or educational content.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=15\nComment: While this is a single spec, it demonstrates internal cohesion by addressing related aspects of PII protection in medical imagery. However, as a standalone policy, it lacks interaction with other specifications that would create a more comprehensive framework for medical image generation safety.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=12\nComment: The spec covers key PII elements (names, record numbers, institutional IDs) but leaves gaps in other important areas of medical image generation safety such as anatomical accuracy, diagnostic validity, and ethical considerations for sensitive medical conditions. The PII coverage itself is solid but narrow in scope.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: As a single spec, it efficiently combines related PII protection requirements without unnecessary duplication. The specification appropriately groups related identifiers together while maintaining distinct categories (personal, medical, institutional).\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16\nComment: The requirement is clear, actionable, and technically implementable using existing PII detection and masking technologies. It addresses a real-world need in medical education and documentation while maintaining privacy compliance. The automatic detection requirement makes it practical for large-scale implementation.\n\nTOTAL=65\n\nThe policy, while well-formed for its specific focus, would benefit from being part of a larger group of specifications addressing other aspects of medical image generation safety and compliance. Its strength lies in its practical implementability and efficient handling of PII protection, but its isolation limits its overall effectiveness as a complete policy framework.",
