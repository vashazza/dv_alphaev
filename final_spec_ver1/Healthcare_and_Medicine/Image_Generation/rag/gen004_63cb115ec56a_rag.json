    "cohesion": "While this is a single specification, it demonstrates strong internal cohesion by combining detection, redirection, and advisory elements in a logical flow. However, as a standalone policy, it would benefit from companion specs addressing related healthcare imagery scenarios.",
    "coverage": "The spec addresses an important specific use case (anatomical imagery involving minors) but leaves gaps in coverage for other critical healthcare imaging scenarios, adult anatomical imagery, and specific guidelines for what constitutes \"age-appropriate\" alternatives. The protection mechanism is present but narrow in scope.",
    "redundancy": "As a single specification, it avoids redundancy while maintaining necessary components (detection, redirection, advisory). The multi-layered approach (detection + redirection + advisory) provides appropriate redundancy for this sensitive use case without duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specification is clear and actionable, with concrete steps (detect, redirect, advise). The inclusion of parental guidance advisories makes it practical for real-world implementation. However, it may need more specific guidelines on implementation details and what constitutes \"age-appropriate\" content."
