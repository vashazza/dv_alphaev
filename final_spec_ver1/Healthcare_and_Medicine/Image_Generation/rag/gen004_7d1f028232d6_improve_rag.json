    "cohesion": "As a single-spec policy, internal cohesion is naturally high since there's no risk of conflicts. The spec effectively combines multiple related concepts (detection, redirection, education, and parental guidance) in a logical flow. However, being a single spec limits the potential for beneficial interactions between multiple requirements.",
    "coverage": "While the spec addresses an important safety concern regarding minors in medical imagery, it leaves several critical areas uncovered, such as adult patient privacy, medical accuracy requirements, consent protocols, and clinical use cases. The educational alternative aspect is well-considered, but the overall coverage is limited by having only one specification.",
    "redundancy": "With only one specification, there is no unnecessary duplication. The spec efficiently combines multiple necessary elements (detection, redirection, education) without redundant requirements. However, in this sensitive domain, some strategic redundancy might actually be beneficial for safety assurance.",
    "practicality": "The specification is clear and actionable, with concrete steps (detect, redirect, provide alternatives). The inclusion of parental guidance advisories shows practical consideration of real-world implementation. However, the detection mechanism's specifics and the nature of \"age-appropriate alternatives\" could benefit from more detail."
