    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses medical image generation safety from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical flow from detection (Specs 1,3,7) to verification (Specs 4,5) to appropriate response actions (Specs 8,11,13). The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles around safety, accuracy, and ethical considerations.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors. It addresses drug-related concerns (Specs 1,2), anatomical accuracy (Spec 5), PII protection (Spec 6), vulnerable populations (Spec 12), and various edge cases like rare diseases (Spec 10) and experimental procedures (Spec 14). The inclusion of audit trails (Spec 15) provides meta-coverage for oversight purposes.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between certain specs (e.g., Specs 3 and 13 regarding self-harm, Specs 11 and 14 about unproven treatments), this redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for critical safety areas. However, some consolidation could be possible between similar specs to improve efficiency without compromising safety. The redundancy level is appropriate but could be slightly optimized.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with specific requirements and concrete response actions. The inclusion of audit trails and verification processes makes implementation feasible. Most specs balance security with usability by offering educational alternatives rather than just blocking content. The main practical challenge might be maintaining up-to-date medical knowledge bases for verification purposes."
