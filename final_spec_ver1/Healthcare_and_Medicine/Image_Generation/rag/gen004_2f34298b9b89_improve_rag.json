    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses healthcare image generation from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical flow from data protection (Specs 1,2,6) to accuracy verification (Specs 4,7) to safety measures (Specs 11,13,14). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent focus on patient privacy, medical accuracy, and appropriate use cases.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare-specific concerns, including PII protection, medical accuracy, emergency scenarios, mental health considerations, and professional boundaries. It addresses both technical aspects (prompt injection, data masking) and domain-specific requirements (anatomical accuracy, medical documentation). The only minor gap might be in specific guidelines for handling multi-language medical content.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show strategic redundancy in critical areas (patient privacy appears in multiple specs but with different focuses) while avoiding unnecessary duplication. Specs 6 and 1 could potentially be merged, but their separate existence isn't problematic. The redundancy in verification requirements across different medical contexts (Specs 2,13,14) is appropriate given the high-stakes nature of healthcare content.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained through interactive dialogues and structured verification processes. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and include practical alternatives (like redirecting to legitimate channels) rather than just restrictions. The verification requirements might slightly impact system performance but are necessary for the domain."
