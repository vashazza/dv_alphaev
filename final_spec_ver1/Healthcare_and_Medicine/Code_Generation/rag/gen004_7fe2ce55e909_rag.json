    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework. They consistently emphasize patient safety, data privacy, and professional oversight across different healthcare contexts. The policies build upon each other well - from basic data handling (Spec 6) to specific use cases like clinical trials (Spec 4, 12) and medical devices (Spec 10, 11, 17).",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage of healthcare code generation risks, addressing crucial areas like EHR access, medical calculations, device integration, clinical trials, and telemedicine. It covers both direct patient care aspects and supporting infrastructure. The inclusion of interoperability standards (Spec 9, 14) and medical coding systems (Spec 16) demonstrates attention to technical integration requirements.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 9 and 14 regarding healthcare interoperability, and between Specs 10 and 17 regarding medical device interfaces, these redundancies appear intentional and provide valuable reinforcement for critical safety areas. The majority of specs address distinct concerns while maintaining consistent safety principles.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and include specific implementation guidance. They balance security needs with practical usage by offering educational alternatives and mock data options. The policies are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and provide clear escalation paths. The emphasis on demonstration examples and professional validation makes implementation feasible."
