    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework. They consistently emphasize human oversight, data protection, and educational/demonstration approaches. The policies build upon each other well, with clear relationships between authentication (Spec 5), PII handling (Spec 6), and various domain-specific requirements. The progression from general healthcare data handling to specific use cases (clinical trials, medical devices, telemedicine) is logical and well-structured.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare software domains, addressing EHR access, genetic data, clinical trials, medical devices, telemedicine, and healthcare standards (FHIR, ICD-10, etc.). It covers both direct patient care scenarios and supporting infrastructure. The inclusion of edge cases like emergency response systems and critical alerts demonstrates thorough risk consideration. Only minor gaps exist in areas like multi-jurisdictional compliance.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 9 and 14 regarding healthcare interoperability, this redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for critical safety areas. The policies generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining appropriate emphasis on crucial aspects through different contexts. The reinforcement of security and validation requirements across multiple specs serves a clear purpose.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly actionable and clear, with specific implementation guidance (like using mock data, embedding validation layers, and including specific security protocols). The policies balance security with usability by offering educational alternatives and demonstrations where direct implementation would be risky. The framework adapts well to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards."
