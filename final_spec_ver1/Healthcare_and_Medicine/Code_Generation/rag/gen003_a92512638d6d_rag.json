    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework. They consistently emphasize human oversight, data protection, and educational/demonstration approaches. The policies build upon each other well, with clear relationships between authentication (Spec 5), PII handling (Spec 6), and various domain-specific requirements. The progression from general healthcare data handling to specific use cases (clinical trials, medical devices, telemedicine) is logical and well-structured.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare software domains, addressing EHR access, genetic data, clinical trials, medical devices, telemedicine, and healthcare standards (FHIR, ICD-10, etc.). It covers both direct patient care scenarios and supporting systems. The inclusion of edge cases like emergency response systems and critical alerts demonstrates thorough risk consideration. Only minor gaps exist in areas like multi-jurisdictional compliance.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap between Specs 9 and 14 regarding healthcare interoperability, this redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for critical safety areas. The policies generally avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining appropriate emphasis on crucial aspects through different contexts. The reinforcement of security and validation requirements across multiple specs serves a clear purpose.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly actionable and clear, with specific guidance on what to do instead of just what to avoid. They balance security with usability by offering alternative approaches (e.g., educational examples, mock data) rather than just restrictions. The policies are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and include practical considerations like FHIR compliance and medical coding standards."
