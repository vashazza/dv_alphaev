  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 85.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical connections between different aspects of healthcare software development. They progress naturally from basic data handling (EHR access, PII protection) to specialized domains (medical devices, telemedicine) while maintaining consistent safety and validation themes. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection around critical healthcare functions.. Coverage: The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across healthcare software domains, including EHR systems, medical devices, telemedicine, clinical trials, and healthcare interoperability. It addresses both technical requirements (FHIR standards, security protocols) and procedural safeguards (professional validation, consultation requirements). The only minor gap might be in specific policies for pharmacy/medication management systems.. Redundancy: While there is some intentional overlap in critical areas (multiple specs addressing healthcare interoperability and FHIR compliance), there are also several exact duplicates (specs 13/4, 14/2, 15/10, 16/6) that could be consolidated. The redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, but the literal duplications reduce efficiency.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific implementation guidance (e.g., embedding verification layers, including validation checks). The policies balance security with usability by offering educational alternatives for restricted functionalities. The framework adapts well to different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework.
