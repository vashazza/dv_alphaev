  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 6-spec group. Average group score: 91.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical interconnections, forming a comprehensive security and compliance framework for healthcare code generation. They flow naturally from data protection (SPEC 3) to access control (SPEC 5) to specific application domains (SPEC 6). The policies consistently emphasize security, verification, and ethical considerations across different healthcare software aspects.. Coverage: The group addresses major risk areas in healthcare software development, including informed consent, bias in ML, PHI protection, telemedicine compliance, EHR security, and medication safety. It covers both technical (encryption, authentication) and regulatory (licensing, jurisdiction) requirements. Only minor gaps exist in areas like device integration and emergency system requirements.. Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. For example, while both SPEC 3 and SPEC 5 address security, they focus on different aspects (data protection vs. authentication). The verification requirements in SPEC 6 complement rather than duplicate the validation controls in other specs.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and provide specific implementation guidance (e.g., \"multiple verification checkpoints,\" \"multi-factor verification\"). They balance security needs with practical implementation considerations. The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts while maintaining compliance requirements..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework.
