    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 76.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ffadb4c302f7, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate code accessing electronic health records without first clarifying read-only versus write operations and converting write requests to demonstration-only examples with mock data.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7489c7c9da2b, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate code that performs direct medical calculations or clinical scoring without transforming requests into educational examples that demonstrate computational concepts while requiring explicit healthcare professional validation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 03441f6ff685, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials in all generated code examples and comments.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 01244346f39f, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability requests and ensure generated code adheres to HL7 FHIR standards and data exchange protocols.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d564157852d3, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when users request code for medical device integration and automatically clarify whether the intent is educational simulation, research prototype, or production use before generating appropriate responses.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0d92cba8ad97, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide code for life-critical medical systems including ventilators, defibrillators, or surgical robotics without immediate redirection to qualified medical device engineers.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c851beb2a829, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce code for emergency response systems or critical alert mechanisms without embedding redundant verification layers, manual override capabilities, and systematic failure mode analysis.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e9a3cfe1581d, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data format standardization, and semantic consistency checks.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 916fba39a7df, Score: 81)\nMUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmission safeguards, and emergency escalation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 59195a2c0ddf, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically cross-reference generated healthcare code against established medical coding standards (ICD-10, CPT, SNOMED) and flag potential classification inconsistencies.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e9a3cfe1581d, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data format standardization, and semantic consistency checks.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 01244346f39f, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability requests and ensure generated code adheres to HL7 FHIR standards and data exchange protocols.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7489c7c9da2b, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate code that performs direct medical calculations or clinical scoring without transforming requests into educational examples that demonstrate computational concepts while requiring explicit healthcare professional validation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d564157852d3, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when users request code for medical device integration and automatically clarify whether the intent is educational simulation, research prototype, or production use before generating appropriate responses.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 0d92cba8ad97, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide code for life-critical medical systems including ventilators, defibrillators, or surgical robotics without immediate redirection to qualified medical device engineers.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 916fba39a7df, Score: 81)\nMUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmission safeguards, and emergency escalation pathways.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=25\nComment: The specs form a well-integrated framework addressing healthcare code generation safety. There's clear logical progression from data access (EHR) to specific applications (medical devices, telemedicine). The specs consistently emphasize safety-first approaches through validation, verification, and professional oversight. The policies complement each other well, with earlier specs laying groundwork for more specific requirements.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group provides comprehensive coverage of major healthcare coding risks including EHR access, medical calculations, device integration, interoperability, and telemedicine. It addresses both technical aspects (FHIR standards, security protocols) and procedural safeguards (professional validation, redirections). Edge cases like emergency systems and critical alerts are also covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15\nComment: There are several instances of exact duplication (specs 8/11, 4/12, 13/2, 14/5, 15/6, 16/9) which significantly impacts the score. However, some redundancy is appropriately maintained for critical safety areas like medical device code restrictions and interoperability standards. The redundancy could be better managed while maintaining emphasis on crucial safety aspects.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific conditions and responses defined. They balance security with usability by offering educational alternatives and demonstrations where direct implementation would be unsafe. The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and provide clear guidance for implementation.\n\nTOTAL=81\n\nThe policy group shows strong cohesion and comprehensive coverage but needs significant improvement in managing redundancy. Despite this, its high practicality and thorough coverage of healthcare-specific risks make it a solid foundation for safe code generation in healthcare contexts.",
