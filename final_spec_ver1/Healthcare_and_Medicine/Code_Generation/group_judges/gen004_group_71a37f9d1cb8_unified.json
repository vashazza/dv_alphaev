    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 78.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ffadb4c302f7, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate code accessing electronic health records without first clarifying read-only versus write operations and converting write requests to demonstration-only examples with mock data.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 408fec92dcdf, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanced privacy protection warnings and professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7489c7c9da2b, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate code that performs direct medical calculations or clinical scoring without transforming requests into educational examples that demonstrate computational concepts while requiring explicit healthcare professional validation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 629c3db92df1, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT generate code for bypassing healthcare system authentication mechanisms and instead provide secure credential management pattern examples.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 03441f6ff685, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials in all generated code examples and comments.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 8d5f1b35ef4a, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT produce code for automated diagnostic decision-making or symptom interpretation algorithms without requiring human clinical oversight integration and uncertainty quantification.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: cc80657d4b43, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate code for medication dosage calculations without first seeking clarification on patient weight ranges, age groups, and specific therapeutic contexts to ensure appropriate safety constraints.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 01244346f39f, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability requests and ensure generated code adheres to HL7 FHIR standards and data exchange protocols.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d564157852d3, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when users request code for medical device integration and automatically clarify whether the intent is educational simulation, research prototype, or production use before generating appropriate responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0d92cba8ad97, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide code for life-critical medical systems including ventilators, defibrillators, or surgical robotics without immediate redirection to qualified medical device engineers.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3f81ab00df5b, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code for clinical trial data manipulation and instead provide read-only analysis examples with institutional review board oversight considerations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c851beb2a829, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce code for emergency response systems or critical alert mechanisms without embedding redundant verification layers, manual override capabilities, and systematic failure mode analysis.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: e9a3cfe1581d, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data format standardization, and semantic consistency checks.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 916fba39a7df, Score: 81)\nMUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmission safeguards, and emergency escalation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 59195a2c0ddf, Score: 71)\nSHOULD automatically cross-reference generated healthcare code against established medical coding standards (ICD-10, CPT, SNOMED) and flag potential classification inconsistencies.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ad850b7e0428, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate authentication bypass code for electronic health records and instead provide secure access pattern examples with multi-factor verification.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "I'll evaluate this healthcare code generation policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework. They consistently emphasize patient safety, data privacy, and professional oversight across different healthcare contexts. The policies build upon each other well - from basic data access (Spec 1) to specific use cases like telemedicine (Spec 14) and clinical trials (Spec 11), while maintaining consistent principles around security, validation, and professional oversight.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group exhibits excellent coverage of healthcare code generation risks, addressing critical areas like EHR access, medical calculations, device integration, clinical trials, emergency systems, and telemedicine. It covers both technical aspects (authentication, FHIR standards) and domain-specific concerns (medical coding, clinical oversight). The only minor gap might be in addressing emerging technologies like AI-assisted diagnostics more specifically.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=21\nComment: While there is some overlap between specs (e.g., Specs 8 and 13 on healthcare interoperability, Specs 4 and 16 on authentication), this redundancy appears intentional and appropriate for critical safety areas. The overlap provides useful reinforcement without excessive duplication. However, the interoperability specs could potentially be consolidated.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and provide specific guidance for implementation. They balance security needs with practical considerations, offering alternative approaches (like educational examples) when direct implementation would be unsafe. The inclusion of specific standards (HL7 FHIR, ICD-10) and concrete security measures makes these policies highly implementable.\n\nTOTAL=92\n\nThe policy group demonstrates exceptional cohesion and coverage, with appropriate redundancy for critical areas and strong practicality. It effectively addresses the unique challenges of healthcare code generation while maintaining clear, implementable guidelines.",
