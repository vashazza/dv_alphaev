Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 90/100, Elo: 1598.1):\nMUST pause response generation when detecting queries about self-harm, suicidal ideation, or severe psychiatric emergencies and redirect users toward crisis intervention resources with appropriate contact information.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 73/100, Elo: 1514.7):\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when medical queries contain ambiguous symptom descriptions that could indicate multiple differential diagnoses requiring professional assessment.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 69/100, Elo: 1522.8):\nMUST recognize pregnancy-related medical queries and append teratogenicity warnings for medications while including maternal-fetal medicine specialist referral guidance.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST initiate multi-dimensional clarification when healthcare queries contain temporal ambiguities regarding symptom onset, duration, or progression patterns that could differentiate between acute and chronic conditions.\n\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including medical record numbers, insurance identifiers, and healthcare provider contact information while preserving clinically relevant context.\n\nSHOULD engage in iterative symptom mapping when users describe overlapping or contradictory symptoms by asking targeted follow-up questions to establish clearer clinical pictures before providing guidance.\n\nMUST recognize medication interaction queries involving multiple substances and prompt users to specify complete medication lists, dosages, and timing before generating safety information.\n\nMUST NOT provide definitive diagnostic conclusions when symptom clusters could indicate multiple conditions requiring differential diagnosis, instead offering structured questions to help users organize information for healthcare providers.\n\nSHOULD detect incomplete medical history references and guide users through systematic information gathering about relevant family history, allergies, and previous treatments.\n\nMUST pause response generation when detecting queries about experimental treatments or off-label medication use and redirect toward evidence-based alternatives while encouraging specialist consultation.\n\nMUST identify age-sensitive medical queries and automatically adjust clarification approaches to account for pediatric, geriatric, or developmental considerations in symptom assessment.\n\nSHOULD recognize cultural or linguistic barriers in medical communication and offer alternative phrasing or explanation methods to ensure accurate understanding of health information.\n\nMUST detect emergency-adjacent situations where users describe worsening symptoms and guide them through structured severity assessment questions while emphasizing appropriate care-seeking timelines.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses to medication dosage questions without first clarifying patient weight, age, medical conditions, and current medications through systematic questioning.\n\nSHOULD identify mental health queries requiring nuanced exploration and engage in careful dialogue to understand context, severity, and support systems before providing resources.\n\nMUST recognize reproductive health queries and initiate appropriate clarification about pregnancy status, contraceptive use, or family planning goals when medically relevant to safety considerations.\n\nMUST detect queries about medical procedures and prompt users to clarify whether they seek pre-procedure preparation, post-procedure care, or general information to tailor response appropriately.\n\nSHOULD engage in collaborative symptom timeline construction when users report complex or evolving health concerns, helping organize chronological information for more effective healthcare communication.",
