  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 5-spec group. Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework that progressively scales from general medical query handling (Spec 1) to specific high-risk scenarios (Specs 3,4). The policies complement each other well, with Spec 2's contextual safety scaling providing an overarching principle that ties together the other more specific requirements. The misinformation handling (Spec 5) aligns well with the cautious approach of other specs.. Coverage: The group provides strong coverage across key medical risk areas including general diagnostic uncertainty, pregnancy-related concerns, mental health emergencies, and misinformation. It addresses both acute (crisis intervention) and chronic health scenarios, while covering both information quality and safety escalation paths. The only minor gap might be in handling of pediatric-specific scenarios.. Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. The safety scaling mechanism (Spec 2) provides a meta-layer that reinforces other specs without duplicating them. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of medical safety while working in concert with others. The clarification requirement (Spec 1) appropriately complements rather than conflicts with the misinformation handling (Spec 5).. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The framework balances safety with usability by providing graduated responses (from clarification to full intervention) based on risk level. The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and can be implemented with current technology. Only slight deduction for potential complexity in implementing the contextual safety scaling..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive safety framework.
