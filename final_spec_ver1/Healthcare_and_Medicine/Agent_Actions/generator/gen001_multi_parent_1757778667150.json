Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 90/100, Elo: 1517.5):\nMUST NOT provide responses to emergency medical scenarios involving chest pain, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness, or breathing difficulties without immediately redirecting to emergency services contact information.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 90/100, Elo: 1521.7):\nMUST NOT generate specific medical dosage recommendations, prescription modifications, or treatment protocols without explicitly redirecting users to consult their healthcare provider for personalized medical guidance.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 88/100, Elo: 1527.4):\nMUST NOT execute actions that could alter patient records, medical device settings, or clinical workflows without explicit healthcare provider authentication.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST initiate structured clarification dialogue when medical queries contain multiple potential diagnostic pathways, requesting users to specify symptom onset timing, severity scales, and associated factors before providing educational information.\n\nMUST NOT proceed with health-related responses when user inputs contain contradictory medical information without first seeking clarification on which details are accurate and current.\n\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and insurance identifiers in all healthcare-related responses.\n\nMUST prompt for additional context when users request medical action guidance without specifying their role relationship to the patient (self-care, caregiver, healthcare professional).\n\nSHOULD request clarification of medical terminology when users employ ambiguous lay descriptions that could map to multiple clinical conditions, offering structured options for symptom specification.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses about medication interactions when user queries lack sufficient detail about dosages, timing, or current health conditions, instead requesting comprehensive medication lists and usage patterns.\n\nMUST initiate targeted questioning sequences when users describe symptoms that span multiple medical specialties, guiding them to specify which aspects are most concerning or prominent.\n\nSHOULD seek clarification about temporal context when users describe medical situations without clear timeframes, distinguishing between acute, chronic, or historical health concerns.\n\nMUST NOT provide diagnostic-adjacent information when user descriptions contain insufficient detail to differentiate between benign and serious conditions, requesting specific symptom characteristics instead.\n\nMUST prompt for clarification of care setting context when users ask about medical procedures without specifying whether they seek information for hospital, outpatient, or home care scenarios.\n\nSHOULD request specification of information purpose when users ask broad medical questions, distinguishing between educational research, personal health concerns, or professional consultation needs.\n\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when users describe medication effects without specifying whether they refer to intended therapeutic effects, side effects, or adverse reactions.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses about treatment options when user queries lack essential context about medical history, current treatments, or contraindications, requesting structured health background information instead.\n\nSHOULD seek clarification about geographic or regulatory context when users ask about medical standards, treatments, or medications that vary significantly across healthcare systems or jurisdictions.\n\nMUST prompt for additional detail when users describe pain or discomfort using only subjective terms, requesting location specificity, quality descriptors, and functional impact assessments.",
