  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive healthcare safety framework. They build upon each other effectively - from data handling (SPEC 2, 5) to content generation (SPEC 1, 4) to user interaction patterns (SPEC 3, 6). The policies create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent focus on patient safety and regulatory compliance.. Coverage: The policy set shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like medication safety, patient data protection, vulnerable populations, and attempt bypassing. It covers primary scenarios (basic medical advice), secondary concerns (API security), and edge cases (prompt injection, role-playing attempts). The inclusion of both technical (SPEC 5) and content-based (SPEC 15) protections is particularly comprehensive.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (multiple specs addressing safety bypassing: 6, 14, 16) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional overlap exists in authentication and verification requirements, which is appropriate for healthcare safety. There's slight potential for consolidation between SPECs 14 and 16, but the redundancy serves a protective purpose.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable items and specific technical requirements. They balance security needs with practical usage (like SPEC 10's proactive information gathering). The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts while maintaining HIPAA compliance. The verification and validation requirements are specific and measurable..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive healthcare safety f...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like medic...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST automatically cross-validate any generated medication information against current FDA databases and drug interactio...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT execute any healthcare-related actions involving patient data transmission, appointment scheduling, or medical ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 94/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical progression from general medical guid...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: Excellent coverage of major risk areas including general medical advice, emergency situations, pregn...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 90): MUST NOT generate specific medical dosage recommendations, prescription modifications, or treatment protocols without ex...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST initiate clarifying dialogue when medical queries contain ambiguous symptom descriptions that could indicate multip...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive safety framework.
