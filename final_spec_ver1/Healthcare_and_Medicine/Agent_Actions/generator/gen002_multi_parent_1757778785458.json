  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 6-spec group. Average group score: 94.0/100. Cohesion: The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical progression from general medical guidance (Spec 1) to specific high-risk scenarios (Specs 4,5). The policies build upon each other, with contextual safety scaling (Spec 3) complementing the clarification requirements (Specs 2,6). The group shows strong internal consistency in prioritizing patient safety and professional medical consultation.. Coverage: Excellent coverage of major risk areas including general medical advice, emergency situations, pregnancy, mental health, and ambiguous symptoms. The policies address both acute (crisis intervention) and chronic care scenarios, while covering special populations (pregnant women). The multi-dimensional clarification requirement (Spec 6) helps catch edge cases. Only minor gaps in specialized medical domains.. Redundancy: The specs show strategic redundancy in safety-critical areas without excessive overlap. While Specs 2 and 6 both address clarification, they serve distinct purposes (symptom ambiguity vs. temporal uncertainty). The policies reinforce critical safety measures while maintaining unique focuses. The redundancy appears intentional and beneficial for risk management.. Practicality: Highly implementable requirements with clear, actionable guidelines. The specs provide concrete triggers for safety measures (e.g., detecting self-harm queries, pregnancy-related topics) and specific response protocols. The contextual scaling approach allows for flexible application while maintaining safety. The clarification requirements may slightly impact response speed but are necessary for safety..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive safety framework.
