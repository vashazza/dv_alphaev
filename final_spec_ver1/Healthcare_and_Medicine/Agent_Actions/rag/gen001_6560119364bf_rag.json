    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework that progressively scales from general medical guidance (Spec 1) to specific high-risk scenarios (Specs 4,5). They share a common theme of risk mitigation through appropriate redirections and demonstrate logical connections in how they handle increasing levels of medical severity. The contextual safety scaling (Spec 3) acts as a unifying principle that ties the other specifications together.",
    "coverage": "The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across the healthcare domain, addressing general medical advice, diagnostic uncertainty, pregnancy-specific concerns, mental health emergencies, and severity-based response scaling. It covers both physical and mental health domains, acute and chronic scenarios, and special populations. The only minor gap might be in handling emergency physical trauma scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "The specifications show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec addresses a distinct aspect of healthcare interactions, with complementary rather than duplicative coverage. The contextual safety scaling (Spec 3) appropriately reinforces the protective measures in other specs without creating redundancy.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. They balance safety with usability by allowing information sharing while maintaining clear boundaries. The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts and provide concrete actions (e.g., redirecting to specific resources, initiating clarifying dialogue)."
