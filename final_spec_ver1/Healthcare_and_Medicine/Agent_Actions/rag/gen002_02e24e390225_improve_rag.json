    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive safety framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider authority (specs 2,7,18), maintain clear boundaries between education and clinical care (specs 1,12,13), and show coherent progression from detection to response protocols. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles across different medical scenarios.",
    "coverage": "The policy set demonstrates thorough coverage across critical healthcare domains including medication safety (9,11,18), vulnerable populations (8), mental health (14), emergency scenarios (6), and data privacy (16). It addresses both direct medical actions and potential circumvention attempts (4,17). The inclusion of specialist referral protocols (5) and emotional support considerations (14) shows attention to secondary scenarios. Only minor gaps exist in specific procedural documentation requirements.",
    "redundancy": "The policies show strategic redundancy in critical areas like prompt injection protection (4,17) and diagnostic safety (3,12,13) without excessive overlap. While there is some intentional reinforcement of key principles (like provider authorization), it serves to strengthen rather than duplicate protection. The overlap between specs 4 and 17 could potentially be consolidated, but otherwise, the redundancy level is appropriate for the healthcare domain's safety requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are highly implementable, with clear actionable requirements and specific trigger conditions. They balance security with usability by providing structured questioning protocols (11,15) and maintaining supportive dialogue (14). The policies are adaptable across different healthcare contexts while maintaining consistent safety standards. The guided questioning and confirmation protocols make implementation straightforward."
