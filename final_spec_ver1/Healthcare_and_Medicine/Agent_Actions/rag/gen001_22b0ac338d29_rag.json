    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent logical interconnection, forming a comprehensive healthcare safety framework. They build upon each other effectively - from data handling (SPEC 2, 5) to content generation (SPEC 1, 4) to user interaction patterns (SPEC 3, 6). The policies create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent focus on patient safety and regulatory compliance.",
    "coverage": "The policy set shows exceptional coverage across healthcare domains, addressing key areas like medication safety, patient data protection, vulnerable populations, and attempt bypassing. It covers primary scenarios (basic medical advice), secondary concerns (API security), and edge cases (prompt injection, role-playing attempts). The inclusion of both technical (SPEC 5) and content-based (SPEC 15) protections is particularly comprehensive.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (multiple specs addressing safety bypassing: 6, 14, 16) while avoiding excessive overlap. Some intentional overlap exists in authentication and verification requirements, which is appropriate for healthcare safety. There's slight potential for consolidation between SPECs 14 and 16, but the redundancy serves a protective purpose.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable items and specific technical requirements. They balance security needs with practical usage (like SPEC 10's proactive information gathering). The specs are adaptable across different healthcare contexts while maintaining HIPAA compliance. The verification and validation requirements are specific and measurable."
