    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework that addresses healthcare safety from multiple complementary angles. There's a clear logical progression from data validation (Specs 1,4) to access control (Specs 2,16,17), emergency protocols (Specs 11,14), and clinical boundaries (Specs 3,5,6). The specs work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles around healthcare provider authority and patient safety.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across the healthcare domain, addressing pharmaceutical safety, emergency scenarios, patient data protection, clinical workflows, and special populations (pediatric, geriatric, pregnancy). It covers both technical aspects (API credentials, encryption) and clinical concerns (treatment plans, medical documentation). The inclusion of edge cases like attempt detection (Specs 7,8,9) and special populations (Spec 13) demonstrates thorough risk consideration.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like emergency care and provider authorization) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap between Specs 16 and 17 regarding medical device operations, and between Specs 5 and 15 regarding treatment modifications, these redundancies appear intentional for critical safety areas. The majority of specs address distinct aspects of healthcare safety while maintaining consistent underlying principles.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and actionable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The policies balance security with usability by providing alternative pathways (like redirecting to appropriate resources) rather than just blocking actions. The structured questioning protocols (Specs 10,19) and clarification requirements make implementation straightforward. The specs are adaptable to various healthcare contexts while maintaining HIPAA compliance and safety standards."
