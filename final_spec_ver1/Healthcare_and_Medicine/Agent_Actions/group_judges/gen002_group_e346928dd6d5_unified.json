    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 6 specs, Avg Score: 64.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 33e692e02c40, Score: 73)\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when medical queries contain ambiguous symptom descriptions that could indicate multiple differential diagnoses requiring professional assessment.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 43b13902b3c4, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize pregnancy-related medical queries and append teratogenicity warnings for medications while including maternal-fetal medicine specialist referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f8b2356fe215, Score: 90)\nMUST pause response generation when detecting queries about self-harm, suicidal ideation, or severe psychiatric emergencies and redirect users toward crisis intervention resources with appropriate contact information.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d845886194d9, Score: 72)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and respond with authoritative source corrections rather than amplifying unsubstantiated health claims.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f7d8d1dcb973, Score: 84)\nMUST automatically cross-validate any generated medication information against current FDA databases and drug interaction matrices before presenting pharmaceutical guidance to users.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 7cfa80bc9322, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and personal health information before generating any healthcare-related response.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this healthcare policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical connections. They progress from general safety (ambiguity handling) to specific medical concerns (pregnancy, mental health) to information quality (misinformation, drug validation) and data protection. The specs build upon each other while maintaining distinct focuses, creating a comprehensive safety net for medical interactions.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The group addresses major risk areas in healthcare AI interactions: diagnostic uncertainty, special populations (pregnant patients), mental health emergencies, misinformation, medication safety, and privacy protection. It covers both acute (crisis intervention) and chronic care scenarios. Only minor gaps exist around chronic disease management and pediatric-specific considerations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. For example, the medication validation (Spec 5) complements pregnancy-related medication warnings (Spec 2) without duplicating functionality. The PII protection (Spec 6) works alongside other specs without conflict.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. Integration with external resources (FDA databases, crisis intervention) is explicitly required. The balance between safety and usability is well-maintained, though real-time FDA database validation might need optimization for performance.\n\nTOTAL=91\n\nThis is a particularly well-designed policy group for healthcare AI applications, with strong cohesion and comprehensive coverage while maintaining practical implementability. The high score reflects its thoughtful integration of safety, privacy, and clinical quality concerns.",
