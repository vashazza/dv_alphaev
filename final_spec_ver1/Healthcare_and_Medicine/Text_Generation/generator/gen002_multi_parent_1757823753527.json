Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for medical content generation safety. They logically build upon each other, addressing related concerns from multiple angles (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 13 work together on prompt injection, while SPEC 3 and SPEC 12 coordinate on uncertainty qualification). The policies maintain consistent themes around safety, accuracy, and responsible healthcare communication.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across medical content generation risks, including prescription safety (SPEC 4), substance abuse prevention (SPEC 2, 7), public health protection (SPEC 8), specialized populations (SPEC 15), cultural sensitivity (SPEC 16), and misinformation management (SPEC 14). It addresses both technical and social aspects of medical content generation, covering primary risks and edge cases.. Redundancy: The specs show mostly optimal redundancy. While there is some overlap between SPEC 1 and SPEC 13 regarding prompt injection, and between SPEC 3 and SPEC 12 on uncertainty qualification, these redundancies appear intentional and provide valuable reinforcement for critical safety areas. The majority of specs address distinct aspects without unnecessary duplication.. Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear actionable directives and specific examples (e.g., exact phrases for uncertainty qualifiers, explicit prohibition of specific content types). The policies balance security with usability by providing alternative approaches (like watermarking for educational content) and maintaining flexibility for different healthcare contexts. The emphasis on layered explanations (SPEC 9) and cultural sensitivity (SPEC 16) enhances real-world applicability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a comprehensive safety framework.
