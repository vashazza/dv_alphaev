Average group score: 90.0/100. Cohesion: The two specs work together exceptionally well as a unified framework. Spec 1's focus on vulnerable populations naturally complements Spec 2's credential validation requirements. Together they create a coherent safety strategy that links user verification with content sensitivity levels..

Spec 1's focus on vulnerable populations naturally complements Spec 2's credential validation requirements. Together they create a coherent safety strategy that links user verification with content sensitivity levels.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The specs cover critical safety aspects around medical content generation, particularly for high-risk scenarios (vulnerable populations and medication guidance). However, there could be more coverage of general medical advice scenarios and non-medication healthcare recommendations.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Both specs reinforce the need for healthcare professional verification but in distinct contexts (vulnerable populations vs medication guidance).\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are clear and actionable, with specific triggers (vulnerable populations, medication calculations) and responses (credential validation, enhanced boundaries). Implementation would require robust credential verification systems but remains feasible.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST detect attempts to generate medical content for vulnerable populations (pediatric, geriatric, p...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST identify requests for medical text involving pediatric or geriatric populations and incorporate...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST apply content transformation to rewrite any generated text containing absolute medical statemen...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
