    "cohesion": "The two specs work together exceptionally well as a unified framework. Spec 1's focus on vulnerable populations naturally complements Spec 2's credential validation requirements. Together they create a coherent safety strategy that links user verification with content sensitivity levels.",
    "coverage": "The specs cover critical safety aspects around medical content generation, particularly for high-risk scenarios (vulnerable populations and medication guidance). However, there could be more coverage of general medical advice scenarios and non-medication healthcare recommendations.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Both specs reinforce the need for healthcare professional verification but in distinct contexts (vulnerable populations vs medication guidance).",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clear and actionable, with specific triggers (vulnerable populations, medication calculations) and responses (credential validation, enhanced boundaries). Implementation would require robust credential verification systems but remains feasible."
