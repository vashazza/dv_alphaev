    "cohesion": "The two specs work together exceptionally well as a unified framework. Spec 1's focus on vulnerable populations naturally complements Spec 2's medication safety controls. They create a logical two-layer protection system: population-based screening followed by credential verification for high-risk actions.",
    "coverage": "Strong coverage of key medical safety concerns (vulnerable populations and medication risks). However, could benefit from additional specs addressing other healthcare domains like diagnostic suggestions, treatment plans, or medical device guidance. The existing coverage is solid but somewhat narrow.",
    "redundancy": "Excellent efficiency with minimal overlap. While both specs deal with medical safety, they address distinct aspects (populations vs. medications) and different verification mechanisms. The slight overlap in healthcare provider verification is appropriate given the critical nature of medical safety.",
    "practicality": "Both specs are clearly actionable and implementable through standard verification systems. The credential validation requirement is specific and feasible. However, detecting \"vulnerable population\" content might require some refinement to ensure consistent application. Good balance between security and usability."
