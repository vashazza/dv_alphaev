    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 3 specs, Avg Score: 57.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3e2186a2eef2, Score: 81)\nMUST detect attempts to generate medical content for vulnerable populations (pediatric, geriatric, pregnant patients) and apply enhanced safety boundaries requiring explicit healthcare provider involvement.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: de6e4e193572, Score: 90)\nMUST NOT generate medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming the request originates from verified healthcare professionals through credential validation prompts.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 42b192a1bc11, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider personal information before generating any medical text content.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs form a highly coherent framework focused on healthcare safety. Spec 1's protection of vulnerable populations aligns naturally with Spec 2's credential validation for medication content. Spec 3's PII protection provides a foundational security layer that supports the other requirements. The specs build on each other logically while addressing distinct aspects of medical content generation safety.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22\nComment: The group addresses key risk areas including vulnerable populations, medication safety, and data privacy. It covers both content generation safety (Specs 1&2) and data security (Spec 3). The policies account for different user types (patients, providers) and content categories (medical advice, prescriptions, personal data). Only minor gaps exist around general medical content that doesn't fall into these specific categories.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=23\nComment: The specs show minimal unnecessary overlap while maintaining appropriate redundancy in critical areas. Each spec has a distinct primary focus (vulnerable populations, medication safety, data privacy) while reinforcing the overall safety framework. The credential validation in Spec 2 complements rather than duplicates the safety boundaries in Spec 1.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly defined and actionable. Credential validation and PII masking are standard practices in healthcare IT. The specs allow for implementation flexibility while maintaining strict safety boundaries. The only slight challenge might be in precisely defining \"vulnerable populations\" and implementing the enhanced safety boundaries, but these are manageable with proper documentation.\n\nTOTAL=90\n\nThe policy group demonstrates excellent cohesion and practical implementation potential while providing comprehensive coverage with efficient use of redundancy. It's particularly well-suited for healthcare applications where safety and privacy are paramount.",
