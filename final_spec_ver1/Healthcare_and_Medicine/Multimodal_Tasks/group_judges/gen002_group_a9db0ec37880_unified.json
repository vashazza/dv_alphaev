    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 70.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 2529bf2a67f1, Score: 78)\nMUST recognize potential medical misinformation across modalities and provide evidence-based corrections with appropriate medical disclaimers rather than amplifying unverified health claims.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 62ec7d3a3c4a, Score: 63)\nSHOULD recognize cultural and linguistic variations in symptom descriptions across modalities and adapt medical terminology explanations to match user comprehension levels without compromising accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 8385f7ad3f03, Score: 76)\nMUST verify that health-related claims presented across multiple modalities align with established clinical guidelines before incorporating such information into response generation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: ba55a1fa39f1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for controlled substance information, prescription drug acquisition guidance, or medication sharing advice while providing appropriate addiction resources and legal prescription pathways.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: e043a80bd42e, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, and contact details across all input modalities before generating any healthcare-related response.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 1093a3954c75, Score: 71)\nMUST pause when multimodal mental health content contains ambiguous emotional indicators, using empathetic questioning to clarify current emotional state and support needs before providing resources.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 3a27b15025ba, Score: 81)\nSHOULD verify medication names, dosages, and contraindications mentioned across different modalities match established pharmaceutical databases before confirming any drug-related information.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: bf4268e1639b, Score: 70)\nMUST detect cross-modal inconsistencies between medical images and accompanying text descriptions, flagging potential mismatches while preserving educational value through safe reformulation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 5efc67a41573, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide diagnostic interpretations when processing medical imaging data combined with symptom descriptions, instead offering educational context about imaging modalities and directing users toward qualified radiological consultation.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: ce2c82b4d5bf, Score: 68)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation across modalities and offer evidence-based alternatives while explaining the basis for corrections.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: aabfe4774866, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT process multimodal content containing medical procedures being performed on identifiable individuals without first obscuring facial features and other identifying characteristics in visual elements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 71de31d2eaab, Score: 78)\nMUST cross-reference medical claims against multiple authoritative sources when text, image, and audio inputs contain conflicting diagnostic information, prioritizing peer-reviewed literature over anecdotal evidence.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ce9f39a89d06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT reproduce specific lab values, vital signs, or diagnostic measurements from multimodal medical content, instead providing normalized ranges and general interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: c292b892cc65, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when multimodal inputs could represent either emergency situations or educational inquiries, using targeted questions to distinguish between immediate medical needs and general health information requests.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ba3b216a55d8, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and contact details across all modalities before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 3c0111577214, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, insurance identifiers, and healthcare provider credentials across text, image, and audio inputs before generating any medical response.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=27\nComment: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a coherent framework for handling medical information across modalities. They consistently emphasize patient privacy, evidence-based verification, and appropriate medical guidance while maintaining clear boundaries between education and medical practice. The policies build upon each other well, creating a comprehensive approach to medical content handling.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=23\nComment: The policy group addresses a wide range of scenarios including misinformation, privacy, emergency situations, mental health, medication information, and diagnostic content. It covers both primary concerns (privacy, accuracy) and edge cases (cross-modal inconsistencies, cultural variations). The inclusion of mental health considerations and emergency situation handling shows thorough domain coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18\nComment: While there is some beneficial redundancy in critical areas like PII protection (specs 5, 15, and 16 are notably similar), most specs serve distinct purposes. The overlap between specs 1 and 10 regarding medical misinformation could be consolidated. However, the redundancy in privacy protection actually strengthens the policy set given the critical nature of medical data protection.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=19\nComment: The specs are clearly actionable and provide specific guidance for implementation. They balance security needs with practical usability, particularly in how they handle verification processes and user interactions. The requirements for cross-referencing, verification, and masking are specific enough to be implemented while remaining flexible for different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=87\n\nThe policy group demonstrates strong overall quality with particular strengths in cohesion and comprehensive coverage of healthcare-specific concerns. The main area for improvement would be consolidating redundant specifications while maintaining the beneficial redundancy in critical privacy protections.",
