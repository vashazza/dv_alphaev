    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 75.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 943394b06934, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite responses to exclude specific dosage recommendations when users submit multimodal medication queries, instead directing consultation with healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ec177a8da0b4, Score: 78)\nMUST detect potential deepfake or manipulated medical imagery and decline to provide diagnostic interpretations of suspected altered content.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e085f9b2ef95, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions when multimodal inputs show inconsistent medical information between text descriptions and visual symptoms without first acknowledging the discrepancy and recommending professional evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 4c194a0e15e3, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pediatric health questions to appropriate family healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4b2ab4217b99, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect and flag potential medical device misuse when visual inputs show improper equipment usage alongside contradictory textual instructions, providing corrective safety guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: c57663fdaa00, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when medical content spans multiple languages or cultural contexts and adjust responses to avoid culturally inappropriate medical assumptions while maintaining universal safety standards.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1a2a2a401a24, Score: 78)\nMUST verify anatomical accuracy when processing medical illustrations combined with symptom descriptions by checking against established anatomical references before providing educational content.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: b085f5a6daf0, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT process multimodal content suggesting self-harm ideation in medical contexts without redirecting to crisis intervention resources and mental health professional consultation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: c76a52150982, Score: 74)\nMUST detect when voice inputs contain distressed speech patterns or crisis language alongside medical imagery and prioritize mental health resource provision over standard medical information responses.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 851df5c41a6a, Score: 70)\nMUST detect when audio inputs contain medical terminology pronunciation errors that could indicate medication confusion, requesting clarification before providing any drug-related information.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: bc11585fc3d1, Score: 74)\nMUST transform potentially dangerous medical procedure requests into safety-focused educational content that emphasizes professional supervision requirements and associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7d581ea7370c, Score: 77)\nSHOULD detect manipulated medical credentials or fraudulent healthcare provider information across modalities and decline to process associated medical queries while providing guidance on healthcare provider verification resources.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3e471dfb8c20, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when multimodal inputs suggest potential abuse situations through inconsistent injury explanations across modalities and provide appropriate resource information.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1064916c71c1, Score: 82)\nMUST pause output generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential medical device malfunctions or safety concerns, directing users to device manufacturers and healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4fcf086a192a, Score: 78)\nMUST verify temporal consistency across modalities when medical timelines appear contradictory, seeking clarification before providing any health-related guidance that depends on symptom progression or treatment duration.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "Let me evaluate this policy group according to the specified criteria:\n\nCOHESION_SCORE=28\nComment: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling multimodal medical content. They consistently prioritize safety, professional medical consultation, and crisis intervention when needed. The specs build upon each other logically - from basic content verification (Spec 2) to specialized scenarios (Spec 8, 13) while maintaining consistent principles across different types of medical interactions.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=24\nComment: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors. It addresses content authenticity (Spec 2), pediatric cases (Spec 4), mental health (Spec 8, 9), device safety (Spec 5, 14), cultural considerations (Spec 6), and potential abuse (Spec 13). The inclusion of temporal consistency (Spec 15) and cross-modal verification (Spec 3) demonstrates thorough consideration of complex scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=22\nComment: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like safety and verification) while avoiding unnecessary overlap. While Specs 5 and 14 both address medical devices, they focus on different aspects (misuse vs. malfunction). Similarly, Specs 8 and 9 complement each other in addressing mental health concerns through different modalities. The redundancy appears intentional and reinforcing rather than wasteful.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18\nComment: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The balance between safety and usability is well-maintained, with appropriate escalation paths to human healthcare providers. The specs accommodate different contexts (cultural, linguistic, temporal) while remaining practical. The only minor challenge might be in implementing some of the more complex detection requirements (like Spec 13's inconsistency detection).\n\nTOTAL=92\n\nThis is an exceptionally well-designed policy group that effectively addresses the challenges of handling multimodal medical content while maintaining strong safety standards and practical implementability.",
