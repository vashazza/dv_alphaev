    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare safety framework. They consistently emphasize patient safety, proper medical oversight, and appropriate redirections. The policies build on each other logically - from general safety (Spec 3) to specific scenarios (Specs 9, 12, 13), while maintaining consistent principles around validation, verification, and protective measures.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare scenarios, addressing vulnerable populations (elderly, minors, mental health patients), various medical content types (imaging, genetic tests, device data), and different risk levels (emergency, routine, crisis). It covers both technical aspects (PII protection, prompt injection) and clinical concerns (drug interactions, diagnostic criteria). Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and cross-border medical advice.",
    "redundancy": "The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (emergency response, vulnerable populations) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap between Specs 8 and 5 regarding symptom validation, and between Specs 9 and 13 regarding crisis response, these redundancies serve as important safety backups rather than inefficiencies. The group maintains good balance between unique requirements and reinforcing critical safety measures.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific triggers for different scenarios. They provide concrete guidance for handling various medical situations while maintaining flexibility for different healthcare contexts. The specs are written in actionable terms (MUST, SHOULD) with clear conditions and responses. The only minor challenge might be in real-time implementation of some of the more complex validation requirements."
