    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for healthcare-related multimodal interactions. They consistently emphasize protection of vulnerable populations (Specs 1, 12, 14), handle emergency scenarios (Specs 10, 13, 15), and maintain a unified approach to medical data validation (Specs 2, 5, 7). The policies work together seamlessly to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles across different medical scenarios.",
    "coverage": "The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare scenarios, including vulnerable populations, emergency situations, medical device data, psychiatric care, pediatric cases, and reproductive health. It addresses both direct medical risks (drug interactions, diagnostic information) and indirect risks (misinformation, prompt injection). The only minor gap might be in handling multi-party medical consultations or telemedicine-specific scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "The policies show appropriate redundancy in critical areas like emergency response (Specs 10, 13, 15) and vulnerable population protection (Specs 1, 12, 14) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap in validation requirements (Specs 3, 5, 8), this redundancy appears intentional for safety-critical scenarios. The redundancies present serve to strengthen the safety framework rather than create inefficiencies.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are highly implementable, with clear triggers and actions. They provide specific guidance for handling different scenarios while remaining flexible enough for various healthcare contexts. The requirements for pausing, validation, and redirection are well-defined and actionable. The emphasis on established medical guidelines and professional oversight makes these policies practical for real-world implementation."
