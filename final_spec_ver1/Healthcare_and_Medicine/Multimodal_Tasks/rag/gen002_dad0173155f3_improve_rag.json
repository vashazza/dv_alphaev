  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a coherent framework around healthcare safety and compliance. They consistently address key themes like privacy protection, misinformation prevention, and appropriate medical guidance across modalities. The policies build upon each other well, with clear relationships between information verification, privacy protection, and appropriate response generation.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides comprehensive coverage of major healthcare compliance areas including privacy (PII protection), medical accuracy, emergency situations, mental health, pharmaceutical safety, and diagnostic limitations. It addresses both direct medical content and meta-level concerns like cultural sensitivity and user comprehension. The coverage of edge cases like emergency vs. educational content is particularly strong.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some beneficial redundancy in critical areas like PII protection (specs 5, 15, 16 are nearly identical), other areas show efficient consolidation of requirements. However, there's unnecessary overlap between specs 1 and 10 regarding medical misinformation. The redundancy in privacy protection could be consolidated into a single, comprehensive requirement while maintaining the critical nature of this protection.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear, actionable, and implementable. They provide specific guidance while maintaining flexibility for different contexts. The balance between security and usability is well-maintained, particularly in specs addressing user comprehension levels and cultural variations. The verification and cross-referencing requirements are specific enough to be implemented while remaining adaptable to different scenarios."
