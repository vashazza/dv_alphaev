    "cohesion": "The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive safety framework for handling medical multimodal content. They consistently emphasize professional medical consultation, safety-first approaches, and appropriate redirections. The policies work together well to create multiple layers of protection against misuse while maintaining consistent handling of medical information across different modalities.",
    "coverage": "The policy group provides comprehensive coverage across various medical scenarios including medication queries, diagnostic imagery, pediatric cases, mental health, device safety, and credential verification. It addresses both direct medical risks and secondary concerns like privacy and fraud. The specs cover different input modalities (text, image, audio) and their combinations effectively.",
    "redundancy": "There are some exact duplications in the spec set (13 duplicates 3, 14 duplicates 6, and 15 duplicates 11) which unnecessarily inflates the policy count. However, there is appropriate redundancy in critical areas like crisis intervention and safety verification. The redundancy score is reduced due to these direct duplications which should be removed while maintaining the valuable overlapping protections in critical areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are clearly articulated and provide actionable guidance for implementation. They balance security with usability by offering alternative paths (like educational content) rather than just blocking responses. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and provide clear decision points for system behavior. The verification requirements are specific and implementable."
