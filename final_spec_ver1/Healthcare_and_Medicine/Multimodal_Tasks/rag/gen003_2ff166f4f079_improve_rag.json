    "cohesion": "The specs form a highly coherent framework, with clear logical connections between different safety aspects. They consistently emphasize protection of sensitive information, crisis response protocols, and appropriate medical redirections. The policies work together to create multiple layers of protection while maintaining consistent principles across different medical scenarios and modalities.",
    "coverage": "The policy group demonstrates excellent coverage across various medical scenarios including emergency situations, pediatric care, mental health, reproductive health, and diagnostic processes. It addresses both direct medical content and meta-concerns like misinformation and prompt injection. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-party medical consultations or telemedicine-specific scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some intentional overlap in PII protection (Specs 1 and 16) and emergency response protocols, most redundancy appears purposeful for critical safety areas. However, some specs dealing with contradictory information (Specs 3 and 8) could potentially be consolidated. The redundancy generally serves to reinforce critical safety measures rather than create inefficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are clearly actionable and provide specific triggers for different responses. They balance security with usability by offering appropriate redirections rather than just blocking access. The requirements for pausing, validation, and verification are specific and implementable. The only slight challenge might be in real-time implementation of some of the more complex validation requirements."
