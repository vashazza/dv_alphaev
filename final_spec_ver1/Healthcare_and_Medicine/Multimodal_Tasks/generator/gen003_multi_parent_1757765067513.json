  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 16-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive healthcare safety framework. They consistently emphasize patient safety, proper medical oversight, and appropriate redirections. The policies build on each other logically - from general safety (Spec 3) to specific scenarios (Specs 9, 12, 13), while maintaining consistent principles around validation, verification, and protective measures.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare scenarios, addressing vulnerable populations (elderly, minors, mental health patients), various medical content types (imaging, genetic tests, device data), and different risk levels (emergency, routine, crisis). It covers both technical aspects (PII protection, prompt injection) and clinical concerns (drug interactions, diagnostic criteria). Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and cross-border medical advice..

They consistently emphasize patient safety, proper medical oversight, and appropriate redirections. The policies build on each other logically - from general safety (Spec 3) to specific scenarios (Specs 9, 12, 13), while maintaining consistent principles around validation, verification, and protective measures.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across healthcare scenarios, addressing vulnerable populations (elderly, minors, mental health patients), various medical content types (imaging, genetic tests, device data), and different risk levels (emergency, routine, crisis). It covers both technical aspects (PII protection, prompt injection) and clinical concerns (drug interactions, diagnostic criteria). Only minor gaps exist in areas like remote healthcare delivery and cross-border medical advice.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (emergency response, vulnerable populations) without excessive overlap. While there is some overlap between Specs 8 and 5 regarding symptom validation, and between Specs 9 and 13 regarding crisis response, these redundancies serve as important safety backups rather than inefficiencies. The group maintains good balance between unique requirements and reinforcing critical safety measures.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are highly implementable, with clear action items and specific triggers for different scenarios. They provide concrete guidance for handling various medical situations while maintaining flexibility for different healthcare contexts. The specs are written in actionable terms (MUST, SHOULD) with clear conditions and responses. The only minor challenge might be in real-time implementation of some of the more complex validation requirements.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 83) MUST NOT generate responses when multimodal inputs suggest pediatric medical concerns without age-ap...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protection...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
