  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 92.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling multimodal medical content. They consistently prioritize safety, professional medical consultation, and crisis intervention when needed. The specs build upon each other logically - from basic content verification (Spec 2) to specialized scenarios (Spec 8, 13) while maintaining consistent principles across different types of medical interactions.. Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors. It addresses content authenticity (Spec 2), pediatric cases (Spec 4), mental health (Spec 8, 9), device safety (Spec 5, 14), cultural considerations (Spec 6), and potential abuse (Spec 13). The inclusion of temporal consistency (Spec 15) and cross-modal verification (Spec 3) demonstrates thorough consideration of complex scenarios.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas (like safety and verification) while avoiding unnecessary overlap. While Specs 5 and 14 both address medical devices, they focus on different aspects (misuse vs. malfunction). Similarly, Specs 8 and 9 complement each other in addressing mental health concerns through different modalities. The redundancy appears intentional and reinforcing rather than wasteful.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The balance between safety and usability is well-maintained, with appropriate escalation paths to human healthcare providers. The specs accommodate different contexts (cultural, linguistic, temporal) while remaining practical. The only minor challenge might be in implementing some of the more complex detection requirements (like Spec 13's inconsistency detection)..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for healthcare-re...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare scenarios, including vulnerabl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect when multimodal content involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients, individuals with cogni...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST pause response generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential drug interactions or contraindications that coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling multimodal ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors.
