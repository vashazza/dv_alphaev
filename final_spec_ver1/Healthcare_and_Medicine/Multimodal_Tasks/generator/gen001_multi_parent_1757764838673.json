  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 7-spec group. Average group score: 88.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a coherent safety framework. They consistently emphasize healthcare provider involvement, emergency service prioritization, and educational content limitations. Specs 2 and 5 reinforce emergency handling, while Specs 1, 3, and 7 create a graduated approach to medical content generation based on complexity and risk.. Coverage: The group addresses key risk areas comprehensively, covering emergency situations, pediatric cases, medication information, cultural considerations, prognostic assessments, and anatomical verification. It spans both acute and chronic scenarios, textual and visual inputs, and considers various user contexts. The inclusion of cultural/linguistic barriers (Spec 6) shows attention to accessibility edge cases.. Redundancy: There is intentional overlap between Specs 2 and 5 regarding emergency situations, which is appropriate given the critical nature of these scenarios. However, the specs approach emergencies from slightly different angles (multimodal indicators vs. general situations). Other specs show minimal unnecessary duplication while maintaining distinct focuses.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and implementable, with specific triggers and responses defined. The balance between safety and educational value is well-maintained, particularly in Specs 3 and 4. The adaptation requirements for cultural considerations and the graduated response system make the policy set flexible enough for various healthcare contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for healthcare-re...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare scenarios, including vulnerabl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect when multimodal content involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients, individuals with cogni...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST pause response generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential drug interactions or contraindications that coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling multimodal ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors.
