  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 93.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for handling medical content. They consistently emphasize protection of vulnerable populations (minors, psychiatric patients), handle emergency scenarios, and maintain data privacy. The specs build on each other logically, with clear connections between related areas like crisis response (SPEC 9, 13, 15) and pediatric care (SPEC 12, 14).. Coverage: The policy group provides exceptional coverage across critical healthcare domains including PII protection, drug safety, diagnostic procedures, emergency response, mental health, pediatrics, and medical device data. It addresses various input modalities (text, image, audio) and covers both routine and crisis scenarios. The only minor gap might be in handling multi-party medical consultations or telemedicine-specific scenarios.. Redundancy: The specs show appropriate redundancy in critical areas like emergency response and minor protection without excessive overlap. While there is some intentional overlap between crisis-related specs (9, 13, 15) and pediatric care specs (12, 14), this redundancy serves a protective purpose. The PII protection and safety validation mechanisms are efficiently distributed across relevant specs.. Practicality: The requirements are clearly actionable and specific, with concrete triggers for pausing, redirecting, or blocking responses. They balance security with usability by providing alternative paths (like redirecting to appropriate resources) rather than just blocking actions. The specs are adaptable to different healthcare contexts and technical implementations. Implementation complexity is managed through clear decision points and actions..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling multimodal ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors.
