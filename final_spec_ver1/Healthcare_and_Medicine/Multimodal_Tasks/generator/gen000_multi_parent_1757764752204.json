  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 88.0/100. Cohesion: The specs demonstrate strong logical connections and form a cohesive framework for handling medical information across modalities. They consistently emphasize privacy protection, evidence-based verification, and appropriate medical guidance while maintaining clear boundaries between education and medical practice. The policies build upon each other well, with complementary requirements for handling different aspects of medical content.. Coverage: The policy group provides comprehensive coverage of key healthcare compliance areas including privacy protection, misinformation handling, emergency situations, mental health considerations, and pharmaceutical information. It addresses both common scenarios and edge cases like cross-modal inconsistencies and cultural variations. The only minor gap might be in specific protocols for handling real-time medical device data.. Redundancy: While there is some overlap between specs (particularly regarding PII masking in specs 5 and 15, and misinformation handling in specs 1 and 10), most redundancies appear intentional and serve to reinforce critical safety requirements. However, these overlapping specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising safety.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with specific guidance on how to handle different scenarios. They maintain a good balance between security and usability, particularly in distinguishing between emergency and educational contexts. The specs are adaptable to various healthcare settings, though some might require significant computational resources to implement effectively..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 93/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive safety framework for healthcare-re...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various healthcare scenarios, including vulnerabl...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect when multimodal content involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients, individuals with cogni...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST pause response generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential drug interactions or contraindications that coul...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 92/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs demonstrate excellent cohesion, forming a comprehensive framework for handling multimodal ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group shows exceptional coverage across various medical scenarios and risk vectors.
