    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial communication compliance. They address various aspects of communication, such as regulatory compliance, user intent verification, and risk assessment. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 14, SPEC 11 and SPEC 15, SPEC 1 and SPEC 16, SPEC 7 and SPEC 17), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, user intent, vulnerable populations, and market volatility. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several being repeated verbatim. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the repeated specifications could complicate maintenance and implementation."
