    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial communication compliance. They address various aspects of financial communication, such as regulatory compliance, user intent verification, and data source credibility. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as the repeated specs on masking PII and content generation about cryptocurrency, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, user intent, vulnerable populations, and market volatility. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios, such as more nuanced cross-border transaction considerations or emerging financial technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs 14 and 15, both addressing PII masking, and specs 16 and 17, which are repeated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, the presence of redundant and repeated specs may complicate implementation and maintenance. Additionally, some specs could be more adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory environments or financial product types."
