    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of financial communication, such as regulatory compliance, user intent verification, and risk disclosure. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on professional referrals and educational content. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including crisis-level guidance, tax advice, regulatory compliance, and market volatility. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there are minor gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche investment strategies.",
    "redundancy": "The group avoids significant redundancy, with most specifications addressing unique aspects of financial communication. There is some overlap in areas like user intent verification and educational content transformation, which could be streamlined. The redundancy present is generally appropriate for critical safety areas, ensuring robustness without excessive duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are mostly clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying user intents and financial scenarios. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, particularly those involving nuanced judgment calls, like identifying vulnerable populations or detecting regulatory circumvention attempts."
