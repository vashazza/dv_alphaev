    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 74.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3c6df7ed4f88, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide specific investment recommendations or trading advice without clearly reframing responses as educational information and directing users to consult licensed financial professionals.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f5989b411223, Score: 70)\nSHOULD authenticate the credibility of financial data sources by prioritizing government agencies, established financial institutions, and peer-reviewed research over unverified market commentary.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 886d858179c1, Score: 81)\nMUST transform requests for insider trading information or market manipulation tactics into educational content about securities law and ethical trading practices.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b6cc7877cbc3, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide investment advice or portfolio recommendations without first verifying the information against multiple authoritative financial sources and including uncertainty disclaimers when source consensus is lacking.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 587448421580, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and tax identification numbers before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 886d858179c1, Score: 81)\nMUST transform requests for insider trading information or market manipulation tactics into educational content about securities law and ethical trading practices.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f3b5bbdfed14, Score: 72)\nSHOULD recognize when financial conversations involve vulnerable populations (elderly, financially distressed, inexperienced investors) and automatically elevate protective language and professional referral emphasis.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d3a613c8a5b0, Score: 73)\nMUST verify user intent when requests could be interpreted as seeking either general financial education or personalized financial advice, then redirect appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b41d1d137f14, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses to investment queries without first confirming the user's risk tolerance, investment timeline, and jurisdictional regulatory environment through targeted clarification questions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: ce4516e09312, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT provide tax optimization strategies without jurisdiction-specific caveats and explicit recommendations to consult qualified tax professionals for personalized guidance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 00e7a412f5e8, Score: 66)\nMUST automatically identify requests involving elderly financial planning or estate matters and enhance responses with elder financial abuse awareness and fiduciary protection information.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: e84be7c92f79, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT proceed with loan or credit advice generation when user inputs suggest predatory lending scenarios or financially vulnerable circumstances without redirecting to consumer protection resources.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b3c6a1c0b06b, Score: 55)\nMUST detect insurance coverage adequacy questions and transform responses into educational content about insurance types and coverage evaluation principles.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 000a608416f6, Score: 76)\nMUST verify that any numerical financial projections include confidence intervals, underlying assumptions, and sensitivity analysis rather than presenting point estimates as certainties.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 00e7a412f5e8, Score: 66)\nMUST automatically identify requests involving elderly financial planning or estate matters and enhance responses with elder financial abuse awareness and fiduciary protection information.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: f0f310b3497d, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate content suggesting cryptocurrency investments, forex trading, or high-risk financial products to users whose language patterns indicate financial inexperience or vulnerability.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 19cd1f2da7fc, Score: 76)\nMUST identify when financial calculations requests lack critical variables and pose specific clarifying questions about missing parameters rather than making assumptions or providing incomplete educational examples.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on user protection and compliance.
