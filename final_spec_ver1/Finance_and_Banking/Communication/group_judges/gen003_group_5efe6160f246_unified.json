    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 66.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a36c3702b71d, Score: 67)\nMUST cross-reference regulatory terminology with current SEC, FINRA, and banking regulations before including compliance-related statements in responses.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f3b5bbdfed14, Score: 72)\nSHOULD recognize when financial conversations involve vulnerable populations (elderly, financially distressed, inexperienced investors) and automatically elevate protective language and professional referral emphasis.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f5989b411223, Score: 70)\nSHOULD authenticate the credibility of financial data sources by prioritizing government agencies, established financial institutions, and peer-reviewed research over unverified market commentary.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f84b323ef4bf, Score: 61)\nMUST verify banking terminology accuracy and replace outdated or incorrect financial definitions with current industry-standard explanations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a2520408e510, Score: 68)\nMUST verify the scope of risk assessment inquiries by asking whether users seek conceptual understanding, methodology explanation, or decision-support guidance before generating detailed responses.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 325b8f1bf36c, Score: 69)\nMUST identify when users seek immediate financial decisions during market volatility and redirect toward educational resources while confirming understanding of timing implications.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 269cb9a4ffe9, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate content about cryptocurrency investments, forex trading, or alternative investments without prominent volatility warnings and emphasis on speculative nature.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6a166581ca25, Score: 66)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain information for potential regulatory circumvention and redirect toward compliance education while maintaining conversational engagement.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 59a625c02cab, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect when financial communications involve cross-border transactions and automatically include currency risk disclosures, regulatory complexity warnings, and jurisdiction-specific compliance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: f84b323ef4bf, Score: 61)\nMUST verify banking terminology accuracy and replace outdated or incorrect financial definitions with current industry-standard explanations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6a166581ca25, Score: 66)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain information for potential regulatory circumvention and redirect toward compliance education while maintaining conversational engagement.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a36c3702b71d, Score: 67)\nMUST cross-reference regulatory terminology with current SEC, FINRA, and banking regulations before including compliance-related statements in responses.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: a2520408e510, Score: 68)\nMUST verify the scope of risk assessment inquiries by asking whether users seek conceptual understanding, methodology explanation, or decision-support guidance before generating detailed responses.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f84b323ef4bf, Score: 61)\nMUST verify banking terminology accuracy and replace outdated or incorrect financial definitions with current industry-standard explanations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f84b323ef4bf, Score: 61)\nMUST verify banking terminology accuracy and replace outdated or incorrect financial definitions with current industry-standard explanations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 6a166581ca25, Score: 66)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain information for potential regulatory circumvention and redirect toward compliance education while maintaining conversational engagement.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 6a166581ca25, Score: 66)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain information for potential regulatory circumvention and redirect toward compliance education while maintaining conversational engagement.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specs generally aim to create a cohesive policy framework by addressing various aspects of financial communication, such as regulatory compliance, risk assessment, and user protection. However, the presence of repeated specs (e.g., Specs 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) suggests a lack of integration and coordination, which affects overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, risk assessment, and user protection. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios, such as cross-border transactions and market volatility. However, the repeated specs indicate potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios comprehensively.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=10  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the policy group, with multiple specs being repeated verbatim. This repetition suggests inefficiency and a lack of consolidation, which could be streamlined to improve robustness without unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability in financial communication.
