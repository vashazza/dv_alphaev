    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 69.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a36c3702b71d, Score: 67)\nMUST cross-reference regulatory terminology with current SEC, FINRA, and banking regulations before including compliance-related statements in responses.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 5dd3ac87b0dd, Score: 76)\nMUST verify user intent when financial queries could apply to multiple life stages by asking clarifying questions that distinguish between retirement planning, education funding, or wealth preservation contexts.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f3b5bbdfed14, Score: 72)\nSHOULD recognize when financial conversations involve vulnerable populations (elderly, financially distressed, inexperienced investors) and automatically elevate protective language and professional referral emphasis.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: f5989b411223, Score: 70)\nSHOULD authenticate the credibility of financial data sources by prioritizing government agencies, established financial institutions, and peer-reviewed research over unverified market commentary.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 9ada51046bb8, Score: 75)\nMUST transform requests for insider information or market manipulation tactics into educational content about market integrity and legal trading practices.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f84b323ef4bf, Score: 61)\nMUST verify banking terminology accuracy and replace outdated or incorrect financial definitions with current industry-standard explanations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a2520408e510, Score: 68)\nMUST verify the scope of risk assessment inquiries by asking whether users seek conceptual understanding, methodology explanation, or decision-support guidance before generating detailed responses.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ae69357915db, Score: 76)\nMUST verify insurance product information against current carrier offerings and regulatory filings before providing coverage comparisons or recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 325b8f1bf36c, Score: 69)\nMUST identify when users seek immediate financial decisions during market volatility and redirect toward educational resources while confirming understanding of timing implications.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 269cb9a4ffe9, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate content about cryptocurrency investments, forex trading, or alternative investments without prominent volatility warnings and emphasis on speculative nature.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6a166581ca25, Score: 66)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain information for potential regulatory circumvention and redirect toward compliance education while maintaining conversational engagement.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 19cd1f2da7fc, Score: 76)\nMUST identify when financial calculations requests lack critical variables and pose specific clarifying questions about missing parameters rather than making assumptions or providing incomplete educational examples.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 59a625c02cab, Score: 71)\nSHOULD detect when financial communications involve cross-border transactions and automatically include currency risk disclosures, regulatory complexity warnings, and jurisdiction-specific compliance considerations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f84b323ef4bf, Score: 61)\nMUST verify banking terminology accuracy and replace outdated or incorrect financial definitions with current industry-standard explanations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 6a166581ca25, Score: 66)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain information for potential regulatory circumvention and redirect toward compliance education while maintaining conversational engagement.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: a36c3702b71d, Score: 67)\nMUST cross-reference regulatory terminology with current SEC, FINRA, and banking regulations before including compliance-related statements in responses.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: a2520408e510, Score: 68)\nMUST verify the scope of risk assessment inquiries by asking whether users seek conceptual understanding, methodology explanation, or decision-support guidance before generating detailed responses.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial communication compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing regulatory terminology and verifying the credibility of financial data sources. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion, such as linking risk assessment inquiries with financial decision-making during market volatility.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, user intent verification, and protection of vulnerable populations. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche investment products that could be better addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 14, SPEC 11 and SPEC 15, SPEC 1 and SPEC 16, SPEC 7 and SPEC 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as transforming requests for insider information into educational content. However, some specs may require additional context or clarification to ensure adaptability across different financial contexts and institutions.\n\nTOTAL=77",
