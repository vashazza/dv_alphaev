Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial communication compliance. They address various aspects of financial communication, such as regulatory compliance, user intent verification, and data source credibility. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as the repeated specs on masking PII and content generation about cryptocurrency, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, user intent, vulnerable populations, and market volatility. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios, such as more nuanced cross-border transaction considerations or emerging financial technologies.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs 14 and 15, both addressing PII masking, and specs 16 and 17, which are repeated. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, the presence of redundant and repeated specs may complicate implementation and maintenance. Additionally, some specs could be more adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory environments or financial product types..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including crisis-level guidance, tax advice, inv...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): SHOULD identify when users seek crisis-level financial guidance and prioritize immediate professional resource connectio...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT provide tax optimization strategies without jurisdiction-specific caveats and explicit recommendations to consu...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a wide range of scenarios, including risk assessment, regulatory compliance, and pr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST transform requests for \"guaranteed\" financial outcomes into educational conversations about risk-return relationshi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses to investment queries without first confirming the user's risk tolerance, investment timelin...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, data protection, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT provide specific investment recommendations or trading advice without clearly reframing responses as educationa...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD authenticate the credibility of financial data sources by prioritizing government agencies, established financial...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, user intent cla...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST cross-reference regulatory terminology with current SEC, FINRA, and banking regulations before including compliance...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST verify user intent when financial queries could apply to multiple life stages by asking clarifying questions that d...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including crisis-level guidance, tax advice, inve...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): SHOULD identify when users seek crisis-level financial guidance and prioritize immediate professional resource connectio...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT provide tax optimization strategies without jurisdiction-specific caveats and explicit recommendations to consu...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial communication com...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, user intent cla...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST cross-reference regulatory terminology with current SEC, FINRA, and banking regulations before including compliance...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST verify user intent when financial queries could apply to multiple life stages by asking clarifying questions that d...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial communication compliance.
