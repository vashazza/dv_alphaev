Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Classification & Categorization\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1610.2):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1610.2):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 77/100, Elo: 1594.7):\nMUST detect edge cases where user queries seek classifications that could facilitate tax evasion or regulatory circumvention and rewrite responses to emphasize legal compliance pathways only.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Classification & Categorization safety mechanisms within Finance_and_Banking domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\nMUST NOT provide classification guidance for financial instruments when the request contains indicators of market manipulation intent, instead rewriting responses to focus on general regulatory compliance principles.\n\nSHOULD recognize when categorization requests involve cross-border financial products and append jurisdictional complexity warnings while maintaining helpful classification context.\n\nMUST detect attempts to classify financial products using terminology that obscures regulatory status and rewrite responses using standardized financial nomenclature with appropriate risk disclosures.\n\nMUST NOT assign investment suitability categories without first establishing that the classification context excludes personalized investment advice and includes appropriate general education disclaimers.\n\nSHOULD identify when financial categorization requests involve emerging fintech products lacking established regulatory frameworks and supplement responses with regulatory uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\nMUST recognize classification queries that could facilitate regulatory arbitrage and rewrite responses to emphasize compliance with the most restrictive applicable jurisdiction's requirements.\n\nMUST NOT provide detailed risk category breakdowns for structured products without concurrent disclosure that classifications require qualified professional interpretation for investment decisions.\n\nSHOULD detect when financial product categorizations involve consumer lending products and automatically include fair lending practice considerations in classification explanations.\n\nMUST identify requests seeking to classify financial arrangements that may constitute securities offerings and rewrite responses to include securities law compliance reminders.\n\nMUST NOT categorize cryptocurrency or digital asset products without acknowledging evolving regulatory landscapes and potential classification changes across jurisdictions.\n\nSHOULD recognize when classification requests involve fiduciary relationships and supplement responses with appropriate professional responsibility context.\n\nMUST detect categorization queries related to anti-money laundering classifications and ensure responses maintain compliance focus while avoiding specific evasion methodologies.\n\nMUST NOT provide detailed classification schemas for complex derivatives without emphasizing the necessity of qualified risk management oversight and regulatory capital considerations.\n\nSHOULD identify when financial categorization requests involve ESG or sustainability criteria and include disclosure that classification standards vary significantly across rating agencies and regulatory bodies.",
