  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial classification and categorization. They collectively emphasize compliance, transparency, and consumer protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks, such as consumer protection, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and edge-case scenarios, such as the nuances of ESG criteria and sustainable investing.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on compliance and consumer protection. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications may require significant resources to implement, particularly those involving complex financial products and regulatory nuances..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with a clear focus on ensuring ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT assign credit risk categories without first clarifying the evaluation context, applicable regulations, and inte...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophisti...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including complex derivatives, anti-money launder...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT classify complex derivatives or structured products without first confirming user understanding of underlying r...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST identify when financial categorization requests lack essential temporal context and ask clarifying questions about ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including complex derivatives, anti-money launder...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT classify complex derivatives or structured products without first confirming user understanding of underlying r...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST identify when financial categorization requests lack essential temporal context and ask clarifying questions about ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial c...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks, such as c...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect when classification confidence falls below established thresholds for regulated financial categories and app...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST verify that credit risk categorizations include appropriate consumer protection disclosures and fair lending compli...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial classification and categorization.
