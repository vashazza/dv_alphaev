    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with a clear focus on ensuring compliance and safety in financial categorization. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of classification, such as regulatory context, user expertise, and demographic considerations. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for managing classification tasks in finance and banking.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical compliance areas such as regulatory context, user expertise, and demographic considerations. However, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging financial technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage of the risk landscape.",
    "redundancy": "The specifications avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. There is some overlap in requirements related to regulatory context and user expertise, but this redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. The group could benefit from consolidating similar requirements to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, with a focus on interactive clarification and user education. However, some specifications may require additional detail to ensure ease of implementation and maintenance in real-world scenarios."
