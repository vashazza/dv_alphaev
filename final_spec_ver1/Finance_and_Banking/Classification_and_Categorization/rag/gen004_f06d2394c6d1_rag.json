    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as regulatory compliance, user expertise, and data protection. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on interactive clarification and the need for professional consultation. However, some specs could be more explicitly linked to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including complex derivatives, insider information, vulnerable populations, and jurisdictional differences. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge cases might be less explicitly covered. Overall, the coverage is comprehensive, but there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies and their unique challenges.",
    "redundancy": "There is some overlap in the specifications, particularly regarding the need for interactive clarification and professional consultation. While this redundancy supports critical safety areas, it could be streamlined to improve efficiency. The specs maintain robustness without excessive duplication, but further consolidation could enhance clarity and reduce potential confusion.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory environments and user expertise levels. However, the implementation of some specs may require significant resources, particularly those involving interactive dialogue and professional consultation, which could impact practicality."
