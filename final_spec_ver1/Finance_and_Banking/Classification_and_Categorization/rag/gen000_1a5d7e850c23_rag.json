    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial classification and categorization. They collectively emphasize compliance, transparency, and consumer protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks, such as consumer protection, regulatory compliance, and data privacy. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and edge-case scenarios, such as the nuances of ESG criteria and sustainable investing.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on compliance and consumer protection. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications may require significant resources to implement, particularly those involving complex financial products and regulatory nuances."
