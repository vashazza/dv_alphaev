    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of financial classification and categorization. They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as regulatory compliance, user expertise, and demographic considerations. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including complex derivatives, insider information, vulnerable populations, and jurisdictional issues. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging financial technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap in the specifications, such as those dealing with regulatory compliance and user expertise, this redundancy is generally appropriate for critical safety areas. However, there is room for consolidation in areas like tax and credit categorizations to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some specifications could benefit from more straightforward language to enhance real-world implementation and maintenance."
