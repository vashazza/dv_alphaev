    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of financial classification and categorization, such as regulatory compliance, user expertise, and data protection. The specs complement each other by covering different scenarios and ensuring that classifications are made responsibly and ethically. However, there could be more explicit connections between some specs to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including complex derivatives, insider information, vulnerable populations, and jurisdictional differences. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there may be some edge cases or emerging financial technologies that are not fully covered. Overall, the coverage is comprehensive but could be improved with more focus on rapidly evolving financial products.",
    "redundancy": "There is some overlap in the specifications, particularly regarding the need for interactive clarification and user education. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to reduce duplication. The balance between redundancy and efficiency is mostly maintained, but there is room for optimization.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, such as varying regulatory environments and user expertise levels. However, the implementation of some specs may require significant resources, and there could be challenges in maintaining them as financial regulations and technologies evolve."
