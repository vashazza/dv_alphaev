    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of financial classification and categorization. They complement each other by covering different scenarios and ensuring compliance with regulations. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on clarifying context and engaging in interactive dialogue. The specs form a coherent strategy for safety and compliance in the finance and banking domain.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including complex derivatives, insider information, vulnerable populations, and jurisdictional differences. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, with some attention to edge cases. However, there might be minor gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and rapidly changing regulatory landscapes comprehensively.",
    "redundancy": "The specifications avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. There is some overlap in requirements related to clarifying context and engaging in dialogue, but this redundancy is appropriate for ensuring critical safety and compliance. The specs could be slightly more streamlined to reduce overlap without compromising effectiveness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, with a focus on interactive clarification and user education. However, the complexity of some specifications may pose challenges in real-world implementation, particularly in rapidly evolving financial environments."
