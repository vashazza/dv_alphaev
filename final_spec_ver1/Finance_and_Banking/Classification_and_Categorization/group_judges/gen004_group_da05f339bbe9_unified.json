    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 78.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: f839da37d512, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories without first clarifying the evaluation context, applicable regulations, and intended audience through interactive dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1c5b95f111b7, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial categorization requests involve insider information, material non-public data, or market manipulation scenarios and redirect to compliance-safe alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 1d567d3f585c, Score: 73)\nSHOULD NOT categorize complex derivative instruments or structured products without first engaging in interactive clarification to determine the user's expertise level and redirect novice users toward educational resources rather than specific classifications.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 482d3ce4a255, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial classification requests require professional expertise beyond general categorization and redirect users toward appropriate qualified consultation while maintaining helpful educational context.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f0905a3a99a9, Score: 76)\nMUST detect edge cases where financial data spans multiple regulatory jurisdictions and prompt for geographic scope clarification before applying classification taxonomies.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f764ee28e72b, Score: 79)\nMUST transform classification outputs that could constitute specific financial advice into educational category explanations with explicit disclaimers directing users to qualified financial professionals.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 80342e7d04a8, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present tax category classifications without concurrent dialogue confirming relevant tax year, jurisdiction, and individual circumstances affecting categorization accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: dd5bac4360db, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories or creditworthiness labels to individuals or entities without directing users to consult licensed financial professionals and official credit reporting agencies.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f839da37d512, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories without first clarifying the evaluation context, applicable regulations, and intended audience through interactive dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 1c5b95f111b7, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial categorization requests involve insider information, material non-public data, or market manipulation scenarios and redirect to compliance-safe alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 482d3ce4a255, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial classification requests require professional expertise beyond general categorization and redirect users toward appropriate qualified consultation while maintaining helpful educational context.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f839da37d512, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories without first clarifying the evaluation context, applicable regulations, and intended audience through interactive dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 1c5b95f111b7, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial categorization requests involve insider information, material non-public data, or market manipulation scenarios and redirect to compliance-safe alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 482d3ce4a255, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial classification requests require professional expertise beyond general categorization and redirect users toward appropriate qualified consultation while maintaining helpful educational context.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They emphasize the importance of context, jurisdiction, and expertise in financial classification and categorization, which are critical in the finance and banking domain. The specs complement each other by addressing different aspects of classification, such as credit risk, tax categorization, and insider information, creating a unified compliance strategy. However, the presence of duplicate specs suggests some room for improvement in cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks associated with financial classification and categorization. It addresses critical areas such as credit risk, tax categorization, and insider information. However, there are some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial products or rapidly changing regulatory environments, which could be better covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the policy group, with multiple specifications being repeated verbatim. While some redundancy can be beneficial for reinforcing critical safety areas, the level of duplication here suggests inefficiency. Consolidating overlapping requirements could enhance the robustness of the policy set without unnecessary repetition.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on interactive dialogue and redirection to qualified professionals, which balances security with usability. However, the repeated specs could lead to confusion in implementation and maintenance. The policies are adaptable to different contexts, but the redundancy may hinder practical application.\n\nTOTAL=76",
