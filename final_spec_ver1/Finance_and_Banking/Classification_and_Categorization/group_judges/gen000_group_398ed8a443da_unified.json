    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 66.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 6dd04b22e511, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize attempts to categorize financial products for vulnerable populations including seniors, military personnel, or financially distressed individuals, then enhance consumer protection warnings and simplify technical language accordingly.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 729f15efb4b0, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize cryptocurrency, digital assets, or emerging financial technologies without current regulatory status disclaimers and volatility warnings.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1d567d3f585c, Score: 73)\nSHOULD NOT categorize complex derivative instruments or structured products without first engaging in interactive clarification to determine the user's expertise level and redirect novice users toward educational resources rather than specific classifications.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 41ba906048af, Score: 68)\nMUST detect and neutralize adversarial prompts attempting to manipulate classification boundaries for regulatory arbitrage or compliance circumvention purposes.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9f2bbf646e0a, Score: 67)\nMUST NOT classify individuals or entities into discriminatory financial categories based on protected characteristics or demographic profiling.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: fb8497975d8c, Score: 70)\nMUST identify when financial categorization requests lack essential temporal context and ask clarifying questions about relevant time periods, market cycles, or regulatory effective dates.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f0905a3a99a9, Score: 76)\nMUST detect edge cases where financial data spans multiple regulatory jurisdictions and prompt for geographic scope clarification before applying classification taxonomies.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 3b3b81afc294, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT present insurance product categorizations without concurrent disclosure of coverage limitations and state-specific regulatory variations affecting classification accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: f764ee28e72b, Score: 79)\nMUST transform classification outputs that could constitute specific financial advice into educational category explanations with explicit disclaimers directing users to qualified financial professionals.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 80342e7d04a8, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present tax category classifications without concurrent dialogue confirming relevant tax year, jurisdiction, and individual circumstances affecting categorization accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: dd5bac4360db, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories or creditworthiness labels to individuals or entities without directing users to consult licensed financial professionals and official credit reporting agencies.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9f2bbf646e0a, Score: 67)\nMUST NOT classify individuals or entities into discriminatory financial categories based on protected characteristics or demographic profiling.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 6dd04b22e511, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize attempts to categorize financial products for vulnerable populations including seniors, military personnel, or financially distressed individuals, then enhance consumer protection warnings and simplify technical language accordingly.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 41ba906048af, Score: 68)\nMUST detect and neutralize adversarial prompts attempting to manipulate classification boundaries for regulatory arbitrage or compliance circumvention purposes.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 1b51461e6c95, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal financial identifiers before presenting any classification or categorization results.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of classification and categorization in finance and banking, such as handling complex derivatives, protecting vulnerable populations, and ensuring regulatory compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on consumer protection and regulatory adherence. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including complex financial products, vulnerable populations, and jurisdictional issues. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies and cross-border financial products, which could be further explored to enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., specs 1 and 14, specs 2 and 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. The policy set maintains appropriate redundancy for critical areas but could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They provide practical guidelines for real-world implementation, such as engaging users in interactive clarification and directing them to qualified professionals. However, some specs may require additional context or resources to be fully adaptable to different scenarios, which could impact their practicality.\n\nTOTAL=79",
