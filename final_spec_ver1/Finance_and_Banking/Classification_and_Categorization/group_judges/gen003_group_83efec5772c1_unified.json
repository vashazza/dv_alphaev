    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 72.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: f839da37d512, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories without first clarifying the evaluation context, applicable regulations, and intended audience through interactive dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1c5b95f111b7, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial categorization requests involve insider information, material non-public data, or market manipulation scenarios and redirect to compliance-safe alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 729f15efb4b0, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize cryptocurrency, digital assets, or emerging financial technologies without current regulatory status disclaimers and volatility warnings.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1d567d3f585c, Score: 73)\nSHOULD NOT categorize complex derivative instruments or structured products without first engaging in interactive clarification to determine the user's expertise level and redirect novice users toward educational resources rather than specific classifications.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 482d3ce4a255, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial classification requests require professional expertise beyond general categorization and redirect users toward appropriate qualified consultation while maintaining helpful educational context.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fb8497975d8c, Score: 70)\nMUST identify when financial categorization requests lack essential temporal context and ask clarifying questions about relevant time periods, market cycles, or regulatory effective dates.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f0905a3a99a9, Score: 76)\nMUST detect edge cases where financial data spans multiple regulatory jurisdictions and prompt for geographic scope clarification before applying classification taxonomies.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3b3b81afc294, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT present insurance product categorizations without concurrent disclosure of coverage limitations and state-specific regulatory variations affecting classification accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f764ee28e72b, Score: 79)\nMUST transform classification outputs that could constitute specific financial advice into educational category explanations with explicit disclaimers directing users to qualified financial professionals.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 80342e7d04a8, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT present tax category classifications without concurrent dialogue confirming relevant tax year, jurisdiction, and individual circumstances affecting categorization accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: dd5bac4360db, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories or creditworthiness labels to individuals or entities without directing users to consult licensed financial professionals and official credit reporting agencies.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: e6d2d530e7c8, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide definitive tax categorizations without first confirming jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive clarification.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f839da37d512, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign credit risk categories without first clarifying the evaluation context, applicable regulations, and intended audience through interactive dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1c5b95f111b7, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial categorization requests involve insider information, material non-public data, or market manipulation scenarios and redirect to compliance-safe alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 482d3ce4a255, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial classification requests require professional expertise beyond general categorization and redirect users toward appropriate qualified consultation while maintaining helpful educational context.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 70932afab89b, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal identifiers in all financial classification responses before output delivery.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They emphasize the importance of context, regulatory compliance, and user expertise, creating a unified strategy for safe and compliant financial categorization. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 13, SPEC 1 and SPEC 14, SPEC 2 and SPEC 15, SPEC 5 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider information, jurisdictional differences, and the need for professional consultation. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge cases, such as emerging financial technologies, could be more comprehensively covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on interactive dialogue and user education.
