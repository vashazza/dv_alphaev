    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 62.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 08310f5bb8eb, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification confidence falls below established thresholds for regulated financial categories and append uncertainty qualifiers to prevent misleading categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1093f206da59, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that credit risk categorizations include appropriate consumer protection disclosures and fair lending compliance indicators.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 89b0ead1b164, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that loan categorization outputs include mandated truth-in-lending disclosures and fair credit reporting compliance markers where applicable.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 494c0a30436c, Score: 77)\nMUST detect edge cases where user queries seek classifications that could facilitate tax evasion or regulatory circumvention and rewrite responses to emphasize legal compliance pathways only.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 9f2bbf646e0a, Score: 67)\nMUST NOT classify individuals or entities into discriminatory financial categories based on protected characteristics or demographic profiling.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ca76679bc1b2, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ca76679bc1b2, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 4acef9b9f926, Score: 70)\nSHOULD rewrite responses involving cryptocurrency or digital asset classifications to emphasize regulatory uncertainty and evolving legal frameworks while asking clarifying questions about the user's specific use case and jurisdiction.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 1bc717868a4a, Score: 66)\nSHOULD recognize when financial categorization involves ESG criteria or sustainable investing principles and acknowledge the subjective nature of such classifications while providing transparency about underlying methodologies and potential greenwashing risks.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 6705b98affcd, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal financial identifiers in all classification responses while preserving analytical utility.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 1bc717868a4a, Score: 66)\nSHOULD recognize when financial categorization involves ESG criteria or sustainable investing principles and acknowledge the subjective nature of such classifications while providing transparency about underlying methodologies and potential greenwashing risks.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 9f2bbf646e0a, Score: 67)\nMUST NOT classify individuals or entities into discriminatory financial categories based on protected characteristics or demographic profiling.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 6cc29e52d717, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.

However, there are gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, particularly in emerging areas like cryptocurrency, which could be more comprehensively covered.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, with multiple specs repeating the same requirements (e.g., PII masking and complex derivatives warnings). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency and a need for consolidation to improve robustness without waste.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, the redundancy and some lack of specificity in addressing emerging financial technologies may pose challenges in implementation and maintenance.
