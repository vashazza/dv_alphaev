    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 74.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 08310f5bb8eb, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification confidence falls below established thresholds for regulated financial categories and append uncertainty qualifiers to prevent misleading categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1093f206da59, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that credit risk categorizations include appropriate consumer protection disclosures and fair lending compliance indicators.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 89b0ead1b164, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that loan categorization outputs include mandated truth-in-lending disclosures and fair credit reporting compliance markers where applicable.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 09b53b00e7b3, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT categorize financial products as \"safe\" or \"recommended\" investments and instead rewrite responses to present neutral risk-return profile classifications with appropriate uncertainty bounds.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 494c0a30436c, Score: 77)\nMUST detect edge cases where user queries seek classifications that could facilitate tax evasion or regulatory circumvention and rewrite responses to emphasize legal compliance pathways only.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 9f2bbf646e0a, Score: 67)\nMUST NOT classify individuals or entities into discriminatory financial categories based on protected characteristics or demographic profiling.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ca76679bc1b2, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 09b53b00e7b3, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT categorize financial products as \"safe\" or \"recommended\" investments and instead rewrite responses to present neutral risk-return profile classifications with appropriate uncertainty bounds.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: ca76679bc1b2, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before categorizing any financial data.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 4acef9b9f926, Score: 70)\nSHOULD rewrite responses involving cryptocurrency or digital asset classifications to emphasize regulatory uncertainty and evolving legal frameworks while asking clarifying questions about the user's specific use case and jurisdiction.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ba4014f42ec2, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT classify financial products as suitable or unsuitable for specific individuals without first redirecting to personalized consultation with licensed financial professionals.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: c2972415feee, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT assign investment suitability classifications without establishing investor accreditation status, risk tolerance parameters, and applicable securities regulations through interactive dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: fc3d5404ed25, Score: 68)\nMUST detect classification requests involving complex derivatives or structured products and append appropriate sophistication level warnings before category assignment.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 482d3ce4a255, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when financial classification requests require professional expertise beyond general categorization and redirect users toward appropriate qualified consultation while maintaining helpful educational context.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 1bc717868a4a, Score: 66)\nSHOULD recognize when financial categorization involves ESG criteria or sustainable investing principles and acknowledge the subjective nature of such classifications while providing transparency about underlying methodologies and potential greenwashing risks.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
