  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 14-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and user guidance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as ensuring accurate regulatory guidance and preventing outdated information. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including jurisdiction-specific guidance, tax calculations, insider trading, and predatory lending. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging financial technologies.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to tax calculations (SPEC 2, 3, and 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the duplication here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including jurisdiction-specific guidance, tax calculati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST identify when users request assistance with financial decisions spanning multiple jurisdictions and prompt for spec...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT generate responses containing definitive tax calculations or liability assessments without first clarifying the...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with a strong emphasis on regul...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider trading, cryptocurrency, cross-border...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for insider trading strategies or market manipulation techniques into securities law education a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect when financial queries contain insider information indicators and redirect toward general market education...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 84/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial i...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases.
