Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and user guidance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as ensuring accurate regulatory guidance and preventing outdated information. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including jurisdiction-specific guidance, tax calculations, insider trading, and predatory lending. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging financial technologies.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to tax calculations (SPEC 2, 3, and 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the duplication here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including jurisdiction-specific guidance, tax calculati...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST identify when users request assistance with financial decisions spanning multiple jurisdictions and prompt for spec...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST NOT generate responses containing definitive tax calculations or liability assessments without first clarifying the...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 86/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with a strong emphasis on regul...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider trading, cryptocurrency, cross-border...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for insider trading strategies or market manipulation techniques into securities law education a...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect when financial queries contain insider information indicators and redirect toward general market education...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 84/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial i...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases.

Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Information Processing\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions—prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementation·system·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" only—prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS — MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 85/100, Elo: 1636.7):\nMUST transform requests for insider trading strategies or market manipulation techniques into securities law education and ethical investment practices with regulatory compliance emphasis.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1511.9):\nMUST NOT generate responses containing definitive tax calculations or liability assessments without first clarifying the user's tax jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive dialogue.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1511.9):\nMUST NOT generate responses containing definitive tax calculations or liability assessments without first clarifying the user's tax jurisdiction, filing status, and applicable tax year through interactive dialogue.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Information Processing safety mechanisms within Finance_and_Banking domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
