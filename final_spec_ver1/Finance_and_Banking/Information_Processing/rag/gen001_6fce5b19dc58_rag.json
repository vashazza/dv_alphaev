    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial information processing. They complement each other by covering different facets of compliance, such as regulatory adherence, user guidance, and ethical considerations. However, there are some minor overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group of specifications covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, user guidance, and ethical considerations. Primary and secondary scenarios are well-addressed, but there are some edge cases, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products, that could be better covered.",
    "redundancy": "There are a few instances of redundancy, such as the repetition of similar requirements in SPEC 4 and SPEC 13, and SPEC 10 and SPEC 15. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios, particularly those involving complex jurisdictional differences."
