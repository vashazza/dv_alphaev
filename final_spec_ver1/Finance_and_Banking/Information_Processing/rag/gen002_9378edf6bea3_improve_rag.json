    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes compliance, ethical practices, and risk management. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring data validation. However, some specs could be more explicitly linked to enhance cohesion further.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax evasion, credit repair, bankruptcy, market predictions, retirement planning, international banking, and cryptocurrency. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge cases, such as emerging financial technologies, could be better covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 9, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming unethical requests into compliant actions. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs may require additional clarity or resources to implement effectively in real-world scenarios."
