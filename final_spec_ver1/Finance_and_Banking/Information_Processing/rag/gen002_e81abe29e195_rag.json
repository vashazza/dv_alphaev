    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure compliance and ethical behavior in financial interactions, with logical connections between requirements such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring accurate financial data usage. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax evasion, credit manipulation, bankruptcy, and international banking compliance. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though some edge cases, such as emerging financial technologies, could be better addressed to enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 10, SPEC 8 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming unethical requests into compliant actions. They balance security with usability, though some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse financial contexts. Greater adaptability could enhance practicality."
