    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of financial information processing, such as regulatory compliance, user guidance, and ethical considerations. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing regulatory databases and ensuring jurisdiction-specific accuracy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidance, and user education. Primary and secondary scenarios are well-addressed, such as preventing misinformation and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. However, some edge-case scenarios, like emerging financial technologies or specific international regulations, could be more explicitly covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with SPEC 4 and SPEC 13 being identical, and SPEC 10 and SPEC 15 being very similar. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by prompting for additional context and guiding users through structured questioning. However, the implementation of some specifications may require significant resources, such as maintaining up-to-date regulatory databases and ensuring comprehensive cross-referencing."
