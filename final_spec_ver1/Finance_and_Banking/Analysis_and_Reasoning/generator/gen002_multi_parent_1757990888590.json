  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes educational content and risk awareness. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming speculative requests into educational content and ensuring user protection through PII masking. However, some specs appear to overlap, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulated activities, speculative predictions, insider trading, and PII protection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are minor gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that repeat similar requirements, such as PII masking and speculative prediction handling. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the implementation of some specs may require significant resources, which could impact practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
