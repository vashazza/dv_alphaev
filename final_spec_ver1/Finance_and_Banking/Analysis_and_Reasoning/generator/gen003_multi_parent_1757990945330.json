Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes educational redirection and risk awareness. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming speculative requests into educational content and ensuring user protection through PII masking. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which could indicate a lack of unique integration.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative predictions, insider trading, and PII protection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche market activities..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming speculative requests into educational content and ensuring user protection through PII masking. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which could indicate a lack of unique integration.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative predictions, insider trading, and PII protection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche market activities.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 1, 9, and 19; Specs 4 and 10; Specs 7 and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming risky requests into educational content and ensuring user protection. However, the implementation might be challenging due to the need for constant updates in response to evolving financial regulations and technologies. The balance between security and usability is maintained, but adaptability could be improved.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 70) MUST NOT generate responses to requests for cryptocurrency investment timing or altcoin speculation ...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST NOT generate investment recommendations or portfolio allocation advice without first transformi...\n  - [3] (Score: 70) MUST NOT provide debt restructuring advice without transforming responses into educational content a...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
