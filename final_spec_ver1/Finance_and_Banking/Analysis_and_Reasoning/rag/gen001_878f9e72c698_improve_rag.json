    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes risk awareness, educational content, and professional guidance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the focus on transforming speculative or potentially misleading content into educational material. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative market predictions, ambiguous terminology, PII protection, and reasoning fallacies. It addresses primary and secondary scenarios effectively, but there are some gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or specific regulatory changes.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 2, SPEC 5 and SPEC 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on educational content and professional guidance. They balance security with usability, but the repeated specs and some complex requirements may pose challenges in real-world implementation and maintenance."
