    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize the importance of transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content, ensuring compliance with regulations, and protecting sensitive information. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulated activities, speculative predictions, insider trading, and PII protection. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively but could improve on edge-case scenarios and emerging financial technologies like cryptocurrency.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications related to masking PII and speculative market predictions. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on transforming risky requests into educational content. However, some requirements might be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, and the balance between security and usability could be better optimized."
