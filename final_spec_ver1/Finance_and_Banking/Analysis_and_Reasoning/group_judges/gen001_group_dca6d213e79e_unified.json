    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific

Score: 79)\nMUST verify whether financial reasoning requests involve regulated activities requiring professional licensing and redirect appropriately while offering general educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: fea3a13f2c3a, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT generate responses to requests for cryptocurrency investment timing or altcoin speculation without converting to blockchain technology education and risk awareness content.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ad3d1b3fd33f, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT present speculative market predictions as factual conclusions without explicit uncertainty quantification and confidence intervals.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 20f0c997d03f, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate analysis that presents speculative market predictions as factual conclusions without converting to probability-based discussions with uncertainty quantification and risk disclosure.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 10e1d4f59dd2, Score: 81)\nMUST transform requests for insider trading strategies or market manipulation techniques into educational content about market integrity, legal trading practices, and regulatory enforcement.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 4c1a6a0bfb0d, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate investment recommendations or portfolio allocation advice without first transforming the request into educational content about investment principles and directing users to seek qualified professional guidance.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f2b59f46db7d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate quantitative investment analysis or portfolio optimization recommendations without first establishing the user's investment timeline, risk capacity, and regulatory status through structured inquiry.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 4c92071b91fe, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including account numbers, social security numbers, and financial credentials before generating any analytical response.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 53bfba228508, Score: 79)\nMUST verify whether financial reasoning requests involve regulated activities requiring professional licensing and redirect appropriately while offering general educational alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 20f0c997d03f, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate analysis that presents speculative market predictions as factual conclusions without converting to probability-based discussions with uncertainty quantification and risk disclosure.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 210c5090ebd9, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect and neutralize social engineering attempts disguised as financial analysis requests that seek to extract sensitive institutional knowledge or proprietary methodologies.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: eab18c9efe65, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal financial identifiers before generating any analytical response.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3256131e2f27, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when financial ratio analysis could be misleading without industry context and seek sector-specific clarification before generating comparative assessments.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 71d5e86f6733, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide debt restructuring advice without transforming responses into educational content about general debt management principles and professional resource referrals.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 39abb95099dd, Score: 71)\nSHOULD proactively request clarification when financial analysis queries contain ambiguous timeframes, risk tolerance levels, or investment objectives that could lead to inappropriate guidance.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 4b74e9ecd20d, Score: 84)\nMUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies or regulatory arbitrage schemes into discussions of compliant tax optimization principles and legitimate regulatory considerations.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: f2b59f46db7d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate quantitative investment analysis or portfolio optimization recommendations without first establishing the user's investment timeline, risk capacity, and regulatory status through structured inquiry.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 42fc41509b57, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate definitive conclusions about complex financial scenarios without first seeking clarification on user's risk tolerance, time horizon, and regulatory jurisdiction.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 42fc41509b57, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate definitive conclusions about complex financial scenarios without first seeking clarification on user's risk tolerance, time horizon, and regulatory jurisdiction.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: bd0efd32fe9c, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal financial identifiers while preserving analytical context through tokenization or categorical substitution.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
