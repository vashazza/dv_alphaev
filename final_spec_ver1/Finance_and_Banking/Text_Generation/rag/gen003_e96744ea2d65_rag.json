    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and safety. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming misleading content into educational material and verifying regulatory compliance. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, cryptocurrency, predatory lending, and credit-related content. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification (ID: 712389ad9d28) appearing three times. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, this repetition does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user safety. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, such as ensuring up-to-date regulatory compliance in rapidly changing financial environments."
