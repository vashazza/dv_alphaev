    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial and banking text generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial advice, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in the areas of financial projections and credit-related content, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, cryptocurrency, predatory lending, and tax compliance. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products, which could be explored further.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to financial projections and credit content. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 8, and 12) suggests inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating these into a single, comprehensive specification.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and consumer protection. They balance security with usability, but the presence of redundant specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these could enhance practicality and adaptability across different contexts."
