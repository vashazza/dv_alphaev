    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and safety. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming misleading content into educational material and verifying regulatory compliance. However, some specs could be better integrated, particularly those dealing with similar topics like cryptocurrency and consumer protection.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, tax strategies, and consumer protection. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products that might not be fully covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6, 8, and 12) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical areas like consumer protection, the repetition of similar requirements suggests room for streamlining without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, the implementation might be challenging due to the need for constant updates to align with evolving regulations. The specs are adaptable but could benefit from more explicit guidance on maintaining compliance over time."
