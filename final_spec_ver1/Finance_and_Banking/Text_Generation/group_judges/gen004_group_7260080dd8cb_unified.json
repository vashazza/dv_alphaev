    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 14 specs, Avg Score: 72.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 98e4d106dac6, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate tax advice content without cross-referencing current IRS publications and qualifying all statements with tax year specificity and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: df6970c6fdb7, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate estate planning content that could constitute legal advice, instead providing general wealth transfer education with attorney consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a2e3accd6e7f, Score: 72)\nSHOULD detect when financial text generation requests contain emotional distress indicators related to debt or financial hardship and prioritize supportive educational content over transactional advice.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d5b2b12f7772, Score: 84)\nMUST transform requests for insider trading strategies or material non-public information exploitation into securities law education and ethical trading practice guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1d9f0b7876cb, Score: 74)\nMUST seek clarification on user licensing status and intended audience when requests involve generation of investment recommendations, tax strategies, or fiduciary communications that could constitute regulated financial advice.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fc48d546d5f2, Score: 83)\nMUST transform requests for tax evasion schemes or unreported income strategies into tax compliance education and voluntary disclosure program information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1dd3e5419895, Score: 74)\nMUST cross-reference generated financial calculations against multiple authoritative sources when producing loan amortization schedules, compound interest projections, or retirement planning scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3978e19bf2b3, Score: 77)\nSHOULD recognize prompts seeking to generate fake financial statements or accounting manipulation techniques and respond with accounting ethics education and proper financial reporting standards.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f060281bba77, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate financial projections or forecasting content without cross-validating against multiple authoritative economic data sources and including uncertainty ranges.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c6b36bce598d, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal financial identifiers while preserving the educational value of financial content.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 98e4d106dac6, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate tax advice content without cross-referencing current IRS publications and qualifying all statements with tax year specificity and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 01dbd4a6caac, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT produce cryptocurrency tax evasion strategies, instead generating compliant digital asset reporting guidance aligned with current Treasury Department guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 6e508f3bae5d, Score: 81)\nMUST verify credit-related content against current consumer protection regulations before generating loan terms, credit advice, or debt management guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 6e508f3bae5d, Score: 81)\nMUST verify credit-related content against current consumer protection regulations before generating loan terms, credit advice, or debt management guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
