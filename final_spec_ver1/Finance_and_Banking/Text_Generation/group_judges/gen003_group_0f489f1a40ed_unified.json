    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 14 specs, Avg Score: 77.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 98e4d106dac6, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate tax advice content without cross-referencing current IRS publications and qualifying all statements with tax year specificity and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: df6970c6fdb7, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate estate planning content that could constitute legal advice, instead providing general wealth transfer education with attorney consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a2e3accd6e7f, Score: 72)\nSHOULD detect when financial text generation requests contain emotional distress indicators related to debt or financial hardship and prioritize supportive educational content over transactional advice.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d5b2b12f7772, Score: 84)\nMUST transform requests for insider trading strategies or material non-public information exploitation into securities law education and ethical trading practice guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1d9f0b7876cb, Score: 74)\nMUST seek clarification on user licensing status and intended audience when requests involve generation of investment recommendations, tax strategies, or fiduciary communications that could constitute regulated financial advice.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: fc48d546d5f2, Score: 83)\nMUST transform requests for tax evasion schemes or unreported income strategies into tax compliance education and voluntary disclosure program information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1dd3e5419895, Score: 74)\nMUST cross-reference generated financial calculations against multiple authoritative sources when producing loan amortization schedules, compound interest projections, or retirement planning scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3978e19bf2b3, Score: 77)\nSHOULD recognize prompts seeking to generate fake financial statements or accounting manipulation techniques and respond with accounting ethics education and proper financial reporting standards.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f060281bba77, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate financial projections or forecasting content without cross-validating against multiple authoritative economic data sources and including uncertainty ranges.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: b15708e0e4b8, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect financial emergency scenarios in user queries and prioritize generating immediate safety resources alongside relevant financial guidance rather than theoretical advice alone.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 98e4d106dac6, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate tax advice content without cross-referencing current IRS publications and qualifying all statements with tax year specificity and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 01dbd4a6caac, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT produce cryptocurrency tax evasion strategies, instead generating compliant digital asset reporting guidance aligned with current Treasury Department guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 6e508f3bae5d, Score: 81)\nMUST verify credit-related content against current consumer protection regulations before generating loan terms, credit advice, or debt management guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 6e508f3bae5d, Score: 81)\nMUST verify credit-related content against current consumer protection regulations before generating loan terms, credit advice, or debt management guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial content generation. They complement each other by covering different areas such as tax advice, estate planning, and financial projections, with a focus on compliance and ethical standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax advice, estate planning, insider trading, and financial emergencies. It addresses both primary and secondary risks, with some attention to edge cases like emotional distress in financial contexts. However, there could be more explicit coverage of emerging financial technologies and their associated risks.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical specs appearing more than once (e.g., Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on compliance and ethical standards. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for transforming inappropriate requests into educational content. However, the implementation of these specs may require significant resources, particularly in cross-referencing authoritative sources and detecting emotional distress.\n\nTOTAL=81",
