Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and safety. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming misleading content into educational material and verifying regulatory compliance. However, some specs could be better integrated, particularly those dealing with similar topics like cryptocurrency and consumer protection.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, tax strategies, and consumer protection. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products that might not be fully covered.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6, 8, and 12) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical areas like consumer protection, the repetition of similar requirements suggests room for streamlining without losing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, the implementation might be challenging due to the need for constant updates to align with evolving regulations. The specs are adaptable but could benefit from more explicit guidance on maintaining compliance over time..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax advice, insider trading, money lau...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT generate tax advice content without cross-referencing current IRS publications and qualifying all statements wi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies or unreported income guidance into legitimate tax optimization educat...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bankruptcy, tax evasion, cryptocurrenc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax advice, insider trading, money lau...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT generate tax advice content without cross-referencing current IRS publications and qualifying all statements wi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies or unreported income guidance into legitimate tax optimization educat...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bankruptcy, tax evasion, cryptocurrenc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, cryptocurrency, pre...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST seek clarification on user licensing status and intended audience when requests involve generation of investment re...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite cryptocurrency-related queries into educational frameworks that first clarify regulatory jurisdiction, inve...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios relevant to the finance and banking domain, including ba...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and safety.
