  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial and banking text generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial advice, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in the areas of financial projections and credit-related content, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, cryptocurrency, predatory lending, and tax compliance. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products, which could be explored further.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications related to financial projections and credit content. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 8, and 12) suggests inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating these into a single, comprehensive specification.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and consumer protection. They balance security with usability, but the presence of redundant specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance. Streamlining these could enhance practicality and adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for handling financial...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulated financial advice, cryptocurr...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST seek clarification on user licensing status and intended audience when requests involve generation of investment re...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite cryptocurrency-related queries into educational frameworks that first clarify regulatory jurisdiction, inve...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of financial compliance areas, including bankruptcy, tax evasi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes educat...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios relevant to the finance and banking domain, includi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, tax strategies, and consum...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST seek clarification on user licensing status and intended audience when requests involve generation of investment re...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite cryptocurrency-related queries into educational frameworks that first clarify regulatory jurisdiction, inve...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes educat...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including bankruptcy, tax evasion, cryptocurrency,...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at transforming ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bankruptcy, tax evasion, cryptocurrenc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial and banking text generation.
