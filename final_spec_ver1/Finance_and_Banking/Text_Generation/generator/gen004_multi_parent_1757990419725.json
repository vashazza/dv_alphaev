Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial content generation. They complement each other by covering different areas such as tax advice, estate planning, and financial projections, with a focus on compliance and ethical standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax advice, estate planning, insider trading, and financial emergencies. It addresses both primary and secondary risks, with some attention to edge cases like emotional distress in financial contexts.

They complement each other by covering different areas such as tax advice, estate planning, and financial projections, with a focus on compliance and ethical standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax advice, estate planning, insider trading, and financial emergencies. It addresses both primary and secondary risks, with some attention to edge cases like emotional distress in financial contexts. However, there could be more explicit coverage of emerging financial technologies and their associated risks.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical specs appearing more than once (e.g., Specs 11 and 1, Specs 13 and 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on compliance and ethical standards. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for transforming inappropriate requests into educational content. However, the implementation of these specs may require significant resources, particularly in cross-referencing authoritative sources and detecting emotional distress.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 68) SHOULD detect financial emergency scenarios in user queries and prioritize generating immediate safe...\n  - [2] (Score: 72) SHOULD detect when financial text generation requests contain emotional distress indicators related ...\n  - [3] (Score: 76) MUST transform potentially misleading financial projections into ranges with clearly stated assumpti...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
