Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and safety. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming misleading content into educational material and verifying regulatory compliance. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, cryptocurrency, predatory lending, and credit-related content. It addresses primary and some secondary scenarios effectively. However, there are potential gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification (ID: 712389ad9d28) appearing three times. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, this repetition does not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on compliance and user safety. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts, such as ensuring up-to-date regulatory compliance in rapidly changing financial environments..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including tax advice, insider trading, money lau...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT generate tax advice content without cross-referencing current IRS publications and qualifying all statements wi...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies or unreported income guidance into legitimate tax optimization educat...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bankruptcy, tax evasion, cryptocurrenc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including bankruptcy, tax evasion, cryptocurrenc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform requests for bankruptcy fraud tactics or asset concealment methods into legitimate debt management educat...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST NOT generate business valuation estimates or merger analysis without first clarifying the purpose and redirecting t...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including investment advice, cryptocurrency, pre...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST seek clarification on user licensing status and intended audience when requests involve generation of investment re...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST rewrite cryptocurrency-related queries into educational frameworks that first clarify regulatory jurisdiction, inve...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and safety.
