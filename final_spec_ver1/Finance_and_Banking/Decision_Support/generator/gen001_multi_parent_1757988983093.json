  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes caution and thoroughness in financial decision support. They collectively aim to prevent the provision of specific financial advice without proper context and validation, which is crucial in the finance and banking domain. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 4 and SPEC 15) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including retirement planning, real estate, cryptocurrency, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both primary and secondary risk areas effectively. However, there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche investment strategies, to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeating similar requirements (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 4 and SPEC 15, SPEC 10 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on embedding uncertainty and validating information. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for rewriting and redirecting advice. However, the implementation could be challenging due to the need for constant updates and validation against external databases and regulatory changes..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 85/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with clear logical connections ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases.
