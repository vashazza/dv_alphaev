  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial decision support. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as embedding uncertainty in financial projections and ensuring user circumstances are considered before providing specific recommendations. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including retirement planning, real estate investment, cryptocurrency, and vulnerable populations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging financial technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 2 and 3, Specs 4 and 15, Specs 7 and 9, Specs 10 and 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying user expertise levels and financial scenarios. However, the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes risk m...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including stock recommendations, retirement plan...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST rewrite responses containing specific stock picks, cryptocurrency recommendations, or derivative trading strategies...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate decision support for retirement planning scenarios without age-appropriate risk tolerance calibration ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including stock recommendations, retirement plan...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST rewrite responses containing specific stock picks, cryptocurrency recommendations, or derivative trading strategies...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate decision support for retirement planning scenarios without age-appropriate risk tolerance calibration ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary financial decisi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST automatically rewrite any content that could constitute fiduciary advice by converting specific recommendations int...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes cautio...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including retirement planning, real estate, cryp...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST automatically rewrite any content that could constitute fiduciary advice by converting specific recommendations int...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including retirement planning, loan recommendatio...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial d...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including retirement planning, tax compliance, insider ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate decision support for retirement planning scenarios without age-appropriate risk tolerance calibration ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST identify insufficient context in business financial queries and generate targeted questions about entity type, indu...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial decision support.
