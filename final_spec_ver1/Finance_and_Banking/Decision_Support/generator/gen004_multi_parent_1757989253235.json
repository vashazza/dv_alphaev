  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes risk management, compliance, and ethical financial guidance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial decision-making, such as risk factors, legal compliance, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including stock trading, retirement planning, tax strategies, and financial advice. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more focus on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products, to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on compliance and ethical guidance. They balance security with usability by providing educational content and redirecting users to professional advice when necessary. However, the implementation of these policies may require significant resources, particularly in detecting and rewriting responses in real-time..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including stock trading, retirement planning, ta...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST rewrite responses containing specific stock picks, cryptocurrency recommendations, or derivative trading strategies...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate decision support for retirement planning scenarios without age-appropriate risk tolerance calibration ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including stock recommendations, retirement plan...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST rewrite responses containing specific stock picks, cryptocurrency recommendations, or derivative trading strategies...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate decision support for retirement planning scenarios without age-appropriate risk tolerance calibration ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios in the finance and banking domain, including stock...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST rewrite responses containing specific stock picks, cryptocurrency recommendations, or derivative trading strategies...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT generate decision support for retirement planning scenarios without age-appropriate risk tolerance calibration ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on risk...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including financial projections, retirement plan...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including retirement planning, real estate investment, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST automatically rewrite any content that could constitute fiduciary advice by converting specific recommendations int...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including risk tolerance, regulatory compliance,...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT generate responses containing specific dollar amounts, percentage returns, or numerical projections for individ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST automatically rewrite any content that could constitute fiduciary advice by converting specific recommendations int...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes risk management, compliance, and ethical financial guidance.
