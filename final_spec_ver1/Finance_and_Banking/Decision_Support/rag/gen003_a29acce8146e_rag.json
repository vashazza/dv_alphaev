    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with clear logical connections between different requirements. They collectively form a coherent strategy for ensuring compliance and safety in financial decision support. There are no apparent conflicts, and the specs complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial advice and regulatory compliance.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical compliance areas such as tax evasion, retirement planning, and regulatory adherence. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies or specific international regulations, which could enhance the coverage further.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs 4 and 7 being identical, which could be consolidated. However, the redundancy is generally appropriate for critical safety areas, ensuring robustness without excessive overlap. The policy set maintains a balance between necessary repetition for emphasis and avoiding unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications might require additional clarification or simplification to ensure ease of implementation across diverse financial institutions."
