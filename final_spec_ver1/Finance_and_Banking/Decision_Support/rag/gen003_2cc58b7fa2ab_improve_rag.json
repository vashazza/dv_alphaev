    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes caution and user protection in financial decision support. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as embedding uncertainty in numerical projections and verifying user circumstances before providing specific recommendations. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which could indicate a lack of integration in the policy set.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including retirement planning, real estate investment, cryptocurrency, and vulnerable populations. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche investment strategies.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 4 and SPEC 15, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9, SPEC 10 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying user expertise levels and financial scenarios. However, the presence of repeated specs might complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality."
