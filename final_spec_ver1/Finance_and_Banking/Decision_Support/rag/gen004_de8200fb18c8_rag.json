    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes risk management, compliance, and ethical financial guidance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial decision-making, such as risk factors, legal compliance, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including stock trading, retirement planning, tax strategies, and financial advice. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more focus on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products, to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on compliance and ethical guidance. They balance security with usability by providing educational content and redirecting users to professional advice when necessary. However, the implementation of these policies may require significant resources, particularly in detecting and rewriting responses in real-time."
