    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial decision support. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as embedding uncertainty in financial projections and ensuring user circumstances are considered before providing specific recommendations. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including retirement planning, real estate investment, cryptocurrency, and vulnerable populations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging financial technologies to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 2 and 3, Specs 4 and 15, Specs 7 and 9, Specs 10 and 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying user expertise levels and financial scenarios. However, the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality."
