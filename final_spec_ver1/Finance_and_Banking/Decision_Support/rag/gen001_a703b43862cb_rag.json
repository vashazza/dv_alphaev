    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes risk management, compliance, and ethical financial advice. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as focusing on educational content and ensuring transparency in financial decision-making. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including stock recommendations, retirement planning, tax strategies, and insider trading. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on compliance and ethical considerations. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the presence of repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance."
