  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial code generation. They address various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, such as encryption, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like financial fraud, data encryption, and regulatory compliance, as well as secondary issues like cryptocurrency and high-frequency trading. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and edge-case scenarios, such as AI-driven financial analysis.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could be more detailed in terms of implementation guidance, particularly for complex scenarios like high-frequency trading and blockchain..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial c...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks such as comp...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT produce code for automated financial decision-making without explicit human oversight checkpoints and manual ap...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect requests for loan origination or credit scoring code and automatically append fair lending compliance checks...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks such as financial...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like encryption, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
