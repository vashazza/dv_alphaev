  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 83.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial code generation. They address various aspects of compliance, security, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between requirements. For example, multiple specs focus on compliance checks and educational redirection, which complement each other. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for even better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases in the finance and banking domain. It addresses critical areas such as compliance, security, and ethical considerations. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging technologies or niche financial products that could be explored further.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, such as repeated requirements for fair lending compliance checks and high-frequency trading education. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, the implementation of some specs might require significant resources, which could impact their practicality in real-world scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial c...\n💬 Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 84): MUST NOT produce code for automated financial decision-making without explicit human oversight checkpoints and manual ap...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect requests for loan origination or credit scoring code and automatically append fair lending compliance checks...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like financial fraud, data encr...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like financial fraud, data encr...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like unauthorized access and da...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect and prevent generation of code that could manipulate financial records, alter transaction histories, or comp...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial code generation.
