Average group score: 71.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on security, compliance, and educational transformation of potentially harmful requests. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., credit scoring manipulation) that could have been consolidated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including encryption, payment processing, and financial calculations. However, there are gaps in addressing emerging technologies and edge-case scenarios, such as AI-driven financial analysis or blockchain-specific vulnerabilities.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, particularly with the repeated specs on credit scoring manipulation. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. However, the repeated specs and some overly broad requirements may pose challenges in real-world implementation, particularly in maintaining consistency across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like encryption, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a wide range of scenarios, including security vulnerabilities, regulatory complianc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like encryption, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling co...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like encry...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 71/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on security, compliance, and educational transforma...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including encryption, payment processing, and fi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 63/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on security, complian...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including payment processing, regulatory compliance, en...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST initiate clarifying dialogue when financial code requests lack essential regulatory context, asking specific questi...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on security, compliance, and educational transformation of potentially harmful requests.
