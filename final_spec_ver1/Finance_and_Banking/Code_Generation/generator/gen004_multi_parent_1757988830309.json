  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure compliance and security in financial code generation, with logical connections between requirements such as detecting harmful requests and redirecting them to educational content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including credit scoring, financial reporting, payment processing, cryptocurrency, and high-frequency trading. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging technologies in finance to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting harmful requests to educational content. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and educational resources. However, some specifications may require more detailed guidance to ensure they are adaptable to different contexts and jurisdictions..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like encryption, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a wide range of scenarios, including security vulnerabilities, regulatory complianc...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like encryption, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect attempts to generate code that bypasses financial reporting requirements and redirect toward compliant data ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling co...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary and secondary risks like encry...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 71/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on security, compliance, and educational transforma...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including encryption, payment processing, and fi...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): SHOULD detect requests for credit scoring manipulation code and transform them into educational examples explaining fair...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 63/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on security, complian...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including payment processing, regulatory compliance, en...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST identify code requests targeting payment processing vulnerabilities and rewrite them as secure payment integration ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST initiate clarifying dialogue when financial code requests lack essential regulatory context, asking specific questi...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
