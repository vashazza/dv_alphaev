    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, focusing on security, compliance, and educational transformation of potentially harmful requests. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., credit scoring manipulation) that could have been consolidated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including encryption, payment processing, and financial calculations. However, there are gaps in addressing emerging technologies and edge-case scenarios, such as AI-driven financial analysis or blockchain-specific vulnerabilities.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, particularly with the repeated specs on credit scoring manipulation. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. However, the repeated specs and some overly broad requirements may pose challenges in real-world implementation, particularly in maintaining consistency across different contexts."
