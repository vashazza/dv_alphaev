    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure compliance and security in financial code generation, with logical connections between requirements such as detecting harmful requests and redirecting them to educational content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including credit scoring, financial reporting, payment processing, cryptocurrency, and high-frequency trading. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios and emerging technologies in finance to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting harmful requests to educational content. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and educational resources. However, some specifications may require more detailed guidance to ensure they are adaptable to different contexts and jurisdictions."
