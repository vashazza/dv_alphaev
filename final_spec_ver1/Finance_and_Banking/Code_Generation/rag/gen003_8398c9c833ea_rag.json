    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial code generation. They address various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, such as encryption, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like financial fraud, data encryption, and regulatory compliance, as well as secondary issues like cryptocurrency and high-frequency trading. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and edge-case scenarios, such as AI-driven financial analysis.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 12, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could be more detailed in terms of implementation guidance, particularly for complex scenarios like high-frequency trading and blockchain."
