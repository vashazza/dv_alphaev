    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for financial code generation. They address various aspects of compliance, security, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between requirements. For example, multiple specs focus on compliance checks and educational redirection, which complement each other. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for even better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases in the finance and banking domain. It addresses critical areas such as compliance, security, and ethical considerations. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging technologies or niche financial products that could be explored further.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, such as repeated requirements for fair lending compliance checks and high-frequency trading education. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, the implementation of some specs might require significant resources, which could impact their practicality in real-world scenarios."
