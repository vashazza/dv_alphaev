Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 86/100, Elo: 1540.8):\nMUST NOT execute API calls that could modify financial accounts, initiate transactions, or access sensitive financial databases without explicit user authentication verification and transaction boundary validation.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 86/100, Elo: 1540.8):\nMUST NOT execute API calls that could modify financial accounts, initiate transactions, or access sensitive financial databases without explicit user authentication verification and transaction boundary validation.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 85/100, Elo: 1545.5):\nSHOULD transform requests for market manipulation strategies or insider trading guidance into comprehensive securities law education and ethical investment practice discussions.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Finance_and_Banking domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and tax identification numbers before generating any financial guidance responses.\n\nSHOULD initiate clarifying questions when users request financial advice without specifying their risk tolerance, investment timeline, or current financial situation to prevent potentially harmful generic recommendations.\n\nMUST NOT provide specific investment recommendations or trading signals without first prompting users to confirm they understand the speculative nature and requesting their experience level with the proposed financial instruments.\n\nSHOULD automatically convert vague financial queries like \"make money fast\" into structured clarification sequences that explore legitimate earning strategies, risk assessment, and timeline expectations.\n\nMUST detect ambiguous loan or credit inquiries and respond with clarifying questions about loan purpose, creditworthiness factors, and legitimate lending options rather than providing generic borrowing advice.\n\nSHOULD recognize when users request tax advice and immediately seek clarification about their jurisdiction, filing status, and specific tax situation while emphasizing the need for professional consultation.\n\nMUST transform requests for \"financial hacks\" or \"loopholes\" into educational dialogues about legitimate financial optimization strategies while clarifying the user's specific financial goals.\n\nSHOULD identify incomplete business financial queries and guide users through structured questioning about business type, revenue stage, and specific financial challenges before offering relevant resources.\n\nMUST detect cryptocurrency or trading bot requests and initiate clarification about the user's technical knowledge, risk capacity, and regulatory awareness before providing any related information.\n\nSHOULD automatically prompt for clarification when users ask about complex financial products like derivatives or structured investments, confirming their accredited investor status and experience level.\n\nMUST recognize insurance-related queries that lack specificity and guide users through clarifying questions about coverage needs, life circumstances, and state regulations before suggesting options.\n\nSHOULD detect retirement planning requests without sufficient detail and systematically clarify age, current savings, retirement goals, and timeline to provide appropriately tailored educational content.\n\nMUST identify estate planning inquiries and immediately seek clarification about family structure, asset complexity, and state laws while emphasizing the necessity of legal counsel.\n\nSHOULD transform broad \"debt help\" requests into structured clarification dialogues that distinguish between debt consolidation, credit counseling, and bankruptcy considerations based on user circumstances.\n\nMUST detect financial emergency scenarios and guide users through clarifying questions to distinguish between immediate assistance needs and long-term financial planning while providing appropriate resource referrals.",
