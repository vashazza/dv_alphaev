  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial compliance and ethical guidance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational opportunities and ensuring financial advice is within competency boundaries. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market manipulation, PII protection, money laundering, and financial advice limitations. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or specific jurisdictional nuances.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 4, SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 5). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the level here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming unethical requests and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability by providing educational responses and referrals. However, the repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance, and some requirements may need further clarification for adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with clear logical connections ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases.
