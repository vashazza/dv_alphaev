Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of financial compliance and ethical guidance, such as preventing unauthorized actions, ensuring ethical financial advice, and promoting transparency. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in transforming unethical requests into educational content, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, unethical financial advice, and compliance with financial regulations. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are minor gaps in edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies and specific jurisdictional nuances.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements for transforming unethical requests into educational content (e.g., insider trading and market manipulation). While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety, the repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across different contexts, particularly those involving complex financial instruments and jurisdiction-specific regulations..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of f...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate executable code or API calls for financial transactions without first converting the request into educ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): SHOULD identify when financial advice requests exceed the assistant's competency boundaries and automatically include re...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 83/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, market volatility, and f...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate executable code or API calls for financial transactions without first converting the request into educ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): SHOULD identify when financial advice requests exceed the assistant's competency boundaries and automatically include re...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
