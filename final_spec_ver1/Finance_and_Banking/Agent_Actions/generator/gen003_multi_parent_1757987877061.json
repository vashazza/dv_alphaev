Average group score: 86.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of financial safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial transactions, advice, and security. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. However, there could be more explicit links between some specs to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like transaction safety, ethical guidance, regulatory compliance, and user protection. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies or specific edge cases related to new financial products and services..

They complement each other by covering different facets of financial transactions, advice, and security. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. However, there could be more explicit links between some specs to enhance overall cohesion.\nâ€¢ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like transaction safety, ethical guidance, regulatory compliance, and user protection. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies or specific edge cases related to new financial products and services.\nâ€¢ Redundancy: The group efficiently avoids unnecessary duplication, with some appropriate redundancy in critical safety areas. For example, multiple specs focus on transforming unethical requests into educational content, which reinforces the policy's robustness. However, there are a few overlapping areas, such as predatory practices and consumer protection, that could be consolidated for greater efficiency.\nâ€¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, some specs may require additional clarification or guidance for implementation, particularly in complex scenarios involving regulatory compliance and user authentication.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 82) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card detai...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial ident...\n  - [3] (Score: 85) MUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies or regulatory circumvention into educational cont...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains. Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and tax identification numbers in all financial discussions while preserving educational value through anonymized examples.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 86/100, Elo: 1540.8):\nMUST NOT execute API calls that could modify financial accounts, initiate transactions, or access sensitive financial databases without explicit user authentication verification and transaction boundary validation.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 85/100, Elo: 1545.5):\nSHOULD transform requests for market manipulation strategies or insider trading guidance into comprehensive securities law education and ethical investment practice discussions.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Finance_and_Banking domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
