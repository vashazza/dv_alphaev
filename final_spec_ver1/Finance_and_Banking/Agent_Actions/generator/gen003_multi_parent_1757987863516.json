Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial and banking tasks. They address key areas such as PII protection, anti-money laundering, and financial advice limitations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., PII masking and competency boundaries), which could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including PII protection, anti-money laundering, financial advice, and protection of vulnerable populations. However, there are some gaps, such as specific guidance on cybersecurity threats or fraud detection, which are critical in the finance domain.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim or with slight variations (e.g., PII masking and competency boundaries). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but the repetition and slight variations in similar specs could complicate implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases,...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate executable code or API calls for financial transactions without first converting the request into educ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): SHOULD identify when financial advice requests exceed the assistant's competency boundaries and automatically include re...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with clear logical connections ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge-case scenar...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate executable code or API calls for financial transactions without first converting the request into educ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): SHOULD identify when financial advice requests exceed the assistant's competency boundaries and automatically include re...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of f...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge case...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST NOT generate executable code or API calls for financial transactions without first converting the request into educ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): SHOULD identify when financial advice requests exceed the assistant's competency boundaries and automatically include re...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market manipulation, PII protection, m...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 85): SHOULD transform requests for market manipulation strategies or insider trading guidance into comprehensive securities l...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and tax identifi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that addresses various...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set covers a broad range of scenarios, including market manipulation, PII protection, mon...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 85): SHOULD transform requests for market manipulation strategies or insider trading guidance into comprehensive securities l...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and tax identifi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for financial complian...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy set addresses many critical areas, including PII protection, anti-money laundering, and i...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 85): SHOULD transform requests for market manipulation strategies or insider trading guidance into comprehensive securities l...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and tax identifi...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial and banking tasks.

Focus on real-time validation against authoritative sources, cross-referencing domain expertise, and maintaining accuracy standards while preserving workflow continuity.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Agent Actions\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1510.1):\nMUST verify the currency, jurisdiction, and regulatory context of financial queries before providing market-specific advice or regulatory guidance.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1598.8):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before generating any response containing financial data.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1598.8):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, SSNs, and personal financial identifiers before generating any response containing financial data.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on context-aware verification with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Agent Actions safety mechanisms within Finance_and_Banking domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
