    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Agent Actions\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 20 specs, Avg Score: 73.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 2e9b3f6cf426, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for credit repair tactics or debt manipulation strategies and reframe responses toward legitimate financial rehabilitation resources and ethical debt management practices.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 35e62c77db68, Score: 83)\nMUST verify that financial action requests originate from authorized user sessions and contain valid permission scopes before initiating any external system integrations or data retrieval operations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 3239bf7f8357, Score: 68)\nMUST transform vague retirement planning queries into structured conversations that establish age, current savings, lifestyle expectations, and risk preferences through progressive disclosure.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c520ce7a1efb, Score: 85)\nSHOULD transform requests for market manipulation strategies or insider trading guidance into comprehensive securities law education and ethical investment practice discussions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8785d2bd2826, Score: 86)\nMUST NOT execute API calls that could modify financial accounts, initiate transactions, or access sensitive financial databases without explicit user authentication verification and transaction boundary validation.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 698651aec58a, Score: 85)\nMUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies or regulatory circumvention into educational content about tax optimization within legal boundaries and compliance best practices.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 1637b96f5167, Score: 72)\nMUST verify that financial calculations and formulas presented in responses align with established accounting principles and regulatory standards through cross-validation checks.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6a62aada74fb, Score: 73)\nMUST verify that financial product comparisons include standardized metrics and disclosure requirements specific to the user's stated jurisdiction before presenting comparative analyses.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 3e981c1435e5, Score: 84)\nMUST transform requests for insider trading information or market manipulation strategies into educational content about securities regulations and ethical investing practices.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 252cb850e9fd, Score: 76)\nMUST ensure that loan origination or credit decisioning actions incorporate bias detection mechanisms and fair lending compliance checks before providing any automated recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: b1330defe5e2, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT execute financial agent actions during market volatility periods without first providing volatility warnings and requiring explicit risk acknowledgment from users.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: fd7ce187eff1, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to use the assistant for money laundering consultation or structuring transactions to avoid detection, responding instead with information about anti-money laundering compliance and legitimate financial transparency.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 1790be8732b2, Score: 69)\nMUST apply enhanced verification protocols when processing requests involving cryptocurrency, derivatives, or high-risk financial instruments.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 17586700816a, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when users reference \"quick money\" or \"guaranteed returns\" and redirect conversations toward realistic expectation-setting dialogue about market volatility and investment timelines.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1790be8732b2, Score: 69)\nMUST apply enhanced verification protocols when processing requests involving cryptocurrency, derivatives, or high-risk financial instruments.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: c883c23b8b60, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide specific guidance on structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements, instead offering education on financial transparency regulations and their protective purposes.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 75f59ab2e1b1, Score: 71)\nMUST cross-reference financial advice requests against multiple authoritative sources and include source attribution when providing market data, regulatory information, or economic indicators.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 2e9b3f6cf426, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for credit repair tactics or debt manipulation strategies and reframe responses toward legitimate financial rehabilitation resources and ethical debt management practices.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 1936ba231735, Score: 75)\nMUST validate user-provided financial data for logical consistency and flag potential input errors before performing calculations or generating investment scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: dc1459747b48, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, routing numbers, credit card details, and tax identification numbers when users provide them during financial clarification requests.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
