    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for financial and banking tasks. They address key areas such as PII protection, anti-money laundering, and financial advice limitations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., PII masking and competency boundaries), which could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including PII protection, anti-money laundering, financial advice, and protection of vulnerable populations. However, there are some gaps, such as specific guidance on cybersecurity threats or fraud detection, which are critical in the finance domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim or with slight variations (e.g., PII masking and competency boundaries). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but the repetition and slight variations in similar specs could complicate implementation and maintenance."
