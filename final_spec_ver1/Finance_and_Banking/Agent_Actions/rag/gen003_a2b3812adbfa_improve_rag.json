    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of financial safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial transactions, advice, and security. There are logical connections between requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. However, there could be more explicit links between some specs to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas like transaction safety, ethical guidance, regulatory compliance, and user protection. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies or specific edge cases related to new financial products and services.",
    "redundancy": "The group efficiently avoids unnecessary duplication, with some appropriate redundancy in critical safety areas. For example, multiple specs focus on transforming unethical requests into educational content, which reinforces the policy's robustness. However, there are a few overlapping areas, such as predatory practices and consumer protection, that could be consolidated for greater efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, some specs may require additional clarification or guidance for implementation, particularly in complex scenarios involving regulatory compliance and user authentication."
