    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of financial safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of financial transactions, advice, and security. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming unethical requests into educational content and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. The strategy is coherent, with a strong emphasis on ethical practices and user protection.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical areas such as unauthorized access, market manipulation, predatory practices, and financial transparency. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies and digital currencies, which are becoming increasingly relevant in the finance and banking domain.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap in the transformation of unethical requests into educational content (e.g., Specs 3 and 5), this redundancy serves to reinforce critical safety areas. The specifications generally avoid unnecessary duplication, maintaining robustness without excessive repetition. The redundancy present is appropriate for ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical compliance areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, some specifications may require significant resources to implement, such as cross-referencing regulatory databases or validating user-provided data, which could impact their practicality in real-world scenarios."
