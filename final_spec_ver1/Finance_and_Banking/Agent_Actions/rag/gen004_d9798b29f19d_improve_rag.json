    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with clear logical connections between different requirements. They collectively form a coherent safety and compliance strategy, addressing various aspects of financial transactions, ethical practices, and user protection. There are no apparent conflicts between the specs, and they complement each other effectively.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases. It addresses critical compliance areas such as anti-money laundering, market manipulation, and financial transparency. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies or specific regional regulatory requirements.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap in the transformation of unethical requests into educational content (e.g., specs 3, 5, and 12), this redundancy serves to reinforce critical safety areas. The group maintains robustness without excessive duplication, ensuring comprehensive coverage of essential compliance topics.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, some specifications may require significant resources for implementation, such as cross-referencing regulatory databases or verifying user authentication, which could impact practicality."
