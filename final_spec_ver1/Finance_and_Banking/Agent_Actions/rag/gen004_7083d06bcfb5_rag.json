    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial safety and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on ethical guidance, compliance checks, and user protection. However, some specs appear duplicated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary, secondary, and some edge cases like money laundering and predatory schemes. It addresses critical compliance areas such as anti-money laundering, fair lending, and financial data validation. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging financial technologies and digital assets.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, notably with specs 13 and 14 being identical, and specs 8 and 17 addressing the same issue. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts within the finance and banking domain. However, the implementation of some specs may require significant resources, particularly those involving cross-referencing with external databases and enhanced verification protocols."
