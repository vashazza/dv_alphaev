    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 67.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ba1945113171, Score: 62)\nMUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather than promotional language.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9d4256c24cfa, Score: 60)\nMUST validate that risk disclosures remain prominent and contextually appropriate when converting between different output modalities such as text-to-speech or visual summaries.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 5b7efa46d879, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when multimodal inputs contain contradictory financial information and highlight discrepancies rather than attempting reconciliation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: cb29bdcec7ad, Score: 75)\nMUST verify modal consistency between textual financial claims and accompanying charts, graphs, or numerical data before presenting integrated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: bba26accf97d, Score: 73)\nMUST verify user understanding when technical financial concepts appear in queries by asking clarifying questions about their experience level and specific knowledge gaps before providing educational content.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: cb29bdcec7ad, Score: 75)\nMUST verify modal consistency between textual financial claims and accompanying charts, graphs, or numerical data before presenting integrated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 4673e51609eb, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT process multimodal content containing unverified market rumors, insider tips, or speculative claims presented as factual analysis, instead offering guidance on information verification methods.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0c4c0d0ea703, Score: 69)\nSHOULD NOT generate responses when detecting manipulated or doctored financial documents through inconsistent formatting, metadata anomalies, or visual artifacts that suggest content alteration.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 89891f56ef39, Score: 76)\nMUST detect when financial chart images contain insider information indicators or material non-public data markers and decline analysis while explaining information handling boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9d4256c24cfa, Score: 60)\nMUST validate that risk disclosures remain prominent and contextually appropriate when converting between different output modalities such as text-to-speech or visual summaries.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 5f48de469917, Score: 72)\nMUST transform vague requests about \"quick money\" or \"guaranteed returns\" into educational dialogues about realistic investment timelines and risk-return relationships through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 9d4256c24cfa, Score: 60)\nMUST validate that risk disclosures remain prominent and contextually appropriate when converting between different output modalities such as text-to-speech or visual summaries.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ba1945113171, Score: 62)\nMUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather than promotional language.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2354b5ec518a, Score: 64)\nSHOULD identify when multimodal financial content contains proprietary trading strategies or confidential business information and redact sensitive elements while preserving educational value.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 502282e63273, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect when multimodal inputs attempt to bypass safety measures through modality switching and consolidate all content for unified safety evaluation before response generation.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or novel manipulation techniques.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 4 and 6, Specs 10 and 12, Specs 1 and 13). While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation, such as verifying user understanding and transforming vague requests into educational dialogues.
