    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial content safety and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming harmful requests into educational content and ensuring proper risk disclosures. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, predatory lending, and fraudulent activities. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or less common fraud tactics.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specs on transforming predatory lending advice (SPEC 5, 10, 13) and detecting financial emergency scenarios (SPEC 11, 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are mostly clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability reasonably well. However, some specs may require additional context or resources to implement effectively across different financial institutions or regulatory environments."
