    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring compliance and safety in the finance and banking domain. They address various aspects of financial communication, regulatory compliance, and user protection. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 6, SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15) which could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, financial communication, elder financial abuse, and data integrity. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit coverage for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies, which are increasingly relevant in the finance domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy with identical specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 6, SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, particularly in areas like elder financial abuse and ethical debt collection. However, the presence of redundant specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality."
