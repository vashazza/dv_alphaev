    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of financial content handling, such as confidentiality, legality, and fraud prevention, with logical connections between them. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including proprietary information protection, speculative content, compliance violations, and fraud detection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or novel fraud tactics.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications (SPEC 5, 10, 13 and SPEC 11, 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability well, but the repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance. Additionally, some specs might require more detailed guidelines to ensure adaptability across different contexts."
