    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring the integrity and reliability of financial information across modalities. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as detecting manipulation, ensuring consistency, and validating disclosures. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market manipulation, risk disclosures, insider information, and user understanding. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, but there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or novel manipulation techniques.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 4 and 6, Specs 10 and 12, Specs 1 and 13). While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation, such as verifying user understanding and transforming vague requests into educational dialogues. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently across all contexts, particularly those involving nuanced judgment calls, like detecting manipulated documents."
