    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventing misinformation, fraud, and unethical practices in financial content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 10 are identical), which slightly detracts from the overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration in the policy set.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, market manipulation, and risk disclosures. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but lacks explicit coverage of some edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or cross-border financial regulations, which could be critical in a comprehensive compliance strategy.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy in the policy set, with multiple identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 10; SPEC 12, 13, and 14). This repetition indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be streamlined without losing robustness. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the current level is excessive and could be consolidated.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidance on how to handle sensitive content and risky scenarios. However, the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, as it could lead to confusion or oversight in policy enforcement."
