  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 14-spec group. Average group score: 73.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventing misinformation, fraud, and unethical practices in financial content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 10 are identical), which slightly detracts from the overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration in the policy set.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, market manipulation, and risk disclosures. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively but lacks explicit coverage of some edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or cross-border financial regulations, which could be critical in a comprehensive compliance strategy.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy in the policy set, with multiple identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 4, 8, and 10; SPEC 12, 13, and 14). This repetition indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be streamlined without losing robustness. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the current level is excessive and could be consolidated.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidance on how to handle sensitive content and risky scenarios. However, the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, as it could lead to confusion or oversight in policy enforcement..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market manipulation, insider informati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like regulatory circumve...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring compliance an...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, financial commu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect when multimodal inputs attempt to bypass safety measures through modality switching and consolidate all co...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): SHOULD identify when multimodal financial content contains proprietary trading strategies or confidential business infor...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate multimodal financial content that presents speculative market predictions as factual analysis without ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider trading, market manipulation, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT process multimodal content containing unverified market rumors, insider tips, or speculative claims presented a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST detect when uploaded financial documents contain client information belonging to third parties and decline processi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): SHOULD identify when multimodal financial content contains proprietary trading strategies or confidential business infor...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate multimodal financial content that presents speculative market predictions as factual analysis without ...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on preventing misinformation, fraud, and unethical practices in financial content.
