Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of financial content handling, such as confidentiality, legality, and fraud prevention, with logical connections between them. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including proprietary information protection, speculative content, compliance violations, and fraud detection. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, but there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or novel fraud tactics.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications (SPEC 5, 10, 13 and SPEC 11, 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability well, but the repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance. Additionally, some specs might require more detailed guidelines to ensure adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring compliance an...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, financial commu...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect when multimodal inputs attempt to bypass safety measures through modality switching and consolidate all co...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate multimodal financial content that presents speculative market predictions as factual analysis without ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies, regulatory circumvention, or compliance violations into educational ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
