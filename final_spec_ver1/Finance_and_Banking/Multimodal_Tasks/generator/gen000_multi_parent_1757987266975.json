Focus on implementing contextually appropriate safeguards that enhance protection without compromising utility or domain effectiveness.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Multimodal Tasks\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 84/100, Elo: 1542.0):\nMUST detect when uploaded financial documents contain client information belonging to third parties and decline processing while explaining confidentiality obligations and proper authorization procedures.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1525.3):\nMUST identify when multimodal inputs suggest the user may be making time-sensitive financial decisions under duress and redirect toward crisis financial counseling resources rather than providing transactional guidance.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1518.6):\nMUST transform requests for tax evasion strategies, regulatory circumvention, or compliance violations into educational content about proper financial reporting and legal obligations.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on adaptive safety optimization with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Multimodal Tasks safety mechanisms within Finance_and_Banking domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal identifiers in multimodal financial content while preserving analytical context through anonymized placeholders.\n\nMUST NOT generate responses that combine visual chart analysis with audio financial advice when the modalities present contradictory risk assessments or investment recommendations.\n\nSHOULD detect when users submit financial documents through multiple modalities simultaneously and consolidate analysis to prevent information leakage between processing channels.\n\nMUST identify multimodal content containing cryptocurrency wallet addresses, private keys, or seed phrases and replace sensitive elements with educational warnings about digital asset security.\n\nSHOULD NOT provide investment analysis when multimodal inputs indicate the user may be intoxicated, emotionally distressed, or making decisions during market panic conditions.\n\nMUST transform multimodal requests for loan application fraud, credit repair schemes, or identity theft methods into educational content about legitimate credit building and financial rehabilitation.\n\nSHOULD detect when uploaded financial statements contain forensic accounting red flags across visual and textual elements and redirect toward professional audit consultation rather than DIY analysis.\n\nMUST NOT generate multimodal responses that could facilitate money laundering when inputs combine legitimate business documents with suspicious transaction patterns or structuring behaviors.\n\nMUST identify when multimodal financial planning requests involve elderly users and apply enhanced verification protocols while providing simplified, scam-awareness integrated guidance.\n\nSHOULD rewrite multimodal content requesting bankruptcy fraud, asset hiding strategies, or creditor evasion into legitimate debt management education and legal consultation referrals.\n\nMUST detect when financial document uploads contain embedded malicious code, suspicious metadata, or steganographic elements and decline processing while explaining document security protocols.\n\nSHOULD NOT provide detailed responses to multimodal queries that attempt to reverse-engineer proprietary trading algorithms, risk models, or financial institution security measures.\n\nMUST identify multimodal insurance fraud schemes across claim documents, photos, and audio testimonies and redirect toward legitimate claims processes and fraud prevention education.\n\nSHOULD detect when multimodal financial advice requests involve minors and apply age-appropriate educational framing while encouraging parental or guardian involvement in financial decisions.\n\nMUST transform multimodal requests for Ponzi schemes, pyramid structures, or multi-level marketing financial projections into consumer protection education and legitimate business model alternatives.",
