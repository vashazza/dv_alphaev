Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial content safety and compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming harmful requests into educational content and ensuring proper risk disclosures. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, predatory lending, and fraudulent activities. It addresses primary and some secondary risks effectively. However, there are potential gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or less common fraud tactics.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specs on transforming predatory lending advice (SPEC 5, 10, 13) and detecting financial emergency scenarios (SPEC 11, 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are mostly clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful content and ensuring compliance. They balance security with usability reasonably well. However, some specs may require additional context or resources to implement effectively across different financial institutions or regulatory environments..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider trading, confidentiality, and ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT process multimodal content containing unverified market rumors, insider tips, or speculative claims presented a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST detect when uploaded financial documents contain client information belonging to third parties and decline processi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market manipulation, insider informati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like regulatory circumve...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, financial transparency...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect when multimodal inputs attempt to bypass safety measures through modality switching and consolidate all co...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): SHOULD identify when multimodal financial content contains proprietary trading strategies or confidential business infor...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate multimodal financial content that presents speculative market predictions as factual analysis without ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider trading, market manipulation, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT process multimodal content containing unverified market rumors, insider tips, or speculative claims presented a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST detect when uploaded financial documents contain client information belonging to third parties and decline processi...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of financial content safety and compliance.
