  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring compliance and safety in the finance and banking domain. They address various aspects of financial communication, regulatory compliance, and user protection. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 6, SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15) which could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, financial communication, elder financial abuse, and data integrity. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit coverage for emerging financial technologies or digital currencies, which are increasingly relevant in the finance domain.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy with identical specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 6, SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, particularly in areas like elder financial abuse and ethical debt collection. However, the presence of redundant specs may complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider trading, confidentiality, and ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT process multimodal content containing unverified market rumors, insider tips, or speculative claims presented a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST detect when uploaded financial documents contain client information belonging to third parties and decline processi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including market manipulation, insider informati...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like regulatory circumve...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST detect potential market manipulation content across modalities and rewrite with neutral, educational framing rather...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of scenarios, including regulatory compliance, financial transparency...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT provide responses to queries seeking methods to circumvent banking regulations, anti-money laundering controls,...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect when multimodal inputs attempt to bypass safety measures through modality switching and consolidate all co...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including speculative content, insider trading, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 64): SHOULD identify when multimodal financial content contains proprietary trading strategies or confidential business infor...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST NOT generate multimodal financial content that presents speculative market predictions as factual analysis without ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including insider trading, market manipulation, ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT process multimodal content containing unverified market rumors, insider tips, or speculative claims presented a...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST detect when uploaded financial documents contain client information belonging to third parties and decline processi...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring compliance and safety in the finance and banking domain.
