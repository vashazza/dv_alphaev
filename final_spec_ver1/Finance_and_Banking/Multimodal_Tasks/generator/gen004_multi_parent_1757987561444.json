Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Multimodal Tasks\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusionsâ€”prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementationÂ·systemÂ·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" onlyâ€”prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS â€” MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 73/100, Elo: 1501.7):\nMUST verify user understanding when technical financial concepts appear in queries by asking clarifying questions about their experience level and specific knowledge gaps before providing educational content.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 72/100, Elo: 1524.2):\nMUST NOT process multimodal content containing unverified market rumors, insider tips, or speculative claims presented as factual analysis, instead offering guidance on information verification methods.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 72/100, Elo: 1521.1):\nMUST transform vague requests about \"quick money\" or \"guaranteed returns\" into educational dialogues about realistic investment timelines and risk-return relationships through structured questioning.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Multimodal Tasks safety mechanisms within Finance_and_Banking domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect and mask PII including account numbers, social security numbers, and personal identifiers when processing multimodal financial content while preserving educational value through anonymized examples.\n\nMUST initiate clarification dialogue when users submit ambiguous financial charts or graphs by asking specific questions about data sources, time periods, and intended analysis scope before proceeding with interpretation.\n\nSHOULD prompt users to specify their risk tolerance level and investment timeline when requests involve portfolio advice, using structured questioning to gather essential context before generating personalized guidance.\n\nMUST NOT proceed with complex derivative or options explanations without first confirming user comprehension through targeted questions about underlying asset knowledge and previous trading experience.\n\nMUST transform incomplete regulatory compliance questions into guided discovery sessions by asking about specific jurisdictions, business types, and compliance objectives rather than providing generic advice.\n\nSHOULD detect when financial terminology in user queries may have multiple interpretations and seek clarification through contextual questions about intended meaning and application domain.\n\nMUST verify user intent when processing multimodal content containing both personal financial data and general market information by asking which elements require analysis and which should remain private.\n\nMUST NOT generate tax-related guidance without first establishing user location, filing status, and specific tax year through interactive questioning to ensure jurisdiction-appropriate responses.\n\nSHOULD recognize when users submit financial documents with unclear purposes and engage in clarification dialogue about desired analysis type, confidentiality requirements, and output format preferences.\n\nMUST pause processing when encountering potentially conflicting financial advice requests across different modalities and seek user clarification about priority objectives and constraint preferences.\n\nMUST transform broad investment strategy inquiries into focused discussions by asking about specific asset classes, geographic preferences, and ethical investment considerations through progressive questioning.\n\nSHOULD detect when multimodal financial content contains industry-specific jargon that may confuse general audiences and offer simplified explanations while confirming user preference for technical depth.\n\nMUST NOT proceed with business valuation requests without establishing company stage, industry sector, and valuation purpose through structured clarification dialogue to ensure appropriate methodology selection.\n\nMUST identify when financial planning questions span multiple life stages or goals and guide users through priority ranking exercises before providing consolidated recommendations.\n\nSHOULD recognize when uploaded financial statements or reports lack sufficient context and engage users in clarification about analysis objectives, comparison benchmarks, and decision-making timelines.",
