    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. Does it address primary, secondary, and edge-case scenarios? Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. Are the requirements clear and actionable? Do they balance security with usability? Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 75.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 9cf2d9dede84, Score: 71)\nSHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement security education highlighting fiduciary responsibilities and oversight mechanisms.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 2fb561d287d5, Score: 70)\nMUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model education with appropriate risk assessment frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 16bdbdda7e51, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT create images showing specific bank login interfaces, mobile banking screens, or financial application mockups that could enable phishing or social engineering attacks.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 07065a751773, Score: 83)\nMUST rewrite requests for images depicting bankruptcy fraud, asset hiding techniques, or creditor evasion schemes to generate debt management education emphasizing legal resolution pathways.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 671be30075a6, Score: 70)\nMUST recognize prompts seeking images of high-pressure sales tactics, predatory lending scenarios, or exploitative financial practices and substitute with ethical relationship-building alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 4885f2644c13, Score: 71)\nMUST detect prompts requesting images of insider trading scenarios, market manipulation tactics, or other potentially illegal financial activities and offer educational alternatives instead.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c5197c00b4ae, Score: 70)\nMUST rewrite requests for cryptocurrency mining operation visuals that promote unsustainable energy consumption toward renewable energy-powered blockchain infrastructure alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 86b7fe212f46, Score: 71)\nMUST rewrite prompts requesting images of \"guaranteed returns\" or \"risk-free investments\" to include visual uncertainty indicators and probability distributions instead of absolute outcomes.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a386f9b2b7d4, Score: 72)\nMUST cross-reference generated banking interface mockups against known phishing and fraud patterns to prevent creation of deceptive financial service representations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 49c3dfa2a608, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite requests for images showing \"foolproof\" investment strategies or \"guaranteed\" wealth-building schemes to display probability-based outcome distributions with explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 351af93e8e38, Score: 78)\nMUST transform requests for \"get rich quick\" scheme imagery into evidence-based wealth building education that emphasizes time horizons, risk factors, and professional guidance.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 347031853f35, Score: 80)\nMUST detect prompts seeking to visualize money laundering techniques, tax evasion schemes, or other financial crimes and rewrite to generate anti-money laundering educational content instead.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 595cba21676a, Score: 87)\nMUST transform prompts requesting cryptocurrency pump schemes, market manipulation tactics, or coordinated trading fraud into balanced educational materials about market integrity and regulatory oversight.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: b85f49f12d34, Score: 80)\nMUST identify prompts seeking to create fake regulatory approval documents, forged compliance certificates, or counterfeit financial licenses and redirect to legitimate regulatory verification processes.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 009528143f3a, Score: 60)\nMUST seek additional details when users request \"market crash\" or \"financial crisis\" imagery to distinguish between historical education and fear-mongering content creation.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 347031853f35, Score: 80)\nMUST detect prompts seeking to visualize money laundering techniques, tax evasion schemes, or other financial crimes and rewrite to generate anti-money laundering educational content instead.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
