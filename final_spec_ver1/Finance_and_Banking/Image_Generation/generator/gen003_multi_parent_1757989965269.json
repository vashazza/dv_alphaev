  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at preventing financial fraud and promoting education. There is a logical connection between different requirements, such as transforming harmful prompts into educational content and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including cryptocurrency fraud, identity theft, predatory lending, and market manipulation. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, though there may be some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios or emerging threats in the financial domain.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, particularly those requiring cross-referencing with regulatory databases..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing and Ponzi ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The group covers a wide range of scenarios, including fraud prevention, ethical financial education,...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios relevant to finance and banking, including fraud ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing, fraud, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at preven...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including cryptocurrency fraud, identity theft, p...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform prompts requesting cryptocurrency pump schemes, market manipulation tactics, or coordinated trading fraud...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate visual representations of credit repair scams, identity theft recovery fraud, or credit score manipula...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent strategy aimed at promoting ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including protecting vulnerable populations, pre...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at preventing financial fraud and promoting education.
