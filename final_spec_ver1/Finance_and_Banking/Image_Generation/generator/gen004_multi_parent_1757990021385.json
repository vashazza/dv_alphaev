  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Finance & Banking\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promoting ethical and educational financial imagery. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial image generation, such as protecting vulnerable populations, ensuring fair representation, and preventing misleading content. However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including the protection of vulnerable populations, prevention of deceptive imagery, and promotion of financial education. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 1, 2, 9, 11, and 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios relevant to finance and banking, including fraud ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at transf...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including deceptive imagery, financial scams, id...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at transf...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of financial risks, including cryptocurrency fraud, identity t...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST transform prompts requesting cryptocurrency pump schemes, market manipulation tactics, or coordinated trading fraud...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate visual representations of credit repair scams, identity theft recovery fraud, or credit score manipula...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent strategy aimed at promoting ethi...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including protecting vulnerable populations, pre...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
