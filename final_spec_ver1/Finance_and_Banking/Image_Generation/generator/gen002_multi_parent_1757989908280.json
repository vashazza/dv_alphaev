Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promoting ethical and secure financial image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial misrepresentation and risk, such as phishing, unethical practices, and misleading investment visuals. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing and Ponzi schemes, as well as secondary issues like unethical sales tactics and insider trading. Edge cases, such as the use of demographic data in financial images, are also considered. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and their associated risks.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 11 and 12, Specs 14 and 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives and emphasizing ethical practices. However, some specifications might require additional context or clarification to ensure they are adaptable across different financial contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing and financ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at redire...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing, fraud, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing and Ponzi ...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including the protection of vulnerable population...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at transf...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including deceptive imagery, financial scams, id...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 67): MUST transform requests for financial imagery targeting vulnerable populations into general financial education visuals ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nðŸ’¬ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at promot...\nðŸ’¬ Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing, fraud, an...\n\n  â€¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD rewrite prompts seeking to visualize pension fund mismanagement or retirement account theft into retirement secur...\n  â€¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST detect attempts to visualize Ponzi or pyramid scheme structures and redirect to sustainable business model educatio...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\nâ€¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promoting ethical and secure financial image generation.
