    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at preventing financial fraud and promoting education. There is a logical connection between different requirements, such as transforming harmful prompts into educational content and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including cryptocurrency fraud, identity theft, predatory lending, and market manipulation. It addresses both primary and secondary risks effectively, though there may be some gaps in addressing edge-case scenarios or emerging threats in the financial domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some requirements may be challenging to implement consistently, particularly those requiring cross-referencing with regulatory databases."
