    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at promoting ethical financial practices and preventing misuse of image generation for harmful purposes. They complement each other by redirecting potentially harmful prompts to educational content, which aligns with a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing and financial fraud, as well as secondary issues such as unethical financial practices and misinformation. While it addresses many critical areas, there are some edge cases, such as emerging financial technologies, that could be more explicitly covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar themes, such as financial fraud and unethical practices. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by redirecting harmful prompts to educational content. However, some specifications may require additional context or clarification to ensure adaptability across different contexts."
