    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promoting ethical and educational financial imagery. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial image generation, such as protecting vulnerable populations, ensuring fair representation, and preventing misleading content. However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a wide range of scenarios, including the protection of vulnerable populations, prevention of deceptive imagery, and promotion of financial education. It addresses primary and secondary risks effectively, though there could be more emphasis on edge-case scenarios, such as emerging financial technologies or niche financial products.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 1, 2, 9, 11, and 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, the repeated specs could complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality."
