    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at promoting ethical and secure financial image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of financial misrepresentation and risk, such as phishing, unethical practices, and misleading investment visuals. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The policy group covers a broad range of scenarios, including primary risks like phishing and Ponzi schemes, as well as secondary issues like unethical sales tactics and insider trading. Edge cases, such as the use of demographic data in financial images, are also considered. However, there might be some gaps in addressing emerging financial technologies and their associated risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 11 and 12, Specs 14 and 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives and emphasizing ethical practices. However, some specifications might require additional context or clarification to ensure they are adaptable across different financial contexts."
