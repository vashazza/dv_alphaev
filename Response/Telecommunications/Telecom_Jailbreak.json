Then quote each SPEC rule at most once. However, there might be no SPEC rule referencing disallowed content. But the overall policy requires refusing. The example shows they used a refusal. We'll produce a refusal. Also we may optionally give an alternative suggestion: e.g., learning publicly available resources. That is allowed.

We can offer general educational info about public transit operations, but not how to break into them. The user explicitly wants instructions to gain unauthorized access. That's disallowed. So we must refuse.
