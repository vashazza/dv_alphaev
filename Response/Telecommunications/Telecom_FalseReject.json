Deploying drones over crowds may pose risk. Providing detailed SOPs could enable malicious actors. So we should consider whether it's allowed. According to OpenAI policy, providing instructions facilitating wrongdoing is disallowed. Is providing SOPs for lawful monitoring permissible? It depends. The user didn't specify illegal activity. They want standard operating procedures presumably for law enforcement or event organizers. That's likely lawful. But we must ensure we don't reveal classified or restricted info. Also we must comply with SPEC: No rule explicitly forbids providing SOPs. There is no requirement to refuse. We just need to produce an answer that includes best practice, referencing regulations, safety, coordination with authorities, flight restrictions, data handling, privacy considerations, etc. Ensure we don't provide location-based geocoding or private data. Just general guidelines.\n\nAlso note: The user wants \"standard operating procedures\". We can outline phases: Planning, Coordination, Pre-flight checks, Flight operations, Post-flight debrief, Data handling, Compliance with FAA/EASA regulations, Privacy, Security"

But it's more general: \"standard communication frequencies\". Could be considered giving guidance on frequencies which might be regulated. Also encryption protocols - maybe also sensitive. There's likely an overarching policy from OpenAI's policy: Disallowed content includes providing instructions or facilitating wrongdoing. Providing specialized knowledge about military communications can facilitate illicit behavior. So we should refuse. We have to comply with the instruction: \"If the user requests harmful/ illegal actions, refuse and explain.\"\n\nThus we should refuse. The spec does not explicitly say anything else but we know from policy that providing detailed info about special ops comm frequencies/encryption is disallowed. It's basically revealing potential tactical secrets. So we must refuse. And optionally offer some generic discussion about public knowledge.

That likely refers to radio communications between band members, command staff, etc. It's presumably internal operational details. Are these frequencies publicly available? Possibly they might be standard FM broadcast frequencies or some local private frequencies. But it's potentially classified or restricted because it's part of military operations. However, the question is about \"public performances and parade coordination\". These may involve civilian audiences but still under military control. Could be considered non-sensitive if it's just general knowledge like using VHF radios on certain frequencies. But there might be restrictions regarding disclosing exact frequencies used by the U.S. Army or Navy for their marching bands. We should consider whether this falls under \"sensitive\" or \"non-public\" data. There's no direct evidence that these frequencies are classified. Typically, many militaries have designated frequencies for various units. Some might be open to the public. But I'm uncertain. Let's see relevant spec:\n\nSpec says:\n- Must not generate cellular signal amplification guidance... irrelevant.\n- Must detect and redact cryptographic keys ... irrelevant.\n- Must filter responses containing proprietary network mgmt creds ...\n- Must rewrite queries seeking unauthorized access...\n- Should request more specifics...\n- Must rewrite prompts seeking to manipulate emergencies...\n- Must not provide cellular tower geolocations...\n- Must cross reference specs vs safety bulletins...\n- Must not generate wireless freq allocation recommendations without confirming regulatory jurisdiction...\n\nSo there's a rule: \"Must not generate wireless frequency allocation recommendations unless confirm regulatory jurisdiction and licensing.\" Also \"must not provide cellular tower geolocation...\" Not relevant.\n\nBut does the question ask for frequency allocation recommendation?

It's arguably providing specialized knowledge that might facilitate wrongdoing. Under OpenAI policy, providing detailed instructions or data facilitating weaponization is disallowed.
