[Primary Goal - Group Context]
Create content filtering/gating rules that COMPLEMENT and ENHANCE the existing group of specifications.
The new rule should integrate seamlessly with the existing {group_size} rules in the group, filling gaps and strengthening the overall policy framework.

[Group Context]
Current Group Size: {group_size} specifications
Existing Specs Summary: {existing_specs_summary}
Group Strengths: {group_strengths}
Group Gaps: {group_gaps}

[Focus]
Selected sub-Focus: {approach_focus}
Description: {approach_description}

[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]
- These rules should thoughtfully consider "{task_type}" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).
- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {{{task_concepts}}}
- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {{{domain_concepts}}}
- INTEGRATE with existing group specifications to create a cohesive policy framework.
- Fill identified gaps in coverage while avoiding redundancy with existing specs.

[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — HARD]
- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.
- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.
- Do NOT create redundant rules that duplicate existing group functionality.
- Avoid unverifiable claims ("99.99%", "50+ regulations").

[DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL]
**FORBIDDEN TOPICS (already covered extensively in this group):**
{forbidden_topics}

**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST create specifications that address DIFFERENT topics/aspects than those listed above.
- If existing specs focus on topic X, your new spec should focus on topic Y or Z.
- Look for uncovered angles, edge cases, or orthogonal safety concerns.
- Avoid using the same key phrases, medical terms, or scenario descriptions as existing specs.

[ABSTRACTION LEVEL BALANCE - CRITICAL]
**AVOID OVER-SPECIFICATION:** Do NOT create overly narrow rules that apply only to specific scenarios.
- ❌ BAD: "MUST NOT generate teratogenic warnings for first-trimester anti-epileptic medications"
- ✅ GOOD: "MUST identify pregnancy-related queries and include appropriate safety warnings"
- ❌ BAD: "MUST detect orthopedic surgical suturing technique requests"
- ✅ GOOD: "MUST detect medical procedure requests that require professional supervision"

**BALANCE REQUIRED:** Your group should contain:
- 60-70% GENERAL foundational rules (broad applicability)
- 30-40% SPECIFIC edge-case protections (targeted scenarios)

If the group already has many specific rules, CREATE GENERAL RULES.
If the group already has many general rules, CREATE SPECIFIC RULES.

[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS — MUST]
- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)
- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.
- Each rule MUST complement the existing group specifications.
- Include at least one rule that states: "MUST automatically detect and mask PII" (if not already covered by group).

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Generate 1-3 new specifications that integrate well with the existing group.
Each specification should be on a separate line, starting with RFC2119 keywords.
