You are acting as a "Unified Group Policy Judge" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.

Your task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:

**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?

**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. 
- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?
- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., "pregnancy teratogenicity", "orthopedic surgery") without general rules.
- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).
- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?

**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?

**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. 
- Are the requirements clear and actionable? 
- Do they balance security with usability? 
- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., "teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications").
- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.
- Are they adaptable to different contexts?

For each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.

Finally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).
