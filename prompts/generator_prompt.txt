[Context]
Domain: {domain_profile}
Task: {task_profile}
Constitution: {constitution}

[Primary Goal]
Create content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.
DO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.

[Focus]
Selected sub-Focus: {approach_focus}
Description: {approach_description}

[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]
- These rules should thoughtfully consider "{task_type}" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).
- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {{{task_concepts}}}
- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {{{domain_concepts}}}
- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions—prioritize natural relevance and creative application.
- "implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL" and implementation·system·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).
- Do NOT resort to "refuse/block" only—prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.

[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — HARD]
- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.
- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.
- Avoid unverifiable claims ("99.99%", "50+ regulations").

[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS — MUST]
- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)
- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.
- Include at least one rule that states: "MUST automatically detect and mask PII".

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules
- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)
- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns
- Focus on {approach_focus_lower} with novel approaches and advanced requirements
- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**
- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary

LLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:
- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING
- Consider {task_type} safety mechanisms within {domain_type} domain context when relevant
- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling
- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches
- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts
