    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on multimodal content safety, privacy, and accuracy. However, there are some overlaps and redundancies, particularly in the handling of PII, which slightly detract from overall cohesion. The specs address various aspects of multimodal content generation, such as bias, misinformation, and user intent, but could benefit from clearer connections between these areas.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of issues relevant to multimodal content, including privacy, bias, misinformation, and accessibility. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, but some critical areas, such as security and ethical considerations, could be more explicitly addressed. The focus on multimodal tasks is comprehensive, but the balance between general and specific rules could be improved.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly in the specifications related to PII detection and masking. Several specs repeat similar requirements, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the extent observed here suggests room for streamlining without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to PII, which may limit flexibility and adaptability. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but the policy set could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules to cover multiple use cases effectively.\n\nTOTAL=75",
