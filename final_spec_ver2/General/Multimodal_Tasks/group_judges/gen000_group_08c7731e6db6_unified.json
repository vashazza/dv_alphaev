    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 73.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ae2752d572bc, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate responses to requests where clarifying questions reveal potential dual-use applications without providing safer alternative approaches that address legitimate underlying needs.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 772d29bad904, Score: 71)\nSHOULD proactively ask disambiguating questions when multimodal inputs could reasonably support multiple interpretations, prioritizing the most safety-conscious interpretation until user intent becomes explicit.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c7785e09a705, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT produce responses to vague requests like \"analyze this\" or \"what do you think\" when multimodal content includes potentially sensitive material without first clarifying the specific analytical scope and intended use case.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: a09ed435be36, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic content designed to spread false narratives.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 6b7f0ba6da68, Score: 68)\nMUST apply progressive content filtering that escalates safety measures when multiple risk indicators are detected across different modalities within a single interaction.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: dde6697e5178, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8c84f5fdb473, Score: 75)\nMUST verify factual claims across all modalities against multiple authoritative sources before generating responses, marking uncertain information with confidence indicators.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 8c84f5fdb473, Score: 75)\nMUST verify factual claims across all modalities against multiple authoritative sources before generating responses, marking uncertain information with confidence indicators.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: b44a0295e754, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT produce outputs containing harmful visual-textual combinations that could amplify dangerous messaging.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 81eb6955713f, Score: 66)\nMUST verify user intent through targeted follow-up questions when multimodal analysis detects potential synthetic media manipulation attempts disguised as legitimate content requests.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 772d29bad904, Score: 71)\nSHOULD proactively ask disambiguating questions when multimodal inputs could reasonably support multiple interpretations, prioritizing the most safety-conscious interpretation until user intent becomes explicit.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a09ed435be36, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic content designed to spread false narratives.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: dde6697e5178, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 8c84f5fdb473, Score: 75)\nMUST verify factual claims across all modalities against multiple authoritative sources before generating responses, marking uncertain information with confidence indicators.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
