    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 79.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: a09ed435be36, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic content designed to spread false narratives.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: dde6697e5178, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 8c84f5fdb473, Score: 75)\nMUST verify factual claims across all modalities against multiple authoritative sources before generating responses, marking uncertain information with confidence indicators.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8c84f5fdb473, Score: 75)\nMUST verify factual claims across all modalities against multiple authoritative sources before generating responses, marking uncertain information with confidence indicators.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a09ed435be36, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal input analysis identifies coordinated manipulation campaigns or synthetic content designed to spread false narratives.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: dde6697e5178, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 8c84f5fdb473, Score: 75)\nMUST verify factual claims across all modalities against multiple authoritative sources before generating responses, marking uncertain information with confidence indicators.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3224c251582c, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including biometric identifiers, financial data, and location coordinates across all modalities before generating any response content.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3224c251582c, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including biometric identifiers, financial data, and location coordinates across all modalities before generating any response content.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 3224c251582c, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including biometric identifiers, financial data, and location coordinates across all modalities before generating any response content.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3224c251582c, Score: 83)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including biometric identifiers, financial data, and location coordinates across all modalities before generating any response content.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: dd676de0f3f9, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information across all modalities before generating responses, replacing specific identifiers with generic placeholders while preserving conversational context.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 3708deb5a03c, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT create composite multimodal outputs that could misrepresent professional credentials, certifications, or institutional affiliations through visual or textual synthesis.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
