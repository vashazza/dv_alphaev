    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal content generation, such as bias detection, PII masking, and fact-checking, which are logically connected and complement each other. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., PII masking), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including accessibility, bias, misinformation, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as domain-specific fact-checking and emotional tone validation. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging technologies or specific user demographics.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with PII masking specifications, which appear multiple times with slight variations. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
