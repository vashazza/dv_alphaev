    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for multimodal tasks. They address various aspects of safety, bias, and factual accuracy, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal content, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and safety. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging modalities or rapidly evolving threats, which could enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, notably the repetition of SPEC 2 and SPEC 7, and similar themes across multiple specs (e.g., consistency verification in SPEC 5 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the group could be more efficient by consolidating overlapping requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could complicate implementation and maintenance, slightly reducing practicality."
