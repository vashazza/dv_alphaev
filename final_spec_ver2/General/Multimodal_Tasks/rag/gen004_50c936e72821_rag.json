    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of multimodal content generation, such as bias, misinformation, and privacy. However, there are some overlaps and redundancies, particularly in the handling of PII, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of issues relevant to multimodal tasks, including accessibility, bias, misinformation, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps in addressing emerging risks, such as deepfake detection or evolving data privacy laws.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, especially in specifications related to PII detection and masking. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and usability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed fact-checking protocols, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
