    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, focusing on multimodal input handling, bias detection, and content verification. There is a clear emphasis on safety and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as bias detection, accessibility, and fact-checking. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of issues related to multimodal tasks, including bias, misinformation, accessibility, and user intent verification. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas like data privacy and user consent are not explicitly covered, leaving potential gaps.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 4 and 6, Specs 5 and 10, Specs 8 and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like bias detection and misinformation. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on multimodal input interpretations, which may limit adaptability across different contexts."
