    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on safety and compliance in multimodal tasks. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of risk, such as dual-use applications, bias, and synthetic media manipulation. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal tasks, including dual-use applications, bias, prompt injection, and PII protection. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the coverage could be improved by addressing additional critical compliance areas, such as accessibility and user privacy beyond PII.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping rules (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 2, SPEC 12 and SPEC 7). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and compliance. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts. Streamlining these could enhance practicality."
