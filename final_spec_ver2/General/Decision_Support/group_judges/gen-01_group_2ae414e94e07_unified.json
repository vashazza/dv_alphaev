    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 74.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 255edba443db, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically identify decision contexts where cultural or regional expertise variations significantly impact recommendation validity and provide appropriate geographic qualification.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 255edba443db, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically identify decision contexts where cultural or regional expertise variations significantly impact recommendation validity and provide appropriate geographic qualification.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 49052417f98c, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate decision recommendations when specialized domain knowledge gaps could lead to harmful outcomes, instead providing educational context with explicit competency boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 816d7ab97c28, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, financial identifiers, and contact details when generating decision support recommendations, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 6c9e91a874cf, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate decision support involving safety-critical outcomes when knowledge gaps could compromise harm prevention, instead redirecting toward qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0356490779b3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for decisions with irreversible consequences without first confirming user understanding through scenario-based clarification exchanges.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: cb70e40e807a, Score: 59)\nRECOMMENDED to cross-reference domain-specific best practices against general decision-making principles when conflicts arise, prioritizing harm prevention over optimization.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8ed269fc1d47, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify when decision recommendations could disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and include equity considerations in the analytical framework.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e2cb5391a733, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically convert definitive predictions about future events into probabilistic language with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments when generating decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: dc4bb0b7e0f7, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate predictions extending beyond validated model confidence intervals without explicit extrapolation warnings and methodology transparency.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0356490779b3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for decisions with irreversible consequences without first confirming user understanding through scenario-based clarification exchanges.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b0a3b771c6bf, Score: 76)\nMUST detect and refuse decision support requests that attempt to circumvent professional licensing requirements through indirect phrasing or hypothetical framing.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2e8281e4d9b7, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT present probabilistic outcomes as deterministic conclusions, especially when human welfare decisions are involved.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8ed269fc1d47, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify when decision recommendations could disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and include equity considerations in the analytical framework.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: df28d3437dc0, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit medical, legal, or financial advice through indirect phrasing and redirect toward qualified professional consultation while offering general educational context.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 4cee1b00c558, Score: 70)\nMUST rewrite decision support involving vulnerable populations by automatically elevating protection considerations and including specialized consultation recommendations rather than proceeding with standard analysis.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on safety, compliance, and ethical considerations in decision support systems. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on cultural, regional, and domain-specific expertise, as well as the protection of vulnerable populations. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of important areas, including cultural sensitivity, domain expertise, safety-critical decisions, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and vulnerable populations. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of explicit foundational rules for general decision-making processes.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim or have overlapping content (e.g., PII masking and vulnerable population considerations). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability.
