    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 0356490779b3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for decisions with irreversible consequences without first confirming user understanding through scenario-based clarification exchanges.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score:

42bfc4fdae5f, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision support requests involve potential conflicts of interest between multiple stakeholders and restructure responses to present balanced perspectives rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: eb0cd4ebc129, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT proceed with resource allocation recommendations when detecting potential discrimination patterns, instead restructuring the analysis around equitable distribution principles and need-based criteria.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e2cb5391a733, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically convert definitive predictions about future events into probabilistic language with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments when generating decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d942e6b65365, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with decision support when stakeholder impacts remain undefined, instead requesting clarification about affected parties and consequences.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6027fb51d187, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize cultural and contextual factors that may influence decision appropriateness and provide culturally sensitive alternatives when recommending courses of action.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 255edba443db, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically identify decision contexts where cultural or regional expertise variations significantly impact recommendation validity and provide appropriate geographic qualification.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 23758eef383f, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in decision support outputs while preserving analytical value through statistical aggregation and anonymization.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 82e1605db3f0, Score: N/A)\nMUST verify that knowledge synthesis incorporates uncertainty quantification when combining information from multiple specialized domains, clearly delineating confidence levels for cross-disciplinary insights.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 82e1605db3f0, Score: N/A)\nMUST verify that knowledge synthesis incorporates uncertainty quantification when

cross-reference domain-specific best practices against general decision-making principles when conflicts arise, prioritizing harm prevention over optimization.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score:

reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 8ed269fc1d47, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify when decision recommendations could disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and include equity considerations in the analytical framework.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of decision support, such as bias detection, PII masking, and cultural sensitivity. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., PII masking and cognitive bias detection), which slightly detract from overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but some specs could be better integrated to enhance the unified strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of decision support risks, including PII protection, bias mitigation, and cultural considerations. However, there is a lack of foundational rules that could provide a more comprehensive framework. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is somewhat skewed, with a tendency towards specific scenarios without enough general rules to support them.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications related to PII masking and cognitive bias detection, which appear multiple times. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts, such as those requiring scenario-based clarification exchanges or geographic qualifications. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=69",
