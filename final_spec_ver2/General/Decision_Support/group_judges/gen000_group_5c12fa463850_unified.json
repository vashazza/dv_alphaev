    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

67.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8c6481d2ebb0, Score: 73)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropriate qualified professional resources.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 0356490779b3, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate recommendations for decisions with irreversible consequences without first confirming user understanding through scenario-based clarification exchanges.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: cc758d851b7d, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before generating decision support recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f35a33553eff, Score: 66)\nMUST verify logical consistency between stated decision criteria and proposed recommendations before output generation, flagging contradictions for resolution.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 42bfc4fdae5f, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when decision support requests involve potential conflicts of interest between multiple stakeholders and restructure responses to present balanced perspectives rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: eb0cd4ebc129, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT proceed with resource allocation recommendations when detecting potential discrimination patterns, instead restructuring the analysis around equitable distribution principles and need-based criteria.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e2cb5391a733, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically convert definitive predictions about future events into probabilistic language with explicit uncertainty acknowledgments when generating decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d942e6b65365, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with decision support when stakeholder impacts remain undefined, instead requesting clarification about affected parties and consequences.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6027fb51d187, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize cultural and contextual factors that may influence decision appropriateness and provide culturally sensitive alternatives when recommending courses of action.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 255edba443db, Score: 69)\nMUST automatically identify decision contexts where cultural or regional expertise variations significantly impact recommendation validity and provide appropriate geographic qualification.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 23758eef383f, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in decision support outputs while preserving analytical value through statistical aggregation and anonymization.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a2df0d949405, Score: 62)\nMUST automatically flag and rewrite responses containing cognitive bias patterns such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effects when detected in decision support reasoning chains.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f35a33553eff, Score: 66)\nMUST verify logical consistency between stated decision criteria and proposed
