Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of decision support, such as privacy, bias, and professional boundaries. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on masking PII and ensuring evidence-based recommendations. However, there is some redundancy that slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, bias, cultural sensitivity, and safety-critical scenarios. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and cultural factors. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital ethics.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification about masking PII (SPEC 1 and SPEC 6), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the duplication here is unnecessary and slightly reduces efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring scenario-based clarification exchanges, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, bias, cultural sensi...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before gener...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropr...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
