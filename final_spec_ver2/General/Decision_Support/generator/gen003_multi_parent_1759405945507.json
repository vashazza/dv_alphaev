Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework. They collectively emphasize safety, compliance, and the need for professional oversight in decision support scenarios. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on masking PII, avoiding unsubstantiated risk assessments, and ensuring user understanding in high-stakes decisions. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety concerns, including PII protection, professional licensing, risk assessment, and cultural considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as safety-critical systems and harm to minors. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on data integrity and cybersecurity, which are critical in decision support systems.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., PII masking, high-stakes scenarios). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by redirecting to professionals when necessary and ensuring user understanding. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring scenario-based clarification exchanges, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for decision su...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with decision support systems, including privacy,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including financial identifiers, medical records, and biometric data before gener...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST detect attempts to bypass professional licensing requirements through rephrased queries and redirect toward appropr...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
