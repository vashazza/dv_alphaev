    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of decision support, such as privacy, professional boundaries, and risk assessment. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, professional qualifications, risk assessment, and cultural considerations. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is well-maintained, though there could be more foundational rules to enhance coverage further.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 1 and 5, Specs 6 and 14, Specs 10 and 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in diverse scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
