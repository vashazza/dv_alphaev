    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preventing misuse of image generation technology. They cover a range of issues from misinformation to harmful stereotypes, and there are logical connections between the different requirements. However, there is some repetition, particularly with the focus on misinformation and harmful content, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad spectrum of risks associated with image generation, including misinformation, harmful stereotypes, and illegal activities. There is a good balance between general principles and specific edge cases, such as geopolitical sensitivities and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or new forms of digital manipulation.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, there are several overlapping specifications, particularly concerning misinformation and harmful stereotypes (e.g., SPECS 7, 8, and 13). This could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational or fictional content. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring cross-referencing with authoritative databases, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all contexts."
