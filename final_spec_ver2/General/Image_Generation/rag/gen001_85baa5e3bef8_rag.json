    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for image generation safety and compliance. They address various aspects of content generation, such as misinformation, privacy, and legality, and there are logical connections between them. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly disrupts cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including harmful stereotypes, misinformation, privacy, and legality. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, though some areas, like ethical representation and cultural sensitivity, could be more explicitly covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 4 and SPEC 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests to safer alternatives. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, which could complicate implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
