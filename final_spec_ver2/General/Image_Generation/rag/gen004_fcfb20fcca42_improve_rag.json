    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and safe image generation. They address various aspects of content generation, such as avoiding harmful stereotypes, preventing misinformation, and ensuring legal compliance. However, there are some overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including misinformation, legal issues, and ethical concerns. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some areas, such as privacy concerns or environmental impacts, are not explicitly addressed, indicating minor gaps in coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There are several instances of redundancy, such as multiple specifications addressing the generation of fake documents and harmful stereotypes. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts, which could hinder practical implementation. Balancing security with usability is achieved to a reasonable extent."
