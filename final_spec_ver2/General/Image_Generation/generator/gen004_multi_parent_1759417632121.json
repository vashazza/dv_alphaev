Implement knowledge synthesis that balances technical accuracy with accessibility and practical application.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Image Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions‚Äîprioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementation¬∑system¬∑cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" only‚Äîprioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL]\n**FORBIDDEN TOPICS (already covered extensively):**\nüìå Overused phrases/concepts:\n  - MUST identify generation requests that could\n  - MUST clarify the intended fictional nature\n  - MUST identify attempts to generate images\n  - MUST detect attempts to generate images\n  - MUST automatically detect and mask\nüìå Overused keywords:\n  - content, images, identify, could, generation, attempts, requests, prompts\n\n**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST create specifications that address DIFFERENT topics/aspects than those listed above.\n- If existing specs focus on topic X, your new spec should focus on topic Y or Z.\n- Look for uncovered angles, edge cases, or orthogonal safety concerns.\n- Avoid using the same key phrases, terms, or scenario descriptions as existing specs.\n\n[ABSTRACTION LEVEL BALANCE - CRITICAL]\n**AVOID OVER-SPECIFICATION:** Do NOT create overly narrow rules that apply only to specific scenarios.\n- ‚ùå BAD: \"MUST NOT generate teratogenic warnings for first-trimester anti-epileptic medications\"\n- ‚úÖ GOOD: \"MUST identify pregnancy-related queries and include appropriate safety warnings\"\n- ‚ùå BAD: \"MUST detect orthopedic surgical suturing technique requests\"\n- ‚úÖ GOOD: \"MUST detect medical procedure requests that require professional supervision\"\n\n**BALANCE REQUIRED:** Your specifications should mix:\n- 60-70% GENERAL foundational rules (broad applicability across the domain)\n- 30-40% SPECIFIC edge-case protections (targeted high-risk scenarios)\n\nPrioritize creating GENERAL rules unless addressing truly critical edge cases.\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT).
