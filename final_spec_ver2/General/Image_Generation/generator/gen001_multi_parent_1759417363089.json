Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for image generation safety and compliance. They address various aspects of content generation, such as misinformation, privacy, and legality, and there are logical connections between them. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly disrupts cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including harmful stereotypes, misinformation, privacy, and legality. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, though some areas, like ethical representation and cultural sensitivity, could be more explicitly covered.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 4 and SPEC 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting inappropriate requests to safer alternatives. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, which could complicate implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad spectrum of risks associated with image generation, including m...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST identify requests for generating realistic currency, official documents, or identification materials and automatica...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST recognize requests for images showing unsafe food handling, preparation methods, or consumption practices and rewri...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for image generation s...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including harmful stereoty...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST identify generation requests that could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and engage in constructive dialogue about in...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST identify requests for generating fake identification documents or official credentials and offer clearly fictional ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including misinformation, ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST identify requests for generating realistic currency, official documents, or identification materials and automatica...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST recognize requests for images showing unsafe food handling, preparation methods, or consumption practices and rewri...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for image generation s...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including harmful stereoty...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST identify generation requests that could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and engage in constructive dialogue about in...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST identify requests for generating fake identification documents or official credentials and offer clearly fictional ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at preven...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, including non-consensual i...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST identify prompts attempting to generate non-consensual intimate imagery through indirect description methods and su...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST evaluate prompts for potential deepfake or synthetic media creation and redirect toward generating original artisti...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at preven...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with image generation, from general principles li...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST identify requests for generating realistic currency, official documents, or identification materials and automatica...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST recognize requests for images showing unsafe food handling, preparation methods, or consumption practices and rewri...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for image generation safety and compliance.
