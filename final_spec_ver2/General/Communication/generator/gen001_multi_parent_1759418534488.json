Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that addresses various aspects of communication safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of risk, such as factual accuracy, ethical boundaries, and user intent. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 16 and SPEC 2), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of communication risks, including factual accuracy, ethical considerations, and user intent. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling minors and cultural competency. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies and digital privacy concerns, which could enhance the coverage..

They complement each other by covering different facets of risk, such as factual accuracy, ethical boundaries, and user intent. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 16 and SPEC 2), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of communication risks, including factual accuracy, ethical considerations, and user intent. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling minors and cultural competency. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies and digital privacy concerns, which could enhance the coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping rules (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 16 and SPEC 2). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific and may not be practical in all scenarios (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 19). More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) MUST identify potential liability-creating statements in professional contexts and rephrase using ed...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST NOT generate responses to ambiguous queries without first seeking clarification through targete...\n  - [3] (Score: 63) MUST identify when translation or communication tasks involve potential copyright infringement of cr...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
