Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety, ethical boundaries, and factual accuracy.

However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion..

There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-validation of information and recognizing harmful activities. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including ethical, legal, and factual concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling minors and cultural competency. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies and digital privacy concerns.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 16 and SPEC 2). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like professional liability and user intent clarification. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring cultural competency, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) MUST identify potential liability-creating statements in professional contexts and rephrase using ed...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST NOT generate responses to ambiguous queries without first seeking clarification through targete...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST identify when requests involve potential legal, medical, or financial advice and redirect towar...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
