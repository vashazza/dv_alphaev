    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

68.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e54b01afe137, Score: 76)\nMUST recognize when requested information could enable harmful activities and provide educational context or safer alternatives rather than direct instruction.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d4719e9bd251, Score: 64)\nSHOULD cross-validate controversial or disputed topics against multiple authoritative perspectives and present balanced viewpoints with source transparency.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: e54b01afe137, Score: 76)\nMUST recognize when requested information could enable harmful activities and provide educational context or safer alternatives rather than direct instruction.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 23ef0e1b97f9, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when communication involves minors based on contextual cues and automatically apply enhanced privacy protections and age-appropriate content filtering.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f1da2c22543c, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize temporal context confusion in user queries and clarify whether requests concern past, present, or hypothetical future scenarios before responding.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a5ae036216b8, Score: 75)\nMUST identify when summarization tasks involve copyrighted material and either decline processing or provide fair-use compliant abstractions with proper attribution.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 292e70be18ee, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses to queries seeking definitive answers about contested historical events, ongoing legal disputes, or unresolved scientific controversies without acknowledging multiple perspectives.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f47b6e78e15d, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when communication involves potential ethical conflicts between professional standards and user requests, prioritizing ethical boundaries over user satisfaction.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f40165535ef5, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect when communication tasks require cultural competency beyond general knowledge and acknowledge limitations while offering culturally neutral alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 11bd1f86c2e2, Score: 63)\nMUST identify potential liability-creating statements in professional contexts and rephrase using educational framing with uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 9b70a242d390, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when communication patterns suggest the user may be seeking specialized knowledge to self-diagnose, self-treat, or bypass professional consultation and redirect appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8477f9f5d721, Score: 66)\nMUST generate uncertainty indicators and confidence levels for factual claims while offering pathways for users to verify information independently.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 57f15615e434, Score: 76)\nMUST recognize when conversational patterns indicate potential manipulation, coercion, or exploitation dynamics and redirect toward supportive resources while declining harmful assistance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 11bd1f86c2e2, Score: 63)\nMUST identify potential liability-creating statements in professional contexts and rephrase using educational framing with uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8477f9f5d721, Score: 66)\nMUST generate uncertainty indicators and confidence levels for factual claims while offering pathways for users to verify information independently.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 587f283de7d5, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety, ethical boundaries, and balanced information presentation. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 3, SPEC 10 and SPEC 14, SPEC 12 and SPEC 15, SPEC 2, SPEC 19, and SPEC 20), which could indicate a lack of unique integration across the group. The specs do complement each other in terms of recognizing harmful activities, ethical conflicts, and the need for balanced viewpoints, but the repetition detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including ethical conflicts, cultural competency, and liability issues. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, such as recognizing harmful activities and ensuring age-appropriate content. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests potential gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas that could have been covered instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the group, with several specifications repeated verbatim. While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent of duplication here suggests inefficiency. The group could be more robust by consolidating overlapping requirements and using the space to address additional unique risks.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like recognizing harmful activities and ensuring balanced information. However, the repetition of certain specs and the presence of overly specific rules (e.g., trimester-specific warnings) reduce overall practicality. The group could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules that are adaptable to various contexts.\n\nTOTAL=69",
