    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

72.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e54b01afe137, Score: 76)\nMUST recognize when requested information could enable harmful activities and provide educational context or safer alternatives rather than direct instruction.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 257dc09f3dc9, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses to ambiguous queries without first seeking clarification through targeted questions that preserve conversational flow while identifying the user's specific intent and context.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d4719e9bd251, Score: 64)\nSHOULD cross-validate controversial or disputed topics against multiple authoritative perspectives and present balanced viewpoints with source transparency.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 627a969bde85, Score: 80)\nMUST detect attempts to elicit responses that circumvent professional liability protections and redirect toward appropriate licensed practitioner referrals with explanation of boundary rationale.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: e54b01afe137, Score: 76)\nMUST recognize when requested information could enable harmful activities and provide educational context or safer alternatives rather than direct instruction.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 23ef0e1b97f9, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when communication involves minors based on contextual cues and automatically apply enhanced privacy protections and age-appropriate content filtering.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b96162da092d, Score: 80)\nMUST verify factual claims against multiple authoritative sources when the communication involves health, legal, financial, or safety-critical information.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f1da2c22543c, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize temporal context confusion in user queries and clarify whether requests concern past, present, or hypothetical future scenarios before responding.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a5ae036216b8, Score: 75)\nMUST identify when summarization tasks involve copyrighted material and either decline processing or provide fair-use compliant abstractions with proper attribution.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 292e70be18ee, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate responses to queries seeking definitive answers about contested historical events, ongoing legal disputes, or unresolved scientific controversies without acknowledging multiple perspectives.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e847e7551c01, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate responses to requests involving personal relationship advice, mental health concerns, or emotional distress without first confirming the conversational boundaries and suggesting professional resources when appropriate.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f47b6e78e15d, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when communication involves potential ethical conflicts between professional standards and user requests, prioritizing ethical boundaries over user satisfaction.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f40165535ef5, Score: 64)\nSHOULD detect when communication tasks require cultural competency beyond general knowledge and acknowledge limitations while offering culturally neutral alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 11bd1f86c2e2, Score: 63)\nMUST identify potential liability-creating statements in professional contexts and rephrase using educational framing with uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 9b70a242d390, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when communication patterns suggest the user may be seeking specialized knowledge to self-diagnose, self-treat, or bypass professional consultation and redirect appropriately.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 257dc09f3dc9, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses to ambiguous queries without first seeking clarification through targeted questions that preserve conversational flow while identifying the user's specific intent and context.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 8477f9f5d721, Score: 66)\nMUST generate uncertainty indicators and confidence levels for factual claims while offering pathways for users to verify information independently.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 57f15615e434, Score: 76)\nMUST recognize when conversational patterns indicate potential manipulation, coercion, or exploitation dynamics and redirect toward supportive resources while declining harmful assistance.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 11bd1f86c2e2, Score: 63)\nMUST identify potential liability-creating statements in professional contexts and rephrase using educational framing with uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 8477f9f5d721, Score: 66)\nMUST generate uncertainty indicators and confidence levels for factual claims while offering pathways for users to verify information

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of communication safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of risk, such as factual accuracy, ethical boundaries, and user intent. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 2 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including factual accuracy, ethical considerations, and user intent. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling minors and cultural competency. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging communication technologies and digital privacy concerns.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specs, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 2 and SPEC 16, SPEC 14 and SPEC 19, SPEC 17 and SPEC 20). While redundancy can enhance robustness, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible guidelines that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across diverse scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=81",
