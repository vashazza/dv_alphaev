    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on communication integrity, cultural sensitivity, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 10 and SPEC 7) that suggest a lack of integration and coordination. The logical connections between different requirements are present but could be more explicitly defined to enhance cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of communication-related risks, including cultural competency, ethical conflicts, and temporal accuracy. However, there is a tendency towards specificity in certain areas, such as cultural sensitivity and temporal context, without enough general principles to provide a foundational framework. Some critical areas, like data security and user privacy, could be more comprehensively addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with several specs being repeated (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 10 and SPEC 7, SPEC 13 and SPEC 12, SPEC 20 and SPEC 19). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world communication scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those dealing with cultural nuances and temporal contexts, which may limit their applicability across diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability.\n\nTOTAL=69",
