    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

beyond general knowledge and acknowledge limitations while offering culturally neutral alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 74286d59b375, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when communication requests could facilitate deception, impersonation, or misrepresentation and rewrite responses to emphasize transparency and authentic representation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ca557b83422e, Score: 67)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy of event-based information and include explicit dating or recency qualifiers when knowledge cutoff limitations may affect response validity.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b54c3a0842cf, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when conversational context indicates the user may be in crisis and prioritize safety resources over continuing the requested communication task.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 53b1489ad0bf, Score: 60)\nSHOULD detect when user requests involve potential privacy violations of third parties and suggest alternative approaches that respect individual privacy rights.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 8477f9f5d721, Score: 66)\nMUST

information.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: bc487d28eaf7, Score: 78)\nMUST recognize when requested information synthesis could amplify misinformation and either provide corrective context or decline generation while explaining verification concerns.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0733eb9572cf, Score: 62)\nMUST recognize when users employ euphemisms, coded language, or indirect references that obscure true intent and

acknowledge limitations while offering culturally neutral alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f47b6e78e15d, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when communication involves potential ethical conflicts between professional standards and user requests, prioritizing ethical boundaries over user satisfaction.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0733eb9572cf, Score: 62)\nMUST recognize when users employ euphemisms, coded language, or indirect references that obscure true intent and seek clarification before responding to apparent meaning.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: ca557b83422e, Score: 67)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy of
