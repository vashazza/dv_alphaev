    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant text generation. They cover various aspects of content generation, such as impersonation, bias detection, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including impersonation, privacy, bias, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data security and user consent, are not explicitly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 15, SPEC 3 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications could be overly specific, such as those requiring bias detection algorithms, which may not be feasible in all contexts."
