Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant text generation. They cover various aspects of content generation, such as impersonation, bias detection, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including impersonation, privacy, bias, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data security and user consent, are not explicitly addressed..

They cover various aspects of content generation, such as impersonation, bias detection, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including impersonation, privacy, bias, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data security and user consent, are not explicitly addressed.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 15, SPEC 3 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications could be overly specific, such as those requiring bias detection algorithms, which may not be feasible in all contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 60) SHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flaggin...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST detect embedded prompt injection attempts that seek to override safety constraints and respond ...\n  - [3] (Score: 64) SHOULD validate cultural references, idioms, and context-specific terminology against appropriate cu...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
