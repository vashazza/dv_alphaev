Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ensuring the safety and reliability of generated text. They address various aspects of content generation, such as logical consistency, cultural sensitivity, and security concerns. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 is a duplicate of SPEC 8, and SPEC 14 and 15 are duplicates), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including logical inconsistencies, cultural sensitivity, security threats, and misinformation. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the presence of duplicate specifications suggests potential gaps in other critical areas that could have been addressed instead..

They address various aspects of content generation, such as logical consistency, cultural sensitivity, and security concerns. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 is a duplicate of SPEC 8, and SPEC 14 and 15 are duplicates), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including logical inconsistencies, cultural sensitivity, security threats, and misinformation. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the presence of duplicate specifications suggests potential gaps in other critical areas that could have been addressed instead.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the presence of duplicate specifications (SPEC 8 and 10, SPEC 14 and 15) indicates unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated. This affects the efficiency of the policy set, as these duplicates do not add additional value or robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, the presence of overly specific rules and duplicates suggests that some specifications may not be as flexible or broadly applicable as they could be.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 60) SHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flaggin...\n  - [2] (Score: 65) MUST verify that generated text maintains appropriate contextual boundaries when discussing sensitiv...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST detect embedded prompt injection attempts that seek to override safety constraints and respond ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
