    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 65.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 64fbda6cedb5, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content mimicking official communications from government agencies, institutions, or organizations without clear fictional context markers and impersonation warnings.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f98c107cb587, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers in generated text while preserving contextual meaning through generic placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 2be221f76d0e, Score: 61)\nMUST recognize requests for content that could enable harassment campaigns or coordinated inauthentic behavior and offer constructive alternatives focused on legitimate communication goals.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 43c8c18d4ccb, Score: 73)\nMUST identify ambiguous pronouns, unclear referents, or missing context dependencies in user queries and generate targeted clarification questions before producing substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0b0248cc53f4, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasings that acknowledge correlation versus causation distinctions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 0eaa16f354e2, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as official guidance in legal, medical, or financial contexts without prominent advisory boundaries and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7d2dba23de2e, Score: N/A)\nSHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flagging anachronisms or chronological inconsistencies with corrective annotations while preserving narrative flow.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 02c514091c13, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could be weaponized for social engineering, phishing, or deceptive communication without clear educational framing and warnings.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0eaa16f354e2, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as official guidance in legal, medical, or financial contexts without prominent advisory boundaries and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 60703ad01cd9, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate cultural references, idioms, and context-specific terminology against appropriate cultural knowledge bases to prevent misrepresentation or stereotyping of communities and traditions.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8ad55c6fa6da, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when generated text contains logical inconsistencies, contradictory statements, or unsupported causal claims and either resolve conflicts or flag uncertainty areas.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d37ff7e61dab, Score: 64)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy by flagging outdated references and providing knowledge cutoff disclaimers for time-sensitive information.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 64fbda6cedb5, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content mimicking official communications from government agencies, institutions, or organizations without clear fictional context markers and impersonation warnings.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring safe and compliant text generation. They cover various aspects of content generation, such as impersonation, bias, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 10, SPEC 1 and SPEC 15, SPEC 3 and SPEC 13), which could indicate a lack of coordination in the policy set.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including impersonation, privacy, bias, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling sensitive topics like mental health or political content, which could be critical in certain contexts.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 10, SPEC 1 and SPEC 15, SPEC 3 and SPEC 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines that are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific or repetitive, which could complicate implementation and maintenance. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=75",
