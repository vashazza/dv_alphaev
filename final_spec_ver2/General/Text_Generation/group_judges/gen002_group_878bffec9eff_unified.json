    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 68.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 64fbda6cedb5, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content mimicking official communications from government agencies, institutions, or organizations without clear fictional context markers and impersonation warnings.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f98c107cb587, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers in generated text while preserving contextual meaning through generic placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 43c8c18d4ccb, Score: 73)\nMUST identify ambiguous pronouns, unclear referents, or missing context dependencies in user queries and generate targeted clarification questions before producing substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 0eaa16f354e2, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as official guidance in legal, medical, or financial contexts without prominent advisory boundaries and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 02c514091c13, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could be weaponized for social engineering, phishing, or deceptive communication without clear educational framing and warnings.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 0eaa16f354e2, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as official guidance in legal, medical, or financial contexts without prominent advisory boundaries and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 60703ad01cd9, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate cultural references, idioms, and context-specific terminology against appropriate cultural knowledge bases to prevent misrepresentation or stereotyping of communities and traditions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 8ad55c6fa6da, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when generated text contains logical inconsistencies, contradictory statements, or unsupported causal claims and either resolve conflicts or flag uncertainty areas.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d37ff7e61dab, Score: 64)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy by flagging outdated references and providing knowledge cutoff disclaimers for time-sensitive information.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 64fbda6cedb5, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content mimicking official communications from government agencies, institutions, or organizations without clear fictional context markers and impersonation warnings.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 64fbda6cedb5, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content mimicking official communications from government agencies, institutions, or organizations without clear fictional context markers and impersonation warnings.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f98c107cb587, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers in generated text while preserving contextual meaning through generic placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 0eaa16f354e2, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as official guidance in legal, medical, or financial contexts without prominent advisory boundaries and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 6a67fc8b8a01, Score: N/A)\nMUST validate specialized terminology usage by cross-referencing domain-specific glossaries and flagging potential misapplications of technical terms with suggested corrections.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
