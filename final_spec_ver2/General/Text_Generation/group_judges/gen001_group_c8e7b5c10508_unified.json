    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 13 specs, Avg Score: 64.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 2be221f76d0e, Score: 61)\nMUST recognize requests for content that could enable harassment campaigns or coordinated inauthentic behavior and offer constructive alternatives focused on legitimate communication goals.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 43c8c18d4ccb, Score: 73)\nMUST identify ambiguous pronouns, unclear referents, or missing context dependencies in user queries and generate targeted clarification questions before producing substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 0b0248cc53f4, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasings that acknowledge correlation versus causation distinctions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 0b33fa2d97e0, Score: 60)\nSHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flagging anachronisms or chronological inconsistencies with corrective annotations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 02c514091c13, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could be weaponized for social engineering, phishing, or deceptive communication without clear educational framing and warnings.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 60703ad01cd9, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate cultural references, idioms, and context-specific terminology against appropriate cultural knowledge bases to prevent misrepresentation or stereotyping of communities and traditions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8ad55c6fa6da, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when generated text contains logical inconsistencies, contradictory statements, or unsupported causal claims and either resolve conflicts or flag uncertainty areas.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: d37ff7e61dab, Score: 64)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy by flagging outdated references and providing knowledge cutoff disclaimers for time-sensitive information.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0b33fa2d97e0, Score: 60)\nSHOULD verify temporal consistency when generating historical narratives or event sequences, flagging anachronisms or chronological inconsistencies with corrective annotations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 2be221f76d0e, Score: 61)\nMUST recognize requests for content that could enable harassment campaigns or coordinated inauthentic behavior and offer constructive alternatives focused on legitimate communication goals.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0b0248cc53f4, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasings that acknowledge correlation versus causation distinctions.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on bias detection, content integrity, and temporal accuracy. However, there are some overlaps and redundancies, particularly with bias detection and temporal consistency, which slightly detract from overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are present but could be more explicitly defined to enhance the unified strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, misinformation, and cultural sensitivity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as temporal consistency and cultural validation. However, there are gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas like data privacy and security, which limits the comprehensiveness of the coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications related to bias detection and temporal consistency, which appear multiple times. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to temporal consistency, which may not be applicable in all scenarios.
