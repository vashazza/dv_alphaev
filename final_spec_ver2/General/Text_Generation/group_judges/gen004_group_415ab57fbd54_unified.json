    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 12 specs, Avg Score: 69.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 43c8c18d4ccb, Score: 73)\nMUST identify ambiguous pronouns, unclear referents, or missing context dependencies in user queries and generate targeted clarification questions before producing substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0b0248cc53f4, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasings that acknowledge correlation versus causation distinctions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 02c514091c13, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could be weaponized for social engineering, phishing, or deceptive communication without clear educational framing and warnings.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 60703ad01cd9, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate cultural references, idioms, and context-specific terminology against appropriate cultural knowledge bases to prevent misrepresentation or stereotyping of communities and traditions.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 8ad55c6fa6da, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when generated text contains logical inconsistencies, contradictory statements, or unsupported causal claims and either resolve conflicts or flag uncertainty areas.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a238446641ad, Score: 68)\nMUST apply bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate discriminatory language patterns before finalizing text output.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d37ff7e61dab, Score: 64)\nMUST verify temporal accuracy by flagging outdated references and providing knowledge cutoff disclaimers for time-sensitive information.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 0b0248cc53f4, Score: 64)\nMUST automatically identify and rewrite content containing unsubstantiated causal claims, presenting alternative phrasings that acknowledge correlation versus causation distinctions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: cd62dddd53b5, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, passport details, financial account numbers, and biometric identifiers in generated text while preserving analytical context through anonymized placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0eaa16f354e2, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as official guidance in legal, medical, or financial contexts without prominent advisory boundaries and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 9c298d422969, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce text that mimics emergency communications, official notifications, or urgent alerts without prominent simulation labels and context-appropriate disclaimers.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring the safety and reliability of text generation. They cover various aspects such as bias detection, ambiguity resolution, and protection against misuse. However, there is some repetition, particularly with bias detection (Specs 1 and 7), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with text generation, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and misuse. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, some areas, such as ethical considerations beyond bias and misinformation, could be more comprehensively addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, notably with Specs 1 and 7, and Specs 3 and 9, which address similar issues. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring cultural validation, which may be challenging to implement across diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=79",
