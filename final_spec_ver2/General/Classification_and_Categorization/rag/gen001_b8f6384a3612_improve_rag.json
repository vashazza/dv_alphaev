    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classification and avoiding bias. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of classification, such as avoiding stereotypes, ensuring evidence-based decisions, and recognizing limitations. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safe and compliant classification.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including bias, misinformation, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling self-harm indicators and outdated classification systems. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging risks or technological advancements in classification.",
    "redundancy": "The specifications avoid unnecessary duplication and maintain robustness by addressing different facets of classification. While there is some overlap in addressing bias and stereotypes, it is appropriate for reinforcing critical safety areas. The group efficiently consolidates requirements without excessive redundancy.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are flexible and adaptable to different contexts, covering multiple use cases. However, some specifications may be challenging to implement due to the need for advanced detection mechanisms and expert validation, which could impact practicality."
