    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes caution in classification tasks, especially in sensitive areas. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of classification, such as ambiguity, bias, and cultural sensitivity. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including legal, cultural, and demographic considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as ambiguous terminology and dual-use scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and their classification challenges.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing ambiguous terminology (e.g., SPECS 7, 9, and 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by recommending professional consultation and alternative approaches. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability across different contexts."
