    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classification and avoiding bias. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of classification, such as avoiding stereotypes, ensuring evidence-based decisions, and recognizing limitations. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safe and compliant classification.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including bias, misinformation, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as legal and medical content. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential classification scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "The specifications avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. There is some overlap in addressing bias and stereotypes, but this redundancy is appropriate given the critical nature of these issues. The group efficiently consolidates requirements without excessive repetition.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, and there is a slight tendency toward specificity in certain areas, which could impact real-world implementation."
