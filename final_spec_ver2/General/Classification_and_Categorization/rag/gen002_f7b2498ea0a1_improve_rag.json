    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classification and categorization. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of bias, misinformation, and the need for evidence-based decisions. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of issues related to classification and categorization, including bias, misinformation, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and self-harm indicators. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "The specifications avoid unnecessary duplication and maintain robustness. While there is some overlap in addressing bias and stereotypes, it is appropriate given the critical nature of these issues. The group efficiently consolidates requirements without excessive redundancy.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, and there is a slight tendency towards specificity in certain areas."
