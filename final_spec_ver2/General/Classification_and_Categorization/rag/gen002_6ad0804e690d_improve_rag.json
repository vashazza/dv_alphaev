    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safety, privacy, and ethical considerations. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on protecting minors and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of classifications. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4) and overlapping areas that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, safety, and ethical considerations, with a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. The specifications address various domains like minors, legal, medical, and cultural content, ensuring comprehensive coverage. However, there could be more foundational rules to balance the specific edge-case protections.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 9 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While appropriate redundancy exists for critical safety areas, the presence of identical or very similar specifications suggests room for improvement in reducing overlap without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Streamlining these to be more flexible could enhance practicality."
