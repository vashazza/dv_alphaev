    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classification and avoiding bias. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of classification, such as avoiding stereotypes, ensuring evidence-based decisions, and acknowledging limitations. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safe and compliant classification.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, from bias and stereotypes to misinformation and outdated systems. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling self-harm indicators and legal/medical content. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some overlap in addressing bias and stereotypes, the redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. The specifications avoid unnecessary duplication and maintain robustness by focusing on different facets of classification ethics and safety.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are flexible and broadly applicable, covering multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more adaptable to different contexts, and there is a slight tendency towards specificity in certain areas."
