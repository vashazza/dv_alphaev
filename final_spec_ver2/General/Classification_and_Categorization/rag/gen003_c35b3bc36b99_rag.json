    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, focusing on ethical and safe classification practices. They emphasize avoiding harm, respecting cultural contexts, and ensuring clarity in classification. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 7 and SPEC 10, SPEC 3 and SPEC 11, SPEC 8 and SPEC 14, SPEC 1 and SPEC 15), which slightly disrupts the cohesion by introducing redundancy rather than complementary diversity.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of important issues in classification, such as bias, ambiguity, cultural sensitivity, and dual-use scenarios. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, like ambiguous terminology and outdated classification systems. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns, which are critical in modern classification tasks.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy with several specifications being repeated verbatim. This indicates inefficiency in the policy set, as these could be consolidated to streamline the framework. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here is excessive and detracts from the overall efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability by addressing ambiguity, bias, and cultural sensitivity. They are adaptable to various contexts, but the repeated specifications suggest a lack of flexibility in addressing unique scenarios. The presence of overly specific rules is minimal, which aids in maintaining practicality."
