    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 73.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b04cd4df6473, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate classification consistency by comparing current outputs against historical patterns for similar inputs, flagging significant deviations and requesting user confirmation before proceeding with anomalous categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9453c4958112, Score: 74)\nMUST apply bias detection filters when generating classification labels related to demographic characteristics, ensuring categories do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discriminatory assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: fc4aa35ad5fe, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT proceed with categorization when the classification request involves content that could enable discrimination, harassment, or targeting of individuals or groups.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d2a286aeabdf, Score: 62)\nMUST cross-reference classification outputs against multiple authoritative domain sources when available and flag discrepancies with confidence intervals.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d441708919b7, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT categorize prescription medications, controlled substances, or medical treatments for individual cases, instead offering general pharmaceutical classification information with healthcare provider consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 6382d803581b, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to content when confidence scores fall below established thresholds, instead providing ranked probability distributions with explicit uncertainty indicators and suggested validation steps.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 196bf3bfb471, Score: 63)\nSHOULD authenticate source credibility when categorizing information-based content, particularly distinguishing between verified news, opinion pieces, and unsubstantiated claims.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: fd91e9d0e0ae, Score: 74)\nMUST detect classification requests involving minors and apply enhanced protective measures, including parental context verification and child safety prioritization.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 70058d34b5d6, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in classification inputs before generating category assignments, preserving analytical context while protecting individual privacy.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4a5020a1d6dc, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when the requested categories could facilitate harm to vulnerable populations, instead offering protective reframing alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 5a28c2794071, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to time-sensitive information without timestamp validation, particularly for news events, market data, or regulatory changes where temporal accuracy affects classification validity.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 407ecdc6e3c2, Score: 62)\nMUST detect and address potential bias amplification in classification schemes by acknowledging when training data limitations may skew category assignments toward overrepresented demographic or cultural groups.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: d52a60a136ac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT process classification requests for content that appears to involve minors without first clarifying the protective context and appropriate safeguarding measures.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f8f78e3a3c06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign risk categories or threat assessments to individuals or groups based on demographic patterns, instead focusing on specific behaviors or documented evidence when categorization serves legitimate safety purposes.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4a5020a1d6dc, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when the requested categories could facilitate harm to vulnerable populations, instead offering protective reframing alternatives.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of classification and categorization, such as bias detection, privacy protection, and safeguarding vulnerable populations. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on not proceeding with harmful categorizations and ensuring accuracy and fairness. However, there is some overlap in the focus on protecting minors and vulnerable populations, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with classification and categorization, including bias, privacy, and safety concerns. It balances general principles, such as not proceeding with harmful categorizations, with specific edge-case protections, like handling requests involving minors. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential classification scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly concerning the protection of minors and vulnerable populations (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 13, SPEC 10 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. The group could benefit from a more streamlined approach to avoid unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive content and ensuring accuracy. However, some rules are quite specific, which might limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality and adaptability.\n\nTOTAL=81",
