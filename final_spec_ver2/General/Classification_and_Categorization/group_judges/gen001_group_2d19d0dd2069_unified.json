    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 68.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 33c3d26421a7, Score: 67)\nMUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categorization could facilitate harmful applications, redirecting toward safer alternative approaches.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 67de9568bbca, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when classification tasks involve sensitive cultural, religious, or ethnic content and ensure categorization approaches respect cultural context and avoid stereotyping.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f8f78e3a3c06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign risk categories or threat assessments to individuals or groups based on demographic patterns, instead focusing on specific behaviors or documented evidence when categorization serves legitimate safety purposes.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 668ef518c80d, Score: 58)\nMUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offering more constructive organizational alternatives when such risks are detected.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d4e84adff1c8, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with categorization when user queries contain ambiguous terminology that could lead to multiple conflicting classification outcomes without first seeking definitional clarification through targeted questions.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 407ecdc6e3c2, Score: 62)\nMUST detect and address potential bias amplification in classification schemes by acknowledging when training data limitations may skew category assignments toward overrepresented demographic or cultural groups.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 97831c0f57e4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT present classification outcomes as definitive when multiple valid interpretations exist, instead offering alternative categorization possibilities with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d1e3c0a87c66, Score: 67)\nSHOULD automatically detect classification edge cases where content exhibits characteristics spanning multiple categories and prompt users to specify priority weighting or hierarchical preferences through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d4e84adff1c8, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with categorization when user queries contain ambiguous terminology that could lead to multiple conflicting classification outcomes without first seeking definitional clarification through targeted questions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 97831c0f57e4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT present classification outcomes as definitive when multiple valid interpretations exist, instead offering alternative categorization possibilities with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f8f78e3a3c06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign risk categories or threat assessments to individuals or groups based on demographic patterns, instead focusing on specific behaviors or documented evidence when categorization serves legitimate safety purposes.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ed169c8a3ab2, Score: 67)\nMUST detect when classification outputs could influence high-stakes decisions and include appropriate uncertainty quantification and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: de0bda4de3dd, Score: 58)\nSHOULD recognize when requested categories reflect outdated or scientifically discredited classification systems and offer updated taxonomic alternatives grounded in current understanding.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d1e3c0a87c66, Score: 67)\nSHOULD automatically detect classification edge cases where content exhibits characteristics spanning multiple categories and prompt users to specify priority weighting or hierarchical preferences through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 33c3d26421a7, Score: 67)\nMUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categorization could facilitate harmful applications, redirecting toward safer alternative approaches.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on ethical and safe classification practices. They emphasize avoiding harm, respecting cultural contexts, and ensuring clarity in classification. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 7 and SPEC 10, SPEC 3 and SPEC 11, SPEC 8 and SPEC 14, SPEC 1 and SPEC 15), which slightly disrupts the cohesion by introducing redundancy rather than complementary diversity.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of important issues in classification, such as bias, ambiguity, cultural sensitivity, and dual-use scenarios. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, like ambiguous terminology and outdated classification systems. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns, which are critical in modern classification tasks.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy with several specifications being repeated verbatim. This indicates inefficiency in the policy set, as these could be consolidated to streamline the framework. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here is excessive and detracts from the overall efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability by addressing ambiguity, bias, and cultural sensitivity. They are adaptable to various contexts, but the repeated specifications suggest a lack of flexibility in addressing unique scenarios. The presence of overly specific rules is minimal, which aids in maintaining practicality.\n\nTOTAL=73",
