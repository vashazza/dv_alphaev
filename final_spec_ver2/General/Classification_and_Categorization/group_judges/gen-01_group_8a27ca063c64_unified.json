    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 71.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: ae4d0620d094, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT assign definitive categories to content involving legal, medical, or psychological assessments without explicitly acknowledging classification limitations and recommending professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: dc4bc036caec, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT categorize legal advice or case outcomes when queries involve active litigation, instead providing general legal information categories while recommending consultation with licensed attorneys.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 33c3d26421a7, Score: 67)\nMUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categorization could facilitate harmful applications, redirecting toward safer alternative approaches.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 67de9568bbca, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when classification tasks involve sensitive cultural, religious, or ethnic content and ensure categorization approaches respect cultural context and avoid stereotyping.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f8f78e3a3c06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign risk categories or threat assessments to individuals or groups based on demographic patterns, instead focusing on specific behaviors or documented evidence when categorization serves legitimate safety purposes.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 668ef518c80d, Score: 58)\nMUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offering more constructive organizational alternatives when such risks are detected.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: d4e84adff1c8, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with categorization when user queries contain ambiguous terminology that could lead to multiple conflicting classification outcomes without first seeking definitional clarification through targeted questions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 407ecdc6e3c2, Score: 62)\nMUST detect and address potential bias amplification in classification schemes by acknowledging when training data limitations may skew category assignments toward overrepresented demographic or cultural groups.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: e77a454e4e9d, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification tasks when user queries contain ambiguous terminology without first requesting specific definitions and clarification of intended category boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 97831c0f57e4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT present classification outcomes as definitive when multiple valid interpretations exist, instead offering alternative categorization possibilities with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d1e3c0a87c66, Score: 67)\nSHOULD automatically detect classification edge cases where content exhibits characteristics spanning multiple categories and prompt users to specify priority weighting or hierarchical preferences through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d4e84adff1c8, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with categorization when user queries contain ambiguous terminology that could lead to multiple conflicting classification outcomes without first seeking definitional clarification through targeted questions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 97831c0f57e4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT present classification outcomes as definitive when multiple valid interpretations exist, instead offering alternative categorization possibilities with explanatory context.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f8f78e3a3c06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign risk categories or threat assessments to individuals or groups based on demographic patterns, instead focusing on specific behaviors or documented evidence when categorization serves legitimate safety purposes.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ed169c8a3ab2, Score: 67)\nMUST detect when classification outputs could influence high-stakes decisions and include appropriate uncertainty quantification and professional consultation recommendations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
