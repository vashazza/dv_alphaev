    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 64.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4dd5f01796b5, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT assign categories that rely on unsubstantiated correlations or stereotypical associations, instead requiring evidence-based justification for each classification decision.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 5ab6162dc8a9, Score: 62)\nMUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categorization approaches that avoid discriminatory labeling.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 407ecdc6e3c2, Score: 62)\nMUST detect and address potential bias amplification in classification schemes by acknowledging when training data limitations may skew category assignments toward overrepresented demographic or cultural groups.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b04cd4df6473, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate classification consistency by comparing current outputs against historical patterns for similar inputs, flagging significant deviations and requesting user confirmation before proceeding with anomalous categorizations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8048adf5cb2e, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT proceed with classification when user requests involve categorizing individuals based on protected characteristics or could enable discriminatory profiling.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 196bf3bfb471, Score: 63)\nSHOULD authenticate source credibility when categorizing information-based content, particularly distinguishing between verified news, opinion pieces, and unsubstantiated claims.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: de0bda4de3dd, Score: 58)\nSHOULD recognize when requested categories reflect outdated or scientifically discredited classification systems and offer updated taxonomic alternatives grounded in current understanding.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9ae6a95cfdff, Score: 70)\nMUST detect attempts to classify individuals or groups using harmful stereotypes and redirect toward constructive characteristic analysis that respects human dignity.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 55a33f563736, Score: 67)\nMUST NOT categorize content in ways that could facilitate the spread of misinformation, instead offering fact-based classification approaches that promote information literacy.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9453c4958112, Score: 74)\nMUST apply bias detection filters when generating classification labels related to demographic characteristics, ensuring categories do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discriminatory assumptions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 5fe0f4c0a05a, Score: 78)\nMUST recognize when classification requests exceed the assistant's domain expertise and provide category suggestions marked as preliminary pending expert validation rather than definitive assignments.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f8f78e3a3c06, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign risk categories or threat assessments to individuals or groups based on demographic patterns, instead focusing on specific behaviors or documented evidence when categorization serves legitimate safety purposes.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 5fe474fde84e, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, financial account details, and biometric identifiers before generating any categorization output.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: ff88d074876f, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT assign categories to content involving minors without additional privacy protections and consideration of potential long-term impacts on developing individuals.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 83964316d3a9, Score: 73)\nMUST verify classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources when categorizing content with potential legal, medical, or safety implications.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
