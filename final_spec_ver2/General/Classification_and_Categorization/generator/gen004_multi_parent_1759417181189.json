Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on responsible classification and categorization. They emphasize caution in sensitive areas such as legal, medical, and cultural contexts, and promote the use of professional consultation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as avoiding definitive categorizations and addressing ambiguity, which collectively contribute to a unified compliance strategy.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with classification tasks, including legal, cultural, and demographic considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling ambiguous terminology and bias amplification. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as technological or environmental factors, which could enhance the overall coverage..

They emphasize caution in sensitive areas such as legal, medical, and cultural contexts, and promote the use of professional consultation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as avoiding definitive categorizations and addressing ambiguity, which collectively contribute to a unified compliance strategy.\n• Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with classification tasks, including legal, cultural, and demographic considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling ambiguous terminology and bias amplification. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as technological or environmental factors, which could enhance the overall coverage.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated emphasis on handling ambiguous terminology (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 9). While this redundancy reinforces critical safety areas, it could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness without excessive duplication, but streamlining similar requirements could improve efficiency.\n• Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, promoting a balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and emphasize flexibility, such as offering alternative categorization possibilities. However, some specifications may be overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability in broader scenarios. Simplifying these could enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 58) MUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offerin...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST NOT proceed with categorization when user queries contain ambiguous terminology that could lead...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST NOT proceed with classification when the requested categories could facilitate harm to vulnerab...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
