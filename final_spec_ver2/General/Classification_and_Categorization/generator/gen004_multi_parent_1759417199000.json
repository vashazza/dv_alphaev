  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes caution in classification tasks, especially in sensitive areas. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of classification, such as ambiguity, bias, and cultural sensitivity. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including legal, cultural, and demographic considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as ambiguous terminology and dual-use scenarios. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and their classification challenges.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing ambiguous terminology (e.g., SPECS 7, 9, and 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by recommending professional consultation and alternative approaches. However, some rules are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classificat...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including bias, misinformation, and ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT assign categories that rely on unsubstantiated correlations or stereotypical associations, instead requiring ev...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 90/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical and evidenc...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including bias, misinformation, and ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT assign categories that rely on unsubstantiated correlations or stereotypical associations, instead requiring ev...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classificat...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including bias, misinformation, and ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT assign categories that rely on unsubstantiated correlations or stereotypical associations, instead requiring ev...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on ethical and safe classification practic...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important issues in classification, such as bias, ambiguity, cultu...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categorization could facilit...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST detect when classification tasks involve sensitive cultural, religious, or ethnic content and ensure categorization...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
