Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safety, privacy, and ethical considerations in classification tasks. There are logical connections between requirements, particularly concerning the protection of minors and sensitive content. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, safety, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling minors and sensitive content.

There are logical connections between requirements, particularly concerning the protection of minors and sensitive content. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, safety, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling minors and sensitive content. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential classification scenarios.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 12 and SPEC 14), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, the repetition here does not add robustness and instead suggests inefficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling sensitive content and protecting minors. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 58) SHOULD recognize when requested categories reflect outdated or scientifically discredited classifica...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST NOT proceed with classification when the requested categories could facilitate harm to vulnerab...\n  - [3] (Score: 58) MUST NOT apply classification schemes that could reinforce harmful social divisions, instead offerin...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
