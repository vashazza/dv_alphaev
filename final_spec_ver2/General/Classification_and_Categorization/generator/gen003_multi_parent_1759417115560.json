  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 73.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on ethical and safe classification practices. They emphasize avoiding harm, respecting cultural contexts, and ensuring clarity in classification. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 7 and SPEC 10, SPEC 3 and SPEC 11, SPEC 8 and SPEC 14, SPEC 1 and SPEC 15), which slightly disrupts the cohesion by introducing redundancy rather than complementary diversity.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important issues in classification, such as bias, ambiguity, cultural sensitivity, and dual-use scenarios. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, like ambiguous terminology and outdated classification systems. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns, which are critical in modern classification tasks.. Redundancy: There is significant redundancy with several specifications being repeated verbatim. This indicates inefficiency in the policy set, as these could be consolidated to streamline the framework. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here is excessive and detracts from the overall efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability by addressing ambiguity, bias, and cultural sensitivity. They are adaptable to various contexts, but the repeated specifications suggest a lack of flexibility in addressing unique scenarios. The presence of overly specific rules is minimal, which aids in maintaining practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 83/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classificat...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including bias, misinformation, and ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT assign categories that rely on unsubstantiated correlations or stereotypical associations, instead requiring ev...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 86/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classificat...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of issues related to classification and categorization, including bia...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT assign categories that rely on unsubstantiated correlations or stereotypical associations, instead requiring ev...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 86/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical classificat...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of classification-related risks, including bias, misinformation, and ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT assign categories that rely on unsubstantiated correlations or stereotypical associations, instead requiring ev...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 62): MUST redirect classification attempts involving harmful stereotypes toward constructive dialogue about alternative categ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on resp...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks associated with classification tasks, including le...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT assign definitive categories to content involving legal, medical, or psychological assessments without explicit...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT categorize legal advice or case outcomes when queries involve active litigation, instead providing general lega...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on protecting minors, privacy, and ensurin...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important areas, including privacy, safety, and ethical considerat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST detect classification requests involving minors and apply enhanced protective measures, including parental context ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST NOT process classification requests for content that appears to involve minors without first clarifying the protect...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on ethical and safe classification practic...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important issues in classification, such as bias, ambiguity, cultu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 67): MUST validate classification requests against potential dual-use scenarios where legitimate categorization could facilit...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST detect when classification tasks involve sensitive cultural, religious, or ethnic content and ensure categorization...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on ethical and safe classification practices.
