  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 19-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of ethical AI use, such as bias detection, privacy protection, and educational transformation of harmful queries. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, privacy, security, and ethical content generation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deepfake requests and social engineering threats. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on broader data security measures and user consent mechanisms beyond specific scenarios..

They complement each other by covering different facets of ethical AI use, such as bias detection, privacy protection, and educational transformation of harmful queries. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, privacy, security, and ethical content generation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deepfake requests and social engineering threats. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on broader data security measures and user consent mechanisms beyond specific scenarios.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in diverse contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification...\n  - [3] (Score: 69) MUST identify requests for information that could enable social engineering attacks, identity theft,...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
