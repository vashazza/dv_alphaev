  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical information processing and user safety. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of content moderation, bias detection, and user interaction. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical AI use. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as deepfake detection and social engineering prevention. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging threats like misinformation in real-time scenarios or adaptive learning systems.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability by promoting user engagement and clarification. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those targeting narrow scenarios, which could hinder adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with information processing, including data integ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST transform requests for creating misleading statistical presentations into educational content about data visualizat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST NOT synthesize definitive conclusions when source materials exhibit conflicting methodologies or contradictory find...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, privacy, security, and ethical content gene...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite adversarial queries designed to elicit harmful content into constructive educational discussions about the ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST detect potential bias amplification in source materials and seek user clarification on desired perspective balance ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical AI use...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite adversarial queries designed to elicit harmful content into constructive educational discussions about the ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST detect potential bias amplification in source materials and seek user clarification on desired perspective balance ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical AI use...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite adversarial queries designed to elicit harmful content into constructive educational discussions about the ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST detect potential bias amplification in source materials and seek user clarification on desired perspective balance ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on transforming harmful or unethical reque...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, security threats, and ethical content gener...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite adversarial queries designed to elicit harmful content into constructive educational discussions about the ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST detect potential bias amplification in source materials and seek user clarification on desired perspective balance ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on ethical ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including ethical AI development, data integrity, and user ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 69): MUST rewrite adversarial queries designed to elicit harmful content into constructive educational discussions about the ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and r...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical information processing and user safety.
