    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing safety and compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of ethical AI use, such as bias detection, privacy protection, and educational transformation of harmful queries. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, privacy, security, and ethical content generation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deepfake requests and social engineering threats. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on broader data security measures and user consent mechanisms beyond specific scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder adaptability in diverse contexts."
