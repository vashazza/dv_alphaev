    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of information processing, such as bias detection, ethical AI development, and user safety. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming harmful queries into educational opportunities and ensuring data integrity. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, security, privacy, and ethical considerations. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deepfake requests and social engineering threats. However, there are some gaps in addressing broader compliance areas, such as data privacy laws or international regulations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While appropriate redundancy exists for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar rules suggests room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
