    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on privacy, security, and ethical information processing. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming harmful requests into educational opportunities and masking PII. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy violations, misinformation, and unethical requests. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and preventing social engineering. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on data integrity and broader cybersecurity measures.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., medical diagnostics and credentialing). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming harmful requests into educational content. They balance security with usability by providing alternative resources. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit adaptability across different contexts."
