    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical information processing and user safety. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of content moderation, bias detection, and user interaction. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical AI use. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as deepfake detection and social engineering prevention. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging threats like misinformation in real-time scenarios or adaptive learning systems.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming harmful requests into educational opportunities. They balance security with usability by promoting user engagement and clarification. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those targeting narrow scenarios, which could hinder adaptability across different contexts."
