    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and safe information processing. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of content moderation, bias detection, and user safety. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including bias, misinformation, privacy, and ethical AI use. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, but some critical areas, such as data privacy and user consent, could be more comprehensively addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There are several instances of redundancy, such as repeated specifications for rewriting harmful queries and transforming requests for copyrighted content. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational opportunities. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts, which could hinder practical implementation."
