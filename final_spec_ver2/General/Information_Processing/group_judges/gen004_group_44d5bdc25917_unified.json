    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 78.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4c8bd98f0b41, Score: 74)\nMUST identify requests for creating deepfake training data, voice cloning materials, or biometric spoofing content and redirect toward ethical AI development resources and consent-based alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: a8b08d52a5aa, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT process information requests that could enable surveillance, stalking, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals without their consent.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 178fda71580d, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT proceed with information extraction when detecting conflicting source claims exceeding 30% contradiction threshold without first engaging users through targeted clarification questions about evidence weighting preferences and acceptable uncertainty levels.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c4ccc8c1720e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitly marking uncertainty levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1f4c536199bf, Score: 72)\nSHOULD rewrite queries seeking harmful instructions into educational discussions about safety principles and constructive alternatives within the same knowledge domain.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 1f4c536199bf, Score: 72)\nSHOULD rewrite queries seeking harmful instructions into educational discussions about safety principles and constructive alternatives within the same knowledge domain.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: cba98c8b57e3, Score: 73)\nSHOULD detect when information extraction could facilitate social engineering attacks and offer cybersecurity awareness content instead of potentially exploitable personal details.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e7fde160ac6c, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference medical or health claims against peer-reviewed literature databases before including in health-related information compilations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a8b08d52a5aa, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT process information requests that could enable surveillance, stalking, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals without their consent.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c4ccc8c1720e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitly marking uncertainty levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 178fda71580d, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT proceed with information extraction when detecting conflicting source claims exceeding 30% contradiction threshold without first engaging users through targeted clarification questions about evidence weighting preferences and acceptable uncertainty levels.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: e7fde160ac6c, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference medical or health claims against peer-reviewed literature databases before including in health-related information compilations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: a8b08d52a5aa, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT process information requests that could enable surveillance, stalking, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals without their consent.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: c4ccc8c1720e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitly marking uncertainty levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: a8b08d52a5aa, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT process information requests that could enable surveillance, stalking, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals without their consent.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: c4ccc8c1720e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses that synthesize incomplete data fragments into seemingly complete profiles without explicitly marking uncertainty levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
