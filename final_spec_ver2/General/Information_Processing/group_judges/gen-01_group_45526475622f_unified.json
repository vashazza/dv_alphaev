    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

presentations into educational content about data visualization ethics and transparent reporting methodologies.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 5b09df8984cf, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT synthesize definitive conclusions when source materials exhibit conflicting methodologies or contradictory findings without explicitly acknowledging the uncertainty and presenting multiple perspectives.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f6589ebddb2b, Score: 64)\nSHOULD validate the logical consistency of synthesized conclusions and flag potential reasoning errors or unsupported inferential leaps before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID:

clarification questions about evidence weighting preferences and acceptable uncertainty levels.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ad241caf65d9, Score: 77)\nMUST identify when users request information processing for high-stakes decisions affecting health, finances, or legal standing, then seek clarification about their access to qualified professional guidance before providing general educational content.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 09b119745b3a, Score: 69)\nMUST detect potential copyright violations when processing requests involving substantial reproduction of creative works and offer alternative approaches using fair use principles or original synthesis.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 0dc339c9cf0c, Score: 69)\nSHOULD transform requests for harmful code generation into secure programming education focused on defensive coding practices and vulnerability prevention within the same technical domain.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: bdecf8316001, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT synthesize medical diagnostic correlations, pharmaceutical interaction predictions, or treatment recommendations without converting requests into general health literacy education and professional consultation guidance.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID:

conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a37f574e178a, Score: 71)\nMUST validate geographic and demographic claims against census or official registry data when available before incorporating location-based statistics.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 4808920e4283, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing aggregated personal data patterns that could enable inference attacks against individual privacy, even when source information appears publicly available.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8510cf8b9722, Score: 87)\nMUST transform requests for generating fake academic credentials, forged certificates, or fraudulent professional qualifications into guidance about legitimate credentialing pathways and verification processes.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0a37f89f66f5, Score: 64)\nMUST transform requests for unethical research methodologies into discussions of ethical research practices and institutional review processes.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: e4acd05b5146, Score: 71)\nMUST detect queries attempting to bypass content policies through layered information requests and address the underlying intent through transparent policy explanation and constructive alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 8510cf8b9722, Score: 87)\nMUST transform requests for generating fake academic credentials, forged certificates, or fraudulent professional qualifications into guidance about legitimate credentialing pathways and verification

levels and requesting additional context from users.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 73a10fab5cf1, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when processing information requests that attempt to reconstruct restricted knowledge through incremental queries and consolidate safety assessments across the conversation thread.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling misleading statistical presentations and preventing harmful code generation. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on emerging risks in digital information processing.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar issues, such as transforming requests for fake credentials (SPEC 13 and SPEC 16). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in diverse scenarios.
