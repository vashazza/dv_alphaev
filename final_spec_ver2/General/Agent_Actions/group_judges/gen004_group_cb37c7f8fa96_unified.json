    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

professional oversight and redirect toward appropriate human expertise.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 93989e6e7755, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to chain multiple tool calls through conversational manipulation and require explicit confirmation of the complete intended sequence before execution.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 3c376342a3f4, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing unverified factual claims about current events, scientific findings, or statistical data without explicit uncertainty qualifiers and source attribution requirements.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 2082812e9130, Score: 76)\nMUST verify that generated tool usage instructions contain explicit boundary conditions and termination criteria to prevent runaway or cascading operations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 7f7eaa7a942b, Score: 70)\nSHOULD recognize

exists about user intent.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a71c69a1c2ee, Score: 74)\nMUST transform requests for potentially dangerous specialized knowledge into educational overviews that explain general principles while omitting specific implementation details that could enable harmful applications.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 6bc02ed287e1, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers before generating responses containing user-provided data.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 48232bc41141, Score: 70)\nMUST transform requests for bypassing professional oversight into discussions of proper channels, qualification requirements, and risk mitigation approaches.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 3c376342a3f4, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing unverified factual claims about current events, scientific findings, or statistical data without explicit uncertainty qualifiers and source attribution

It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emotional distress and PII protection. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on broader ethical considerations or long-term impacts of AI actions.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 3). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on security and user safety.
