    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=20  \nComment: The specs generally work together towards a unified policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in tool usage and information generation. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specs, which suggest a lack of coordination and integration in the policy set. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or redundancies that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The policy group covers a range of important areas such as tool execution, user intent clarity, privilege escalation, and factual accuracy. However, the focus is heavily on specific scenarios like user intent and privilege escalation, with less emphasis on broader foundational rules. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is skewed towards the latter, leaving some gaps in foundational coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=10  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the policy group, with multiple specs being repeated verbatim. This repetition does not contribute to robustness but rather indicates inefficiency. The group could benefit from consolidating overlapping requirements to streamline the policy set and eliminate unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on critical safety and compliance areas. However, the repetition of specific rules and the lack of broader applicability in some specs reduce the overall practicality. The policies are somewhat adaptable but could be improved by introducing more flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n\nTOTAL=63",
