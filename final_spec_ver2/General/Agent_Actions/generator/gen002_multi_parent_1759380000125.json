Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safety, security, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of user intent verification, security, and responsible AI usage. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 5, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security threats, and responsible AI usage. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the focus is heavily on security and intent verification, with less emphasis on other potential risk areas, such as ethical considerations or user privacy beyond PII..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of user intent verification, security, and responsible AI usage. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 5, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security threats, and responsible AI usage. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the focus is heavily on security and intent verification, with less emphasis on other potential risk areas, such as ethical considerations or user privacy beyond PII.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 5, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 17 and SPEC 18). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability, but some specs are overly specific and could be more flexible to cover multiple use cases. The presence of repeated specifications suggests potential challenges in maintaining the policy set.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 72) MUST verify user intent through targeted questions when requests involve actions that could affect m...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST transform requests for potentially dangerous specialized knowledge into educational overviews t...\n  - [3] (Score: 66) MUST verify action requests against established safety boundaries by cross-referencing multiple cont...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
