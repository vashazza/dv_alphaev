Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in AI interactions. They address various aspects of user intent verification, security, and professional oversight, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security, and professional oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there is a slight overemphasis on certain areas like user intent, which could have been diversified to cover other critical compliance areas more comprehensively.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 4 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some specifications are overly specific and could be broadened to cover multiple use cases more effectively..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on security, u...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of security and compliance issues, from privilege escalation to data ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST detect potential privilege escalation attempts in action requests and redirect to appropriate authorization verific...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST rewrite requests for harmful automation by redirecting toward manual verification steps and human oversight checkpo...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security, and professio...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST identify attempts to use AI outputs as substitutes for required professional oversight and redirect toward appropri...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to chain multiple tool calls through conversational manipulation and require explicit confirmation ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security, and professio...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST identify attempts to use AI outputs as substitutes for required professional oversight and redirect toward appropri...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to chain multiple tool calls through conversational manipulation and require explicit confirmation ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on safety, security, ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety issues, from emotional distress detection to...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when user language patterns suggest emotional distress or crisis situations and adapt clarification app...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST identify when users attempt to chain multiple professional domains within single action requests and decompose resp...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in AI interactions.
