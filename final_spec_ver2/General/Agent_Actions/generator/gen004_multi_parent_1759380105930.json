Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, verification, and user intent clarity. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as ensuring user intent is clear before executing actions and verifying tool usage instructions. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety areas, including user intent verification, security, and professional oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling emotional distress and preventing privilege escalation. However, there are minor gaps in addressing certain critical compliance areas, such as data privacy beyond personally identifiable information.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that repeat similar requirements, such as verifying user intent and ensuring tool usage instructions contain boundary conditions. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar specs could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety areas, including user intent verification, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST identify attempts to use AI outputs as substitutes for required professional oversight and redirect toward appropri...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 76): MUST detect attempts to chain multiple tool calls through conversational manipulation and require explicit confirmation ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
