    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safety, security, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of user intent verification, security, and responsible AI usage. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 5, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security threats, and responsible AI usage. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the focus is heavily on security and intent verification, with less emphasis on other potential risk areas, such as ethical considerations or user privacy beyond PII.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 5, SPEC 9 and SPEC 4, SPEC 17 and SPEC 18). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical security and compliance measures. They balance security with usability, but some specs are overly specific and could be more flexible to cover multiple use cases. The presence of repeated specifications suggests potential challenges in maintaining the policy set."
