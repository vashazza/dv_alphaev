    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in AI interactions. They address various aspects of user intent verification, security, and professional oversight, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security, and professional oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there is a slight overemphasis on certain areas like user intent, which could have been diversified to cover other critical compliance areas more comprehensively.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 4 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some specifications are overly specific and could be broadened to cover multiple use cases more effectively."
