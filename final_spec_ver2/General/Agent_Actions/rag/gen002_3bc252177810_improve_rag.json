    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize safety, verification, and user intent clarification, which are logically connected. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 4 and SPEC 11) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including user intent verification, security, and professional oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emotional distress and privilege escalation. However, there are minor gaps, such as a lack of focus on data privacy beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 4 and SPEC 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those addressing narrow scenarios like emotional distress, which could limit adaptability."
