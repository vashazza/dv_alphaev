    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, verification, and user intent clarity. There are logical connections between requirements, such as verifying user intent and ensuring proper authorization. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety areas, including user intent verification, privilege escalation, and data security. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are some repeated specs that could have been diversified to cover additional areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with some specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 9, SPEC 4 and SPEC 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, though some specs are overly specific, which could limit flexibility. Overall, they are adaptable to different contexts but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules."
