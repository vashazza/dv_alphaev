    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and secure code generation. They cover various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy, compliance, and ethical issues. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are minor gaps in addressing certain niche areas comprehensively.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of identical specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specs could be more concise to enhance maintainability."
