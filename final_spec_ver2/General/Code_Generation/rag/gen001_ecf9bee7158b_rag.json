    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and secure code generation. They cover various aspects of compliance, such as privacy, security, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy, and ethical concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic standards and unsafe file operations. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risk areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives and guidance. However, some specifications are overly specific, which might limit their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
