    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of code generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as data protection, ethical considerations, and secure coding practices. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in areas like privacy and unauthorized data collection, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy, ethical considerations, and compliance with legal standards. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as cryptographic practices and automated decision-making systems. There are minor gaps in areas like specific industry regulations or emerging technologies, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to privacy violations and unauthorized data collection (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these overlaps could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness without excessive duplication in other areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines that cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those related to automated decision-making systems, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
