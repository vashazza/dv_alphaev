    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, privacy, and ethical considerations in code generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as data protection, secure coding practices, and ethical AI usage. However, there are minor overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, security, and ethical AI use. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic practices and automated decision-making. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and broader compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs addressing similar issues like unauthorized data collection and privacy violations. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could hinder practical implementation. The focus on flexible, broadly applicable rules is commendable."
