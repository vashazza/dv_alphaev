    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of code generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as data protection, ethical considerations, and secure coding practices. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in privacy and data protection, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, security, ethical considerations, and compliance with legal standards. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some areas, such as broader ethical implications and more diverse security threats, that could be further developed to enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to privacy violations and cryptographic practices. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap and improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability."
