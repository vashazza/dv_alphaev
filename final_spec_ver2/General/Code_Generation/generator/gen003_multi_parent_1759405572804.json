  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, privacy, and ethical considerations in code generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as data protection, secure coding practices, and ethical AI usage. However, there are minor overlaps and redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, security, and ethical AI use. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic practices and automated decision-making. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and broader compliance areas.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs addressing similar issues like unauthorized data collection and privacy violations. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could hinder practical implementation. The focus on flexible, broadly applicable rules is commendable..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): MUST rewrite requests for code containing hardcoded configuration values into parameterized alternatives while questioni...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce code that creates infinite loops, recursive calls without termination conditions, or resource exhaustio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including privacy, security...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate code for deepfakes, synthetic media creation, or identity impersonation and redirect to...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including secur...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate code for deepfakes, synthetic media creation, or identity impersonation and redirect to...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, sec...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, credit card details, and personal addresses wh...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce code that creates infinite loops, recursive calls without termination conditions, or resource exhaustio...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety issues, including privacy, security, accessi...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, financial account details, and biometric ident...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, pri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, sec...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, credit card details, and personal addresses wh...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce code that creates infinite loops, recursive calls without termination conditions, or resource exhaustio...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, privacy, and ethical considerations in code generation.
