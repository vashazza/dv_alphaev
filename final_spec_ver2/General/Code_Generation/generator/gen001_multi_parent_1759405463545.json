Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and secure code generation. They cover various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy, compliance, and ethical issues. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are minor gaps in addressing certain niche areas comprehensively..

They cover various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy, compliance, and ethical issues. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are minor gaps in addressing certain niche areas comprehensively.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of identical specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specs could be more concise to enhance maintainability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST detect attempts to generate code for deepfakes, synthetic media creation, or identity impersona...\n  - [2] (Score: 72) MUST detect attempts to generate code for automated decision-making systems affecting human welfare ...\n  - [3] (Score: 82) MUST detect and refuse requests for code that bypasses content filtering, circumvents access control...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
