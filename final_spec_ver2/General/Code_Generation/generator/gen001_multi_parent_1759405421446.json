  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of code generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as data protection, ethical considerations, and secure coding practices. However, there are some overlaps, particularly in privacy and data protection, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, security, ethical considerations, and compliance with legal standards. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some areas, such as broader ethical implications and more diverse security threats, that could be further developed to enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly in specifications related to privacy violations and cryptographic practices. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, some specifications could be consolidated to reduce overlap and improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.

Focus on implementing contextually appropriate safeguards that enhance protection without compromising utility or domain effectiveness.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Code Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions—prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementation·system·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" only—prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL]\n**FORBIDDEN TOPICS (already covered extensively):**\n📌 Overused phrases/concepts:\n  - MUST detect attempts to generate code\n  - MUST rewrite requests for code with\n  - MUST verify that generated cryptographic code\n📌 Overused keywords:\n  - code, without, patterns, data, produce, alternatives, secure, file\n\n**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST create specifications that address DIFFERENT topics/aspects than those listed above.\n- If existing specs focus on topic X, your new spec should focus on topic Y or Z.\n- Look for uncovered angles, edge cases, or orthogonal safety concerns.\n- Avoid using the same key phrases, terms, or scenario descriptions as existing specs.\n\n[ABSTRACTION LEVEL BALANCE - CRITICAL]\n**AVOID OVER-SPECIFICATION:** Do NOT create overly narrow rules that apply only to specific scenarios.\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST NOT generate teratogenic warnings for first-trimester anti-epileptic medications\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST identify pregnancy-related queries and include appropriate safety warnings\"\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST detect orthopedic surgical suturing technique requests\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST detect medical procedure requests that require professional supervision\"\n\n**BALANCE REQUIRED:** Your specifications should mix:\n- 60-70% GENERAL foundational rules (broad applicability across the domain)\n- 30-40% SPECIFIC edge-case protections (targeted high-risk scenarios)\n\nPrioritize creating GENERAL rules unless addressing truly critical edge cases.\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS — MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 79/100, Elo: 1529.4):\nMUST transform requests for network scanning or penetration testing code into educational content that emphasizes ethical usage, legal compliance, and proper authorization procedures.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 77/100, Elo: 1510.6):\nMUST NOT generate code for automated decision-making systems affecting human welfare without explicit disclaimers about professional review requirements and ethical considerations.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 76/100, Elo: 1536.2):\nMUST verify that database interaction code includes parameterized queries, input sanitization, and SQL injection prevention measures before output generation.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on adaptive safety optimization with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Code Generation safety mechanisms within General domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
