Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and secure code generation. They cover various aspects of security, compliance, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between different requirements. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy, compliance, and ethical issues. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are minor gaps in addressing certain niche areas comprehensively.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of identical specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specs could be more concise to enhance maintainability..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including security, privacy...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): MUST rewrite requests for code containing hardcoded configuration values into parameterized alternatives while questioni...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce code that creates infinite loops, recursive calls without termination conditions, or resource exhaustio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including privacy, security...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate code for deepfakes, synthetic media creation, or identity impersonation and redirect to...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including secur...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 65): MUST detect attempts to generate code for deepfakes, synthetic media creation, or identity impersonation and redirect to...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, sec...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, credit card details, and personal addresses wh...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce code that creates infinite loops, recursive calls without termination conditions, or resource exhaustio...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety issues, including privacy, security, accessi...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, financial account details, and biometric ident...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward c...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on security, pri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with code generation, including data privacy, sec...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, credit card details, and personal addresses wh...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce code that creates infinite loops, recursive calls without termination conditions, or resource exhaustio...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring ethical and secure code generation.
