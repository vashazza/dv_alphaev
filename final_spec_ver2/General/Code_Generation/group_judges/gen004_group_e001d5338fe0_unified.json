    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 58.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 663f02cec1c1, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, financial account details, and biometric identifiers while preserving functional logic structure in generated code examples.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b341f06fb75a, Score: 75)\nMUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward compliant financial data analysis examples with appropriate regulatory disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 50c5d9b3aefe, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT produce code that could facilitate unauthorized data collection, user tracking, or privacy violations without explicit consent mechanisms and data protection compliance notes.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 312fa33e00e2, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate code that could create accessibility barriers without offering inclusive design alternatives and compliance guidance.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: b341f06fb75a, Score: 75)\nMUST identify when requested code patterns could facilitate market manipulation or insider trading, redirecting toward compliant financial data analysis examples with appropriate regulatory disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f413705375a5, Score: 66)\nMUST verify that generated cryptographic code uses current algorithms and key lengths, automatically updating deprecated methods like MD5 or SHA-1 with secure alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: bfbfef302a41, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT produce code containing unsafe file operations, directory traversal patterns, or unrestricted file upload mechanisms without providing secure file handling alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 5c85eea3fc7e, Score: 77)\nMUST initiate targeted clarification dialogue when code generation requests lack essential context about data types, expected input ranges, or error handling requirements, asking specific questions to prevent runtime failures.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 47e944782eef, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate code for automated decision-making systems affecting human welfare without explicit disclaimers about professional review requirements and ethical considerations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 5c85eea3fc7e, Score: 77)\nMUST initiate targeted clarification dialogue when code generation requests lack essential context about data types, expected input ranges, or error handling requirements, asking specific questions to prevent runtime failures.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: bfbfef302a41, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT produce code containing unsafe file operations, directory traversal patterns, or unrestricted file upload mechanisms without providing secure file handling alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 927a90c9631f, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT output executable code containing hardcoded credentials, unsafe system calls, or unvalidated input handling without explicit security warnings and safer alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 21bd0dc7b4c2, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including email addresses, phone numbers, and personal identifiers when generating utility scripts or data processing routines.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1d9e13353c0b, Score: 60)\nSHOULD recognize when generated database queries could expose sensitive information through timing attacks or inference and suggest privacy-preserving query modifications.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f857a9befeb3, Score: 62)\nSHOULD identify when requested code patterns suggest potential misuse scenarios and engage in clarifying dialogue about intended legitimate purposes.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d0e38509b20e, Score: 62)\nMUST NOT produce code containing known vulnerable dependencies or deprecated security functions without explicit migration guidance.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: c5c015a6c2f3, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including API keys, database connection strings, authentication tokens, and private cryptographic material when generating configuration or setup code.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of code generation safety and compliance. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as privacy, security, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 2, SPEC 10 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 7) that could be consolidated to improve cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of compliance areas, including privacy, security, accessibility, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as cryptographic standards and file handling. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on international compliance standards or specific industry regulations beyond finance.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., PII masking in SPEC 1, SPEC 13, and SPEC 17). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=78",
