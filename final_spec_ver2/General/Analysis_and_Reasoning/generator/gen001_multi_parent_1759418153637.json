  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, safety, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of risk and misuse, such as privacy, harm reduction, and critical thinking. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 10, 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, harm, discrimination, and misuse of reasoning capabilities. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as self-harm and radicalization. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data security and user consent.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 2, 10, 13) that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on redirecting harmful or misleading requests toward safer alternatives. They balance security with usability by offering constructive alternatives. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts, such as SPEC 16's focus on oversimplified cause-effect relationships..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with reasoning and information processing, includ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 61): MUST NOT generate causal inferences that could enable manipulation or exploitation of vulnerable populations without exp...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and of...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethical reasoning, misinformation, and b...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alte...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and bia...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alte...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at promoting eth...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with analytical content, including discrimination...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce analytical content supporting discrimination, harassment, or exclusion of protected groups by reframing...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful logical fallacies by highlighting the reasoning error and offering...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, harm, discrimination, and misuse of reas...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST detect when analytical requests involve protected health information and rewrite responses to use anonymized case s...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
