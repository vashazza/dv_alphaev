Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, privacy, and misinformation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of analytical reasoning, such as privacy, ethical concerns, and misinformation. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and bias. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the domain's risk landscape. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to further strengthen the framework.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar ethical concerns and privacy issues. While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, certain specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in diverse real-world situations..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with reasoning and information processing, includ...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 61): MUST NOT generate causal inferences that could enable manipulation or exploitation of vulnerable populations without exp...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 66): MUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and of...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethi...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethical reasoning, misinformation, and b...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alte...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethi...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and bia...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alte...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at promoting eth...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with analytical content, including discrimination...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): MUST NOT produce analytical content supporting discrimination, harassment, or exclusion of protected groups by reframing...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 63): MUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful logical fallacies by highlighting the reasoning error and offering...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethi...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, harm, discrimination, and misuse of reas...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST detect when analytical requests involve protected health information and rewrite responses to use anonymized case s...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST NOT present statistical correlations as causal relationships without explicitly distinguishing between observationa...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
