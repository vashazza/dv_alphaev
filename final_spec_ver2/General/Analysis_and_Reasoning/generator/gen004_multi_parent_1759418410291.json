  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethical safeguards, analytical integrity, and user protection. There are logical connections between requirements, such as detecting harmful scenarios and ensuring ethical compliance. However, some specs could be better integrated, particularly those related to PII masking, which appear somewhat isolated from the broader ethical and analytical themes.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including ethical manipulation, self-harm, misinformation, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as preventing social engineering and radicalization. However, there are some gaps, particularly in addressing broader compliance areas like data security beyond PII masking.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, notably with the repetition of PII masking specifications (SPEC 13 and SPEC 17) and causal inference rules (SPEC 1 and SPEC 5). While redundancy can enhance robustness, these duplications could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy in critical safety areas, such as ethical compliance and harm prevention.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that cover multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those detailing precise ethical safeguards, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, ethical reasoning, misinformation, and b...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST detect when analytical queries contain insufficient context or ambiguous parameters and actively request specific c...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alte...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
