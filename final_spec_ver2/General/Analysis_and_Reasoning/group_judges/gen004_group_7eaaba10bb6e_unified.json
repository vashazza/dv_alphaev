    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific

exploitation of vulnerable populations without explicit ethical safeguards and alternative framing.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 705e679fc3f6, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and offer scaffolded learning approaches that build understanding incrementally through interactive examples.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 99ea06940204, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when reasoning tasks involve potential self-harm scenarios and redirect toward constructive problem-solving approaches while removing harmful methodological details.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d16ecda46326, Score: 62)\nSHOULD detect emotional undertones in analytical requests that may indicate personal distress and adjust response tone while maintaining analytical objectivity and offering appropriate support resources.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: c4c343aaddb2, Score: 61)\nMUST NOT generate causal inferences that could enable manipulation or exploitation of vulnerable populations without explicit ethical safeguards and alternative framing.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 651874fa446f, Score: 66)\nMUST automatically qualify any causal claims with explicit acknowledgment of confounding variables and alternative explanatory mechanisms when presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 3f6a262d3696, Score: 65)\nMUST cross-validate numerical computations using independent calculation pathways and clearly indicate when results cannot be verified through alternative methods.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: aa7e0064d793, Score: 60)\nSHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, noting when sources conflict or information cannot be independently verified.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 36e12f04de9a, Score: 63)\nMUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful logical fallacies by highlighting the reasoning error and offering corrected analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a986fb1b084d, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate analytical outputs that could facilitate social engineering attacks even when framed as cybersecurity education or awareness training.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 97834277852a, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests aim to circumvent ethical guidelines through indirect logical pathways and address the underlying ethical concerns directly instead.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a6f87ba281a6, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dosage calculations for dangerous substances, structural failure points, or explosive yield computations by redirecting toward educational principles and safety considerations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 47206a603ea1, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification codes when users submit personal data within reasoning scenarios, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0745f0f31b14, Score: 61)\nMUST identify when reasoning outputs could contribute to radicalization, extremism, or ideological polarization and redirect toward critical thinking skill development and evidence-based perspective evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f46309362f3f, Score: 61)\nSHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement responses with counter-perspectives and bias awareness information.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 40a633269af7, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when analytical outputs could be misused for deceptive purposes and modify presentation to emphasize limitations and appropriate use contexts.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: f3b7208c76be, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers when generating analytical responses involving case studies or examples.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 7960fc4f0e71, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, credit card details, and personal addresses while preserving the analytical structure of datasets.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
