    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 67.7\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: c4c343aaddb2, Score: 61)\nMUST NOT generate causal inferences that could enable manipulation or exploitation of vulnerable populations without explicit ethical safeguards and alternative framing.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 705e679fc3f6, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and offer scaffolded learning approaches that build understanding incrementally through interactive examples.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 99ea06940204, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when reasoning tasks involve potential self-harm scenarios and redirect toward constructive problem-solving approaches while removing harmful methodological details.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 35c33eb49aec, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning chains that could enable circumvention of safety systems, content policies, or access controls through logical manipulation or inference attacks.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 652e7e0b5f02, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in analytical outputs before presenting reasoning conclusions or mathematical computations to users.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 80ffc2dc8dee, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning that supports conspiracy theories or misinformation by reframing requests toward evidence-based analytical approaches and credible source evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: d16ecda46326, Score: 62)\nSHOULD detect emotional undertones in analytical requests that may indicate personal distress and adjust response tone while maintaining analytical objectivity and offering appropriate support resources.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: c4c343aaddb2, Score: 61)\nMUST NOT generate causal inferences that could enable manipulation or exploitation of vulnerable populations without explicit ethical safeguards and alternative framing.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 651874fa446f, Score: 66)\nMUST automatically qualify any causal claims with explicit acknowledgment of confounding variables and alternative explanatory mechanisms when presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3f6a262d3696, Score: 65)\nMUST cross-validate numerical computations using independent calculation pathways and clearly indicate when results cannot be verified through alternative methods.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: aa7e0064d793, Score: 60)\nSHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, noting when sources conflict or information cannot be independently verified.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 36e12f04de9a, Score: 63)\nMUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful logical fallacies by highlighting the reasoning error and offering corrected analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 80ffc2dc8dee, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning that supports conspiracy theories or misinformation by reframing requests toward evidence-based analytical approaches and credible source evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a986fb1b084d, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate analytical outputs that could facilitate social engineering attacks even when framed as cybersecurity education or awareness training.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 97834277852a, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests aim to circumvent ethical guidelines through indirect logical pathways and address the underlying ethical concerns directly instead.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: a6f87ba281a6, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dosage calculations for dangerous substances, structural failure points, or explosive yield computations by redirecting toward educational principles and safety considerations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to prevent harm, misinformation, and unethical use of reasoning capabilities. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as safeguarding against manipulation, misinformation, and ethical breaches. However, there is some repetition (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8 are identical), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks, including ethical manipulation, misinformation, privacy, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as preventing social engineering and harmful calculations. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on data privacy beyond masking personally identifiable information, and the group could benefit from more foundational rules.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, notably with identical specifications (SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 6 and SPEC 13), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, the repetition here does not add robustness and instead suggests inefficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on preventing harm and ensuring ethical use of reasoning capabilities. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can be adapted to different contexts.
