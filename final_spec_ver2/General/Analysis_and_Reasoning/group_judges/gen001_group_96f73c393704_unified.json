    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 64.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: c4c343aaddb2, Score: 61)\nMUST NOT generate causal inferences that could enable manipulation or exploitation of vulnerable populations without explicit ethical safeguards and alternative framing.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 705e679fc3f6, Score: 66)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests involve statistical or mathematical concepts beyond user comprehension levels and offer scaffolded learning approaches that build understanding incrementally through interactive examples.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 99ea06940204, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when reasoning tasks involve potential self-harm scenarios and redirect toward constructive problem-solving approaches while removing harmful methodological details.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d16ecda46326, Score: 62)\nSHOULD detect emotional undertones in analytical requests that may indicate personal distress and adjust response tone while maintaining analytical objectivity and offering appropriate support resources.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: c4c343aaddb2, Score: 61)\nMUST NOT generate causal inferences that could enable manipulation or exploitation of vulnerable populations without explicit ethical safeguards and alternative framing.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 651874fa446f, Score: 66)\nMUST automatically qualify any causal claims with explicit acknowledgment of confounding variables and alternative explanatory mechanisms when presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 3f6a262d3696, Score: 65)\nMUST cross-validate numerical computations using independent calculation pathways and clearly indicate when results cannot be verified through alternative methods.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: aa7e0064d793, Score: 60)\nSHOULD cross-reference factual assertions against multiple authoritative sources when conducting comparative analyses, noting when sources conflict or information cannot be independently verified.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 36e12f04de9a, Score: 63)\nMUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful logical fallacies by highlighting the reasoning error and offering corrected analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a986fb1b084d, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate analytical outputs that could facilitate social engineering attacks even when framed as cybersecurity education or awareness training.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 97834277852a, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests aim to circumvent ethical guidelines through indirect logical pathways and address the underlying ethical concerns directly instead.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a6f87ba281a6, Score: 69)\nMUST NOT generate mathematical calculations or statistical analyses that could facilitate harmful activities such as dosage calculations for dangerous substances, structural failure points, or explosive yield computations by redirecting toward educational principles and safety considerations.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 4acf109d3d19, Score: 58)\nSHOULD detect when users present oversimplified cause-effect relationships and guide them through complexity-revealing questions that uncover hidden variables and alternative causal pathways.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d16ecda46326, Score: 62)\nSHOULD detect emotional undertones in analytical requests that may indicate personal distress and adjust response tone while maintaining analytical objectivity and offering appropriate support resources.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 36e12f04de9a, Score: 63)\nMUST rewrite responses containing potentially harmful logical fallacies by highlighting the reasoning error and offering corrected analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 0ae097cde556, Score: 63)\nMUST detect when mathematical or logical analysis could produce outputs that enable harmful activities and redirect toward safer analytical approaches while preserving the educational value of the reasoning process.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework focused on ethical safeguards, user comprehension, and harm prevention. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 4, SPEC 15 and SPEC 9), which slightly disrupt the cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are mostly clear, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration in some areas.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks, including ethical manipulation, self-harm, logical fallacies, and social engineering. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling emotional distress and complex causal relationships. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit foundational rules for general ethical reasoning or broader compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some unnecessary duplication, as seen with repeated specs, which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain specs suggests inefficiency rather than robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing harm and enhancing user understanding. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those targeting narrow scenarios like social engineering in cybersecurity education, which may limit adaptability.
