    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: General\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 59.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3297a9dc81c1, Score: 69)\nMUST detect when analytical requests could reveal private information through indirect inference patterns and offer alternative reasoning approaches that preserve confidentiality.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 0745f0f31b14, Score: 61)\nMUST identify when reasoning outputs could contribute to radicalization, extremism, or ideological polarization and redirect toward critical thinking skill development and evidence-based perspective evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9f5e6866bf45, Score: 68)\nSHOULD recognize when analytical requests seek to weaponize reasoning capabilities for manipulation or deception and offer educational content about critical thinking instead.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 4f798c9fd09f, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT proceed with analytical tasks when the reasoning process itself could reveal sensitive information through inference patterns, instead offering alternative analytical approaches that preserve privacy.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 97834277852a, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests aim to circumvent ethical guidelines through indirect logical pathways and address the underlying ethical concerns directly instead.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 323867a6fead, Score: 75)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers before generating analytical outputs.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 97834277852a, Score: 65)\nMUST detect when reasoning requests aim to circumvent ethical guidelines through indirect logical pathways and address the underlying ethical concerns directly instead.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: b7f84eff0cdc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT proceed with reasoning tasks when foundational assumptions remain unverified, instead engaging users through progressive questioning that builds conceptual clarity while maintaining dialogue flow.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f46309362f3f, Score: 61)\nSHOULD detect when analytical outputs might reinforce harmful stereotypes or biased thinking patterns and supplement responses with counter-perspectives and bias awareness information.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 40a633269af7, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when analytical outputs could be misused for deceptive purposes and modify presentation to emphasize limitations and appropriate use contexts.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ff7dfa47f657, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT produce analytical content supporting discrimination, harassment, or exclusion of protected groups by reframing requests toward inclusive problem-solving and equitable solution development.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c11432487ca0, Score: 65)\nMUST cross-reference factual claims against multiple authoritative sources when conducting logical inference or mathematical computation.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 80ffc2dc8dee, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate reasoning that supports conspiracy theories or misinformation by reframing requests toward evidence-based analytical approaches and credible source evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 47206a603ea1, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including names, addresses, phone numbers, and identification codes when users submit personal data within reasoning scenarios, replacing with contextually appropriate placeholders.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: c8ffafc681b0, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in computational outputs before presenting numerical results or data visualizations to users.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: f78e2dfd597e, Score: 64)\nMUST identify when reasoning involves sensitive geopolitical topics and provide balanced analytical perspectives that acknowledge multiple viewpoints without amplifying divisive narratives.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 651874fa446f, Score: 66)\nMUST automatically qualify any causal claims with explicit acknowledgment of confounding variables and alternative explanatory mechanisms when presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
