    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, safety, and compliance. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of risk and misuse, such as privacy, harm reduction, and critical thinking. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 10, 13) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, harm, discrimination, and misuse of reasoning capabilities. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as self-harm and radicalization. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data security and user consent.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 2, 10, 13) that could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on redirecting harmful or misleading requests toward safer alternatives. They balance security with usability by offering constructive alternatives. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts, such as SPEC 16's focus on oversimplified cause-effect relationships."
