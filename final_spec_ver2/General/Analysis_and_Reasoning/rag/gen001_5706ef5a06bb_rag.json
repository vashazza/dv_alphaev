    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethical reasoning, privacy, and misinformation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of analytical reasoning, such as privacy, ethical concerns, and misinformation. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, ethics, misinformation, and bias. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the domain's risk landscape. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to further strengthen the framework.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing similar ethical concerns and privacy issues. While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, certain specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation in diverse real-world situations."
