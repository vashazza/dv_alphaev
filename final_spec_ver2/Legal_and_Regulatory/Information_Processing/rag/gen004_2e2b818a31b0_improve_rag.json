    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure accuracy, ethical compliance, and the avoidance of unauthorized legal practice. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as verifying citation accuracy and maintaining evidentiary integrity. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from citation accuracy to ethical boundaries and evidentiary integrity. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and bias detection. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on digital security or data protection beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1, SPEC 7 and SPEC 4, SPEC 16 and SPEC 8, SPEC 19 and SPEC 18, SPEC 20 and SPEC 9). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing educational alternatives and disclaimers. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed cross-referencing of legal databases, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all contexts."
