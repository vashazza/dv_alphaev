    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

before incorporating legislative references into regulatory analysis, correcting malformed citations through safe rewrite.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9f30624708e7, Score: 78)\nMUST preserve ethical boundaries by detecting requests for assistance with potentially fraudulent documentation and redirecting toward legitimate compliance alternatives with appropriate legal resource recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3]

directing users to qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: fbed840ff10b, Score: 81)\nMUST verify statutory citation accuracy against official legal databases before incorporating legislative references into regulatory analysis, correcting malformed citations through safe rewrite.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8d55fb1264b9, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and confidential client identifiers before processing any legal document analysis requests.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 4da9b9a7b138, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by rewriting legal advice requests into educational summaries with appropriate disclaimers directing users to qualified

contradictory case holdings, instead presenting alternative readings with uncertainty qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: c26673e1b26c, Score: 79)\nMUST verify temporal validity of cited regulations and

limitation disclosures.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 8a8e3dc6b57b, Score: 81)\nMUST preserve evidentiary integrity by maintaining source attribution chains and refusing to modify quoted legal text in ways that could affect interpretation or admissibility.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9e79f42b2164, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate legal document templates without first clarifying specific use case, jurisdiction, and professional oversight availability to prevent unauthorized practice concerns.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3dda19b97f24, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers,

recommending consultation with qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: ef0ad82938ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate legal advice or specific recommendations when processing contract analysis requests, instead providing factual observations and directing users to consult qualified legal counsel for interpretive guidance.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: c71398cab736, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate definitive legal interpretations when source materials contain conflicting statutory provisions or contradictory case holdings, instead presenting alternative readings with uncertainty qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as citation accuracy, ethical boundaries, unauthorized practice of law, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 6 and SPEC 3, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including citation accuracy, ethical boundaries, unauthorized practice of law, data protection, and evidentiary integrity. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some areas, such as international legal compliance or emerging technologies, that could be further addressed to enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 6 and SPEC 3, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, the presence of overly specific rules in some cases (e.g., SPEC 15's focus on professional licensing status) could limit practicality in broader scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=81",
