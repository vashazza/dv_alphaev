    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

alternative readings with uncertainty qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a504587bc20b, Score: 75)\nMUST verify multi-jurisdictional regulatory citations by cross-referencing against primary source databases and flag inconsistencies with jurisdiction-specific disclaimers when synthesizing compliance guidance across different legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: c26673e1b26c, Score: 79)\nMUST verify temporal

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They collectively emphasize the importance of not providing definitive legal advice, maintaining evidentiary integrity, and ensuring accurate regulatory compliance. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from contract analysis to regulatory filings and evidentiary considerations. There is a good balance between general principles and specific edge cases, such as handling privileged communications and detecting bias in legal precedents. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies and digital privacy concerns.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 3, 4, and 13; SPEC 9 and 12; SPEC 11 and 15; SPEC 16 and 17). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a practical framework for implementation. They balance security with usability by focusing on broad principles applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit adaptability in diverse contexts.\n\nTOTAL=81",
