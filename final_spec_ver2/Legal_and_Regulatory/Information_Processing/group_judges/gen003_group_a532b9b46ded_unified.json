    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specs generally aim to enhance legal and regulatory compliance by addressing bias, statutory interpretation, privileged communication, and regulatory citation verification. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specs, which suggest a lack of integration and coordination within the policy framework. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or redundancies that could undermine the cohesion of the policy set.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=15  \nComment: The policy group covers several important areas such as bias detection, statutory interpretation, and regulatory compliance. However, the presence of repeated specs and the lack of unique, specific edge-case protections suggest that the coverage is not as comprehensive as it could be. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is skewed, with too much repetition and not enough unique, specific rules.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=10  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the policy group, with multiple specs being repeated verbatim. This repetition indicates inefficient use of resources and suggests that the policy set could be consolidated to eliminate unnecessary duplication. While some redundancy is acceptable for critical safety areas, the extent observed here is excessive and detracts from the overall efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=12  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on important aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. However, the repetition of specs and lack of unique, flexible rules that cover multiple use cases reduce the practicality of the policy set.
