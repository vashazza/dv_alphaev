    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the importance of not providing unauthorized legal advice, maintaining evidentiary integrity, and ensuring compliance with legal standards. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the focus on verifying legal citations and maintaining professional boundaries. However, there are some repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from preserving evidentiary integrity to verifying professional credentials and citation accuracy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling privileged communications and detecting prompt injection attempts. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the coverage could be slightly more comprehensive in addressing emerging legal technologies.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of similar requirements, such as preserving evidentiary chain of custody and verifying multi-jurisdictional citations. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of identical specifications suggests inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating overlapping requirements.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines that are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring cross-referencing against primary source databases, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=82",
