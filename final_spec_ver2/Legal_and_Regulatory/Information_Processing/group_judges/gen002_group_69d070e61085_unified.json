    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The specs generally align well with the domain's focus on maintaining legal integrity and compliance, but the repetition of certain specs suggests a lack of integration.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including evidentiary chain of custody, bias detection, privileged communication protection, and multi-jurisdictional compliance. However, the presence of repeated specifications and the lack of some foundational principles indicate potential gaps in coverage. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases is somewhat skewed due to the repetition of certain specs.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the policy group, with multiple specifications being repeated verbatim. This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to improve clarity and reduce unnecessary duplication. While some redundancy is acceptable for critical safety areas, the extent observed here is excessive and detracts from the overall efficiency of the policy set.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=14  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on maintaining legal and regulatory compliance. However, the repetition of certain specs and the presence of overly specific rules in some cases reduce the practicality of the policy set.
