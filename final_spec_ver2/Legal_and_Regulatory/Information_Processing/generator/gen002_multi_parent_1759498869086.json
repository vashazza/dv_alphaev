However, there are some redundancies and repeated specs that slightly detract from overall cohesion. The specs cover various aspects of legal information processing, but the repetition of certain specs indicates a lack of integration.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, from chain of custody to regulatory filings and ethical considerations. However, the presence of repeated specs and some overly specific rules suggests potential gaps in addressing other critical areas. The balance between general principles and specific edge cases could be improved.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, with multiple specs being repeated verbatim. This indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be consolidated to reduce overlap. While some redundancy is necessary for critical areas, the extent here is excessive and detracts from the overall score.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects of legal compliance. However, the repetition of certain specs and the presence of overly specific rules reduce flexibility and adaptability. The policy set could benefit from more broadly applicable rules that cover multiple scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 65) SHOULD synthesize complex regulatory information by creating layered explanations that progress from...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST NOT combine confidential information from multiple client matters or regulatory proceedings whe...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
