    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal legal content processing, such as ensuring authenticity, protecting privacy, and avoiding unauthorized legal practice. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-modal verification and the handling of sensitive information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with processing multimodal legal content, including authenticity verification, privacy protection, and unauthorized practice of law. The specifications balance general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting temporal inconsistencies and discriminatory language. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 13, SPEC 7 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the presence of repeated specifications suggests room for improvement in reducing unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring compliance. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
