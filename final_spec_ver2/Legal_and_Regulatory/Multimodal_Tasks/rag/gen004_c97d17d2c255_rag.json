    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in multimodal contexts, such as cross-modal verification, unauthorized practice of law, and protection of sensitive information. The logical connections between requirements, such as verifying professional licensing and detecting unauthorized practice, contribute to a coherent strategy. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of compliance areas, including cross-modal verification, unauthorized practice of law, and protection of sensitive information. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sealed juvenile records and detecting social engineering attempts. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for handling other types of sensitive legal documents or broader jurisdictional issues.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., Specs 10, 12, and 18) addressing professional licensing verification. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive duplication, but there is room for improvement in streamlining overlapping requirements.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling multimodal submissions and adjusting responses for pro se litigants. However, some overly specific rules, like those targeting narrow scenarios, could hinder practicality. The group could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules to enhance real-world implementation and maintenance."
