    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal legal content processing, such as cross-modal verification, unauthorized practice of law, and protection of sensitive information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including cross-modal inconsistencies, unauthorized practice, and protection of sensitive information. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling pro se litigants and sealed records. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication rather than intentional reinforcement, which affects the score.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and unauthorized practice. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability in different contexts."
