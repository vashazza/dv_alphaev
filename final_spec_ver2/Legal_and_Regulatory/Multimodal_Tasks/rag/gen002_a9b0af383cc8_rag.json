    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They focus on ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of legal documents, preventing unauthorized practice of law, and maintaining compliance with legal standards. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-modal verification and the handling of sensitive information. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including document authenticity, confidentiality, and unauthorized practice of law. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as detecting temporal inconsistencies and discriminatory language. While comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on emerging legal technologies and digital transformation risks.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that repeat similar requirements, such as masking PII and verifying document authenticity. While redundancy can enhance robustness, in this case, it could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios."
