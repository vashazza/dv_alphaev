    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in multimodal tasks. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-modal verification and protection of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of compliance areas, including unauthorized practice of law, protection of sensitive information, and cross-modal consistency. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are minor gaps in addressing certain niche legal scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., Spec 12 and Spec 18 are identical). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add value and could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, though some rules are overly specific and could be more flexible to cover broader scenarios."
