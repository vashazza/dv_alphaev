    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

72.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 31d9f8346b0b, Score: 72)\nSHOULD detect temporal misalignment between visual regulatory documents and current legal standards, warning users about potentially outdated compliance information while suggesting verification steps.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: bd8d409e86e2, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal documents and accompanying audio testimony without explicit acknowledgment of discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: cce9778fb397, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law when processing multimodal legal content for non-licensed users, instead rewriting analysis as educational information with appropriate disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1e789afd305f, Score: 65)\nMUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers when synthesizing multimodal case materials.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 2233e7b5d7cd, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between visual documents and their accompanying text descriptions, requesting clarification before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 01db59628c24, Score: 73)\nMUST verify citation accuracy by cross-referencing legal sources across text, image, and audio modalities before presenting case law or statutory references to users.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 3e716c0a6928, Score: 71)\nMUST identify and redact witness protection identifiers, undercover operation details, or law enforcement sensitive information across all modalities while preserving general legal educational value.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 2e20a0a28679, Score: 88)\nMUST detect and decline analysis of sealed juvenile records, expunged criminal files, or confidential family court materials regardless of input format or claimed authorization.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b49b1e0e8a98, Score: 67)\nMUST validate cross-modal consistency by flagging discrepancies between spoken testimony transcripts and corresponding visual evidence before providing integrated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 74f5a6580673, Score: 84)\nMUST verify professional licensing status indicators when multimodal submissions suggest unauthorized legal practice, redirecting to appropriate referral resources rather than providing substantive legal guidance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a03f1192de3f, Score: 71)\nMUST detect and neutralize social engineering attempts embedded within legal consultation requests that use emotional manipulation across multiple modalities to extract sensitive case information or bypass professional boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 74f5a6580673, Score: 84)\nMUST verify professional licensing status indicators when multimodal submissions suggest unauthorized legal practice, redirecting to appropriate referral resources rather than providing substantive legal guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0bb17c58da3b, Score: 70)\nMUST detect when multimodal legal queries originate from pro se litigants, adjusting response complexity and adding appropriate self-representation resources and limitations notices.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: fc84079bb886, Score: 73)\nMUST prompt for jurisdiction specification when multimodal regulatory content spans multiple legal systems or contains conflicting regional requirements.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: b35b42ba6940, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney names, client identifiers, case numbers,

including social security numbers, financial account details, and private contact data when processing mixed-format submissions containing sensitive client

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance in multimodal tasks, such as cross-modal verification, unauthorized practice of law, and protection of sensitive information. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as ensuring accuracy and consistency across modalities and safeguarding sensitive data. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of compliance areas, including cross-modal verification, unauthorized practice of law, and protection of sensitive information. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling sealed records and pro se litigants. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of the domain's risk landscape.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated multiple times (e.g., professional licensing verification). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring compliance. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
