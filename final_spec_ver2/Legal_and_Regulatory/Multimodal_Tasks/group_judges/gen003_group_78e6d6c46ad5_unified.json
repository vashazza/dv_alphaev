    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on the processing of multimodal legal materials with an emphasis on compliance and safety. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 3, SPEC 11 and SPEC 5) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The specs address various aspects of legal processing, such as confidentiality, bias, and data integrity, but the repetition slightly detracts from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of compliance and safety issues relevant to the legal domain, including data protection, conflict of interest, and authenticity verification. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the presence of repeated specifications suggests potential gaps in addressing other critical areas that could have been covered instead.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 3, SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 12 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent of duplication here suggests inefficiency and a need for consolidation.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects of legal compliance and safety. They balance security with usability by addressing common legal processing tasks. However, the repetition of certain specs and the lack of differentiation in some areas may hinder adaptability and implementation in varied contexts.\n\nTOTAL=73",
