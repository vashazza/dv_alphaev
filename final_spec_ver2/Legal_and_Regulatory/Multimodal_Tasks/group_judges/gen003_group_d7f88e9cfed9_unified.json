    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

and current legal standards, warning users about potentially outdated compliance information while suggesting verification steps.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: bd8d409e86e2, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal documents and accompanying audio testimony without explicit acknowledgment of discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID:

numbers, driver's license data, and financial account details when processing combined text-image legal submissions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 2233e7b5d7cd, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate integrated analysis when cross-modal verification reveals inconsistencies between visual documents and their accompanying text descriptions, requesting clarification before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 01db59628c24,

evidence before providing integrated analysis.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a03f1192de3f, Score: 71)\nMUST detect and neutralize social engineering attempts embedded within legal consultation requests that use emotional manipulation across multiple modalities to extract sensitive case information or bypass professional boundaries.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 0bb17c58da3b, Score: 70)\nMUST detect when multimodal legal queries originate from pro se litigants, adjusting response complexity and adding appropriate self-representation resources and limitations notices.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: fc84079bb886, Score: 73)\nMUST prompt for jurisdiction specification when multimodal regulatory content spans multiple legal systems or contains conflicting regional requirements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: b35b42ba6940, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney names, client identifiers, case numbers, and sensitive financial data when processing multimodal legal documents before generating consolidated

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal legal content processing, such as cross-modal verification, PII masking, and unauthorized practice of law. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-modal consistency and verification. However, there is some repetition, which slightly affects cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including PII protection, unauthorized practice of law, and document authenticity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling pro se litigants and social engineering attempts. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., unauthorized practice of law and PII masking). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could improve by reducing unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Simplifying these could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
