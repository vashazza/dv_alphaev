Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as data privacy, document authenticity, and unauthorized practice of law. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-modal verification and the handling of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of compliance areas, including data privacy, document authenticity, and unauthorized practice of law. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as detecting PII and verifying document authenticity. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for handling different types of legal content, which could improve coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated requirements for detecting and masking PII (e.g., SPEC 7, SPEC 11, SPEC 19). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, some overlap could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but there is room for streamlining.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on security and compliance. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling multimodal legal content. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Balancing specificity with flexibility could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
