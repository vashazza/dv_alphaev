  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They focus on ensuring accuracy, legality, and privacy in multimodal legal content processing. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-modal verification and protection of sensitive information. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including unauthorized practice of law, privacy protection, and cross-modal consistency. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are minor gaps in addressing certain critical compliance areas, such as international legal variations.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., Spec 12 and Spec 18 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, unnecessary duplication could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts. More broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling mu...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including privacy, authenticity, juris...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST pause content generation when biometric data, voice prints, or facial recognition markers in multimodal inputs coul...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 78): MUST NOT process sealed court documents, classified regulatory materials, or grand jury proceedings regardless of modali...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
