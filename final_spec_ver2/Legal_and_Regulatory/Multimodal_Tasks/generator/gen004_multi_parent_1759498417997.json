  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for handling multimodal legal and regulatory tasks. They address various aspects of data protection, ethical considerations, and jurisdictional accuracy, which are logically connected. However, there are a few instances of potential overlap that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, data protection, and jurisdictional issues. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there are some gaps in addressing emerging technologies and their implications in legal contexts. The focus is primarily on foundational rules, with some specific protections.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated or have similar objectives (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 8, SPEC 11 and SPEC 17). While redundancy can enhance robustness, these instances could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing critical safety measures.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, though some rules are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts. The group could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules to enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
