  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 76.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for handling legal and regulatory tasks. They focus on cross-modal verification, privacy protection, and preventing unauthorized legal practice, which are logically connected and complement each other. However, there are some repeated specs that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including document authenticity, privacy, and unauthorized practice of law. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting inconsistencies and masking PII. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of the domain's risk landscape.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., PII masking and unauthorized practice of law). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by addressing common compliance issues. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of compliance areas, including unauthorized practice of l...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 72): SHOULD detect temporal misalignment between visual regulatory documents and current legal standards, warning users about...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST NOT generate responses when cross-modal content verification reveals material contradictions between visual legal d...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
