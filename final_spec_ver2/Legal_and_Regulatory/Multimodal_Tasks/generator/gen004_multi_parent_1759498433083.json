Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal legal content processing, such as cross-modal verification, PII masking, and unauthorized practice of law. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-modal consistency and verification. However, there is some repetition, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including PII protection, unauthorized practice of law, and document authenticity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling pro se litigants and social engineering attempts. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas..

They address various aspects of multimodal legal content processing, such as cross-modal verification, PII masking, and unauthorized practice of law. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on cross-modal consistency and verification. However, there is some repetition, which slightly affects cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal legal content, including PII protection, unauthorized practice of law, and document authenticity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling pro se litigants and social engineering attempts. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain requirements repeated (e.g., unauthorized practice of law and PII masking). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could improve by reducing unnecessary duplication.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Simplifying these could enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney identification...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney names, client identifiers, case numbers, a...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law when processing multi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
