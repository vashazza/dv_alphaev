Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal legal content processing, such as cross-modal verification, unauthorized practice of law, and protection of sensitive information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including cross-modal inconsistencies, unauthorized practice, and protection of sensitive information. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling pro se litigants and sealed records. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage..

They address various aspects of multimodal legal content processing, such as cross-modal verification, unauthorized practice of law, and protection of sensitive information. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including cross-modal inconsistencies, unauthorized practice, and protection of sensitive information. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling pro se litigants and sealed records. However, there could be more emphasis on foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 12 and SPEC 18). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication rather than intentional reinforcement, which affects the score.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and unauthorized practice. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability in different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST transform direct legal conclusions into conditional analysis with appropriate uncertainty quali...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate responses that could constitute unauthorized practice of law when processing multi...\n  - [3] (Score: 84) MUST verify professional licensing status indicators when multimodal submissions suggest unauthorize...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
