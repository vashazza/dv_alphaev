    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory image generation. They complement each other by focusing on educational content, jurisdictional awareness, and preventing misuse of legal imagery. However, there are minor overlaps, such as multiple specs addressing the generation of official-looking documents, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including the generation of official documents, courtroom scenes, and discriminatory practices. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as jurisdictional awareness and the need for disclaimers. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling sensitive personal data or privacy concerns in legal imagery.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with multiple specs addressing similar issues like the generation of official documents and courtroom scenes. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain rules suggests that the policy set could be more efficiently consolidated without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictions and educational purposes. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdictional awareness, which may complicate implementation in diverse legal environments."
