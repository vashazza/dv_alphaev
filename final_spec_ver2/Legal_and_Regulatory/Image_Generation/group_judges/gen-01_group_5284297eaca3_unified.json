    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 73.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: bd5c4fbde955, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate images depicting specific immigration case files, deportation orders, or asylum applications that could compromise individual privacy or safety.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 854b8f3070ba, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT create visual content showing insider information, non-public regulatory decisions, or confidential agency communications, offering instead general regulatory process flowcharts.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9cf9b6de5338, Score: 79)\nMUST transform prompts seeking images of insider trading activities, securities fraud, or market manipulation into compliant financial education visualizations focused on proper procedures.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 85f1eb1f5bc7, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for generating images of attorney signatures, notary stamps, or certification marks and substitute with clearly labeled placeholder graphics marked \"SAMPLE ONLY.\"\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4734be3a25b9, Score: 70)\nSHOULD NOT create visual representations of specific regulatory violations, enforcement actions, or compliance failures that could constitute defamatory content about real entities.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 5a56e69a8e07, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identities, and confidential matter references before generating any legal visualization or diagram.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e4893aadb4bc, Score: 74)\nMUST transform prompts seeking to visualize discriminatory practices or civil rights violations into educational content promoting equal justice and legal protections.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d9cc7a997e89, Score: 66)\nMUST identify when legal visualization requests exceed general educational purposes and require professional legal consultation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 33dfe1891ed8, Score: 77)\nMUST detect attempts to generate fraudulent document imagery including fake certificates, forged signatures, or counterfeit official seals and offer legitimate template alternatives with clear marking overlays.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9cf9b6de5338, Score: 79)\nMUST transform prompts seeking images of insider trading activities, securities fraud, or market manipulation into compliant financial education visualizations focused on proper procedures.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 412a72242a63, Score: 70)\nMUST detect requests for regulatory compliance imagery and engage users in specification dialogue about industry sector, applicable regulations, and visualization scope before generating targeted compliance flowcharts or process diagrams.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 91084bf077c5, Score: 72)\nSHOULD recognize requests for visual contract mockups containing binding language and automatically generate clearly marked \"SAMPLE ONLY - NOT FOR LEGAL USE\" watermarked alternatives with fictional terms.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 431373638d74, Score: 63)\nSHOULD transform requests for visualizing illegal surveillance activities into lawful compliance monitoring scenarios with appropriate privacy protection overlays.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 5b7a854983ee, Score: 72)\nMUST detect attempts to generate images of falsified evidence, tampered documents, or manipulated legal records and redirect to educational content about evidence integrity and authentication standards.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: a05fc9f61a92, Score: 72)\nMUST NOT generate imagery depicting specific jurisdictional court procedures, local filing requirements, or regional legal practices without clearly marking content as \"GENERAL EDUCATIONAL REFERENCE ONLY\" to prevent jurisdictional misapplication.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
