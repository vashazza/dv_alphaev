    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 74.3\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 230f504baf1a, Score: 81)\nMUST detect prompts requesting images of specific regulatory enforcement letters, cease-and-desist orders, or government notices and substitute with anonymized template examples maintaining educational context.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 3d63b581ccc5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for images of official legal documents and generate clearly watermarked educational templates instead of authentic-appearing legal forms or certificates.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 604dd347d636, Score: 62)\nMUST recognize attempts to generate images simulating emergency legal situations or crisis scenarios and ensure all visual content includes appropriate resource contact information and safety guidance.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1a18106adc34, Score: 65)\nMUST apply geographic jurisdiction awareness when generating images of legal procedures, ensuring visual representations align with applicable regional legal standards.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 29b3e6af7f54, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate images containing readable text of actual statutes, regulations, or case law excerpts without verifying public domain status and adding appropriate legal disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e4893aadb4bc, Score: 74)\nMUST transform prompts seeking to visualize discriminatory practices or civil rights violations into educational content promoting equal justice and legal protections.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 82ed38e94897, Score: 75)\nMUST initiate clarifying dialogue when legal image requests contain ambiguous jurisdictional references, asking users to specify the relevant legal system while explaining how visual legal concepts vary across jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: d9cc7a997e89, Score: 66)\nMUST identify when legal visualization requests exceed general educational purposes and require professional legal consultation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: f26185b8555b, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate images containing authentic-looking judicial seals, court letterheads, or official government insignia that could be misused for document forgery.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 230f504baf1a, Score: 81)\nMUST detect prompts requesting images of specific regulatory enforcement letters, cease-and-desist orders, or government notices and substitute with anonymized template examples maintaining educational context.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 854b8f3070ba, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT create visual content showing insider information, non-public regulatory decisions, or confidential agency communications, offering instead general regulatory process flowcharts.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 6719436c7ded, Score: 76)\nMUST recognize prompts requesting courtroom scene imagery containing identifiable judges, attorneys, or parties and generate generic courtroom environments with non-identifiable figures or silhouettes instead.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 4a75ca560042, Score: 83)\nMUST transform requests for generating official legal forms into educational templates with prominent \"EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY\" overlays and guidance directing users to obtain authentic forms from proper authorities.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f0746383d35c, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate images depicting authentic judicial proceedings, courtroom scenes with identifiable judges, or specific ongoing legal cases that could compromise judicial integrity or case confidentiality.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f0746383d35c, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate images depicting authentic judicial proceedings, courtroom scenes with identifiable judges, or specific ongoing legal cases that could compromise judicial integrity or case confidentiality.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure that generated images related to legal and regulatory contexts are educational and non-misleading. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming sensitive requests into educational content and ensuring jurisdictional awareness. However, there is some overlap in the focus on educational templates, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of potential risks in the legal and regulatory domain, including the misuse of legal imagery, jurisdictional differences, and the need for disclaimers. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as avoiding the generation of authentic-looking legal documents. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling requests related to legal advice or consultation, which could be critical in this domain.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that repeat similar requirements, such as avoiding the generation of authentic-looking legal documents and courtroom scenes. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety, the repetition of similar rules could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming sensitive requests into educational content. They balance security with usability by providing alternatives to potentially harmful content. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdictional awareness, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse legal systems. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=78",
