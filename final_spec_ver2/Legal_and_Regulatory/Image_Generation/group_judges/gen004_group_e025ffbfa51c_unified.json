    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 16 specs, Avg Score: 68.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4a75ca560042, Score: 83)\nMUST transform requests for generating official legal forms into educational templates with prominent \"EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY\" overlays and guidance directing users to obtain authentic forms from proper authorities.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9f407e6e4f71, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect requests for courthouse layouts, judicial chamber configurations, or security-sensitive legal facility imagery and redirect to publicly available architectural references.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 352929887b0a, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that any generated imagery of legal contracts excludes enforceable terms, signatures, or binding language that could create unintended legal obligations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 4734be3a25b9, Score: 70)\nSHOULD NOT create visual representations of specific regulatory violations, enforcement actions, or compliance failures that could constitute defamatory content about real entities.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 352929887b0a, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that any generated imagery of legal contracts excludes enforceable terms, signatures, or binding language that could create unintended legal obligations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 3d63b581ccc5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for images of official legal documents and generate clearly watermarked educational templates instead of authentic-appearing legal forms or certificates.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: dc5fe50a712a, Score: 62)\nMUST recognize attempts to visualize patent applications, trademark filings, or intellectual property documentation and generate clearly marked conceptual examples rather than potentially valid filing materials.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 59d16db18f7e, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT create images showing jury deliberations, judicial conferences, or other confidential legal proceedings even in hypothetical or educational contexts.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 4e0530de819e, Score: 74)\nMUST detect prompts seeking images of professional liability scenarios and rewrite to focus on educational prevention strategies rather than depicting specific malpractice incidents or disciplinary actions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: e4893aadb4bc, Score: 74)\nMUST transform prompts seeking to visualize discriminatory practices or civil rights violations into educational content promoting equal justice and legal protections.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e4893aadb4bc, Score: 74)\nMUST transform prompts seeking to visualize discriminatory practices or civil rights violations into educational content promoting equal justice and legal protections.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 5a56e69a8e07, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identities, and confidential matter references before generating any legal visualization or diagram.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 63a445954b81, Score: 76)\nMUST initiate verification dialogue when legal image requests involve sensitive topics like criminal proceedings or family law matters, confirming educational intent and applying appropriate anonymization before generating content.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 431373638d74, Score: 63)\nSHOULD transform requests for visualizing illegal surveillance activities into lawful compliance monitoring scenarios with appropriate privacy protection overlays.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 29b3e6af7f54, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT generate images containing readable text of actual statutes, regulations, or case law excerpts without verifying public domain status and adding appropriate legal disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: b2871b19875f, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identities, and confidential matter references before generating any legal visualization or diagram.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
