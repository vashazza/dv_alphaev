Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory image generation, such as preventing misuse of official documents, ensuring jurisdictional accuracy, and promoting educational content. However, there are some overlaps, particularly with Specs 10 and 1, which are identical, slightly affecting cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with legal and regulatory image generation, including the prevention of forgery, jurisdictional awareness, and the transformation of sensitive content into educational material. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as privacy concerns or international legal variations, could be more explicitly addressed.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, notably with Specs 10 and 1 being identical, and Specs 14 and 15 being very similar. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictions and educational purposes. However, some rules could be seen as overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdictional awareness, which might complicate implementation in a global context..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns related to image generat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST transform requests for generating official legal forms into educational templates with prominent \"EDUCATIONAL USE O...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect requests for courthouse layouts, judicial chamber configurations, or security-sensitive legal facility ima...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from protecting confidential inform...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST transform requests for generating official legal forms into educational templates with prominent \"EDUCATIONAL USE O...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect requests for courthouse layouts, judicial chamber configurations, or security-sensitive legal facility ima...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
