  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to transform potentially sensitive legal content into educational material, ensuring that generated images do not inadvertently create legal obligations or misrepresentations. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on educational use and the avoidance of creating enforceable or sensitive legal imagery. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 3), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of potential risks in the legal and regulatory domain, from protecting sensitive legal proceedings to ensuring educational use of legal imagery. The specifications include both general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as handling intellectual property and discriminatory practices. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which could enhance coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with SPEC 3 and SPEC 5 being identical, and SPEC 10 and SPEC 11 being repeated. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group does maintain robustness in critical areas, but the unnecessary repetition slightly reduces the score.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming sensitive content into educational material. They balance security with usability by providing clear guidelines for handling legal imagery. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on particular legal scenarios, which may limit adaptability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could improve practicality and adaptability to different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns related to image generat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST transform requests for generating official legal forms into educational templates with prominent \"EDUCATIONAL USE O...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect requests for courthouse layouts, judicial chamber configurations, or security-sensitive legal facility ima...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on tran...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from protecting confidential inform...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST transform requests for generating official legal forms into educational templates with prominent \"EDUCATIONAL USE O...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect requests for courthouse layouts, judicial chamber configurations, or security-sensitive legal facility ima...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
