Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal document classification and compliance. They address various aspects of legal classification, such as citation accuracy, conflict of interest, and jurisdictional complexities, without apparent conflicts. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including citation accuracy, ethical considerations, and jurisdictional differences. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been used to introduce additional coverage areas..

They address various aspects of legal classification, such as citation accuracy, conflict of interest, and jurisdictional complexities, without apparent conflicts. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including citation accuracy, ethical considerations, and jurisdictional differences. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been used to introduce additional coverage areas.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., citation accuracy and masking personally identifiable information). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictions and ethical considerations. However, the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation and maintenance.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 71) MUST validate citation accuracy for any legal authorities referenced during classification explanati...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST automatically identify and handle edge cases where legal documents span multiple practice areas...\n  - [3] (Score: 73) MUST verify citation accuracy against authoritative legal databases and append confidence indicators...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
