Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal document classification and compliance. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory requirements, such as citation accuracy, evidentiary standards, ethical considerations, and jurisdictional complexities. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 5 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including citation accuracy, ethical violations, jurisdictional issues, and privacy concerns. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data protection beyond PII masking, could be more comprehensively addressed..

They address various aspects of legal and regulatory requirements, such as citation accuracy, evidentiary standards, ethical considerations, and jurisdictional complexities. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 5 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including citation accuracy, ethical violations, jurisdictional issues, and privacy concerns. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data protection beyond PII masking, could be more comprehensively addressed.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or nearly identical requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 12 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling complex legal scenarios and protecting sensitive information. However, the presence of overly specific rules and repeated specifications may complicate implementation and maintenance.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 69) MUST automatically identify and handle edge cases where legal documents span multiple practice areas...\n  - [3] (Score: 73) MUST detect when regulatory classification requests span multiple enforcement jurisdictions and prov...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
