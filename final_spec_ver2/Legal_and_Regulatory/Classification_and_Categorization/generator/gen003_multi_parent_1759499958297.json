Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal document classification and compliance. They address various aspects of legal categorization, such as citation accuracy, conflict of interest, and jurisdictional considerations, without apparent conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., citation accuracy), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including citation accuracy, conflict of interest, jurisdictional boundaries, and personal data protection. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data retention policies or specific regulatory compliance frameworks, could be more explicitly addressed.. Target Spec: MUST automatically identify and handle edge cases where legal documents span multiple practice areas...

They address various aspects of legal categorization, such as citation accuracy, conflict of interest, and jurisdictional considerations, without apparent conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., citation accuracy), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including citation accuracy, conflict of interest, jurisdictional boundaries, and personal data protection. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data retention policies or specific regulatory compliance frameworks, could be more explicitly addressed.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., citation accuracy appears multiple times). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, in this case, it seems more like duplication without added value. Consolidating these specs could improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation in real-world scenarios. They balance security and usability well, with flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across diverse legal scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 69) MUST automatically identify and handle edge cases where legal documents span multiple practice areas...\n  - [2] (Score: 73) MUST detect when regulatory classification requests span multiple enforcement jurisdictions and prov...\n  - [3] (Score: 75) MUST identify classification requests involving statute of limitations calculations or deadline-depe...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
