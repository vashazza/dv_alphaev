    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of legal document classification, such as citation accuracy, evidentiary standards, ethical considerations, and jurisdictional complexities. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses citation accuracy, ethical violations, jurisdictional complexities, and confidentiality concerns. There are minor gaps, such as a lack of emphasis on general data protection principles beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 6, SPEC 8, and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like sealed court records, which could limit broader applicability."
