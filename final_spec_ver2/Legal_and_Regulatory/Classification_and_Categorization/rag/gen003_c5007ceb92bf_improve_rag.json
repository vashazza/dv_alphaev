    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal document classification and compliance. They address various aspects of legal categorization, such as citation accuracy, conflict of interest, and jurisdictional considerations, without apparent conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., citation accuracy), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including citation accuracy, conflict of interest, jurisdictional boundaries, and personal data protection. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as data retention policies or specific regulatory compliance frameworks, could be more explicitly addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., citation accuracy appears multiple times). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, in this case, it seems more like duplication without added value. Consolidating these specs could improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation in real-world scenarios. They balance security and usability well, with flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across diverse legal scenarios."
