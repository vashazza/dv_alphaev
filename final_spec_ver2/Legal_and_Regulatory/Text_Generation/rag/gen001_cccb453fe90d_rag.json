    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on ethical and compliant legal text generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as evidence preservation, unauthorized practice of law, and regulatory evasion. However, there is some overlap in addressing similar issues, which slightly detracts from perfect cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including evidence integrity, unauthorized legal practice, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling jurisdiction-specific advice and statute of limitations. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 8 are identical). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication. Consolidating similar requirements could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and focus on transforming potentially harmful requests into educational or compliant outputs. However, some specifications could be overly specific, which might limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
