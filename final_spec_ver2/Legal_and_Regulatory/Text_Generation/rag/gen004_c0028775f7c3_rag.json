    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring compliance and ethical standards in legal and regulatory contexts. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal practice, such as evidence preservation, unauthorized practice of law, and regulatory compliance. However, there is some overlap in addressing regulatory evasion and ethical considerations, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational issues like unauthorized practice of law and evidence integrity while also tackling specific scenarios like securities law violations and statute of limitations. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which could enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing regulatory evasion and evidence integrity, which appear multiple times with slight variations. While redundancy in critical areas is beneficial, some consolidation could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness. The repetition of Spec 6 is a clear example of unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to various legal contexts and emphasize ethical practices. However, some specifications could be overly specific, such as those focusing on securities law violations, which might limit their applicability in broader contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
