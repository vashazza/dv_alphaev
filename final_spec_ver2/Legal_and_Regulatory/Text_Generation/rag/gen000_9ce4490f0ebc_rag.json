    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on ethical and legal compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory text generation, such as evidence preservation, unauthorized practice of law, and compliance with legal standards. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy to ensure ethical and compliant text generation.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including evidence handling, unauthorized legal practice, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling confidential information and statute of limitations queries. However, there are some gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy and international legal variations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with the repetition of Spec 6, which appears twice. While some overlap exists in addressing unauthorized legal practice and regulatory evasion, it is generally appropriate for reinforcing critical safety areas. However, further consolidation could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on transforming inappropriate requests into educational content and emphasizing professional consultation. They balance security with usability by providing flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specifications may be overly specific, such as those addressing expert witness testimony, which could limit adaptability to different contexts."
