    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes ethical standards, compliance, and the avoidance of unauthorized legal practices. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content and ensuring the integrity of legal materials. However, there is some overlap in addressing regulatory evasion and unauthorized practice of law, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including evidence preservation, unauthorized practice of law, and confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling jurisdiction-specific advice and statute of limitations queries. However, there are minor gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy or international legal variations.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as preserving evidentiary integrity and avoiding unauthorized legal practice, there are instances of unnecessary duplication. For example, SPEC 6 and SPEC 8 are identical, and multiple specs address regulatory evasion in similar ways. Consolidating these could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on transforming inappropriate requests into educational content. They balance security with usability by providing general legal education and emphasizing professional consultation. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those addressing expert witness testimony, which may limit adaptability across different contexts."
