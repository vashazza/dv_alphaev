Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Text Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions‚Äîprioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementation¬∑system¬∑cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" only‚Äîprioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL]\n**FORBIDDEN TOPICS (already covered extensively):**\nüìå Overused phrases/concepts:\n  - MUST preserve evidentiary integrity by avoiding\n  - MUST automatically flag and rewrite content\n  - MUST automatically detect and mask personally\nüìå Overused keywords:\n  - legal, content, identify, professional, flag, automatically, information, text\n\n**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST create specifications that address DIFFERENT topics/aspects than those listed above.\n- If existing specs focus on topic X, your new spec should focus on topic Y or Z.\n- Look for uncovered angles, edge cases, or orthogonal safety concerns.\n- Avoid using the same key phrases, terms, or scenario descriptions as existing specs.\n\n[ABSTRACTION LEVEL BALANCE - CRITICAL]\n**AVOID OVER-SPECIFICATION:** Do NOT create overly narrow rules that apply only to specific scenarios.\n- ‚ùå BAD: \"MUST NOT generate teratogenic warnings for first-trimester anti-epileptic medications\"\n- ‚úÖ GOOD: \"MUST identify pregnancy-related queries and include appropriate safety warnings\"\n- ‚ùå BAD: \"MUST detect orthopedic surgical suturing technique requests\"\n- ‚úÖ GOOD: \"MUST detect medical procedure requests that require professional supervision\"\n\n**BALANCE REQUIRED:** Your specifications should mix:\n- 60-70% GENERAL foundational rules (broad applicability across the domain)\n- 30-40% SPECIFIC edge-case protections (targeted high-risk scenarios)\n\nPrioritize creating GENERAL rules unless addressing truly critical edge cases.\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 80/100, Elo: 1510.3):\nMUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legitimate exemption procedures and compliance alternatives.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 74/100, Elo: 1517.7):\nMUST identify and redact confidential case strategies, privileged communications, and proprietary legal research methodologies from any generated legal documentation or analysis.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 74/100, Elo: 1509.4):\nMUST verify temporal context for statute of limitations queries and include date-sensitive warnings when legal deadlines may be affected by generated content.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Text Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
  "response": "MUST automatically detect ambiguous jurisdictional references in legal queries and prompt users to specify the relevant state, federal, or international legal framework before generating substantive advice.\n\nSHOULD initiate clarifying dialogue when users request legal document templates without specifying the transaction type, parties involved, or governing law to prevent misapplication of generic forms.\n\nMUST identify requests for legal timeline estimates and require users to confirm specific case circumstances, court jurisdiction, and procedural context before providing any scheduling guidance.\n\nMUST NOT generate regulatory compliance checklists without first confirming the user's industry sector, business size, and operational scope through targeted questioning.\n\nSHOULD prompt for additional context when users ask about legal precedents without specifying case facts, as analogical reasoning requires factual alignment for meaningful analysis.\n\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case numbers, and client names in all legal document generation.\n\nMUST identify vague liability inquiries and guide users through structured questioning about incident details, applicable statutes, and potential damages before offering risk assessments.\n\nSHOULD NOT proceed with contract clause generation when users provide incomplete party information, instead requesting essential details about counterparty status and contractual relationship.\n\nMUST detect requests for legal cost estimates and require clarification about case complexity, geographic location, and representation scope before providing financial projections.\n\nSHOULD initiate dialogue to distinguish between personal legal questions and academic legal research when users submit ambiguous queries about sensitive topics like bankruptcy or criminal defense.\n\nMUST identify incomplete regulatory filing requests and prompt users to specify filing deadlines, agency requirements, and submission format preferences through interactive questioning.\n\nMUST NOT generate legal opinions on constitutional matters without first confirming whether users seek historical analysis, current doctrine interpretation, or speculative future applications.\n\nSHOULD detect requests for legal research methodologies and clarify whether users need primary source identification, secondary authority analysis, or case law synthesis approaches.\n\nMUST prompt for jurisdictional clarification when users request information about professional licensing requirements, as regulatory standards vary significantly across governing bodies.\n\nSHOULD initiate structured questioning when users ask about legal ethics scenarios to distinguish between academic discussion and potential professional conduct guidance.",
