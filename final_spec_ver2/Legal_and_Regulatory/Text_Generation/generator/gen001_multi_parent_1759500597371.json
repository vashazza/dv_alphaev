  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal text generation, such as evidence preservation, unauthorized practice of law, and regulatory compliance. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as transforming potentially harmful requests into educational content or ethical guidelines. However, there is some overlap in addressing regulatory evasion and compliance, which slightly affects cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including evidence handling, unauthorized legal practice, and compliance with legal standards. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling jurisdiction-specific advice and statute of limitations queries. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more emphasis on emerging legal challenges, such as digital privacy or cybersecurity, to enhance the breadth of coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated emphasis on regulatory evasion and compliance best practices. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the overlap here could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The repetition of certain specifications, such as preserving evidentiary integrity, suggests room for streamlining without compromising robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as transforming specific legal advice requests into general education. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on expert witness testimony, which may limit their applicability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
