Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring ethical and compliant legal text generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal compliance, such as evidence preservation, unauthorized practice of law, and confidentiality. However, there are minor overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including evidence handling, unauthorized practice of law, and confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as regulatory evasion and securities law violations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on international legal compliance or digital privacy laws.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that address similar issues, such as unauthorized practice of law and regulatory evasion. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition of certain themes could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to various contexts, but some rules are overly specific, which could hinder implementation in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including evidence handling, unauthori...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
