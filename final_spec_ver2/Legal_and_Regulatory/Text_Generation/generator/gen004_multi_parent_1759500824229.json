  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal text generation, such as maintaining evidentiary integrity, handling jurisdiction-specific advice, and ensuring ethical considerations. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the areas of confidentiality and information masking, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from general principles like compliance and ethical considerations to specific issues such as securities law violations and statute of limitations. The balance between broad foundational rules and specific edge-case protections is mostly achieved, but there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy laws, which could be critical in a comprehensive compliance strategy.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules on preserving evidentiary integrity and masking personally identifiable information. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on securities law violations or witness coaching, which could limit their applicability across broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including evidence handling...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principl...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including evidence preserv...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, from jurisdiction-specific advice to ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST identify requests for jurisdiction-specific legal advice and adapt responses to provide comparative legal concept o...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST identify and neutralize adversarial prompts attempting to bypass professional boundary restrictions through role-pl...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, from jurisdiction-specific advice to ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST identify requests for jurisdiction-specific legal advice and adapt responses to provide comparative legal concept o...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST identify and neutralize adversarial prompts attempting to bypass professional boundary restrictions through role-pl...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including compliance, confidentiali...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST identify requests for jurisdiction-specific legal advice and adapt responses to provide comparative legal concept o...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance.
