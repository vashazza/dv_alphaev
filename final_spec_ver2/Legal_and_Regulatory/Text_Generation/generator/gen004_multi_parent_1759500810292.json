Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal text generation, such as avoiding regulatory evasion, maintaining evidentiary integrity, and protecting confidential information. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the areas of personal information masking and statutory citation cross-referencing, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including compliance, confidentiality, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as securities law violations and statute of limitations queries. However, there are some gaps in coverage, particularly in areas like international legal frameworks and emerging legal technologies, which could be addressed to enhance comprehensiveness.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with the repetition of requirements related to evidentiary integrity and personal information masking. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication of certain specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined. Consolidating overlapping requirements would improve the overall efficiency of the policy set.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, making them implementable in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for ethical and compliant legal text generation. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on securities law violations and jurisdictional references, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring ethi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including evidence handling...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principl...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including evidence preserv...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 84): SHOULD rewrite prompts requesting assistance with evidence destruction or witness intimidation into discussions of prope...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, from jurisdiction-specific advice to ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST identify requests for jurisdiction-specific legal advice and adapt responses to provide comparative legal concept o...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST identify and neutralize adversarial prompts attempting to bypass professional boundary restrictions through role-pl...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, from jurisdiction-specific advice to ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): MUST identify requests for jurisdiction-specific legal advice and adapt responses to provide comparative legal concept o...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST identify and neutralize adversarial prompts attempting to bypass professional boundary restrictions through role-pl...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including compliance, confidentiali...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST NOT produce text containing detailed instructions for regulatory evasion tactics, instead offering guidance on legi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST identify requests for jurisdiction-specific legal advice and adapt responses to provide comparative legal concept o...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance.
