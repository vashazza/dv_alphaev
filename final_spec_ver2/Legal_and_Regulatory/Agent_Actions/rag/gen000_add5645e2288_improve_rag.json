    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as conflict of interest, unauthorized access, and regulatory violations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, 14) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, from conflict of interest to unauthorized access and compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sealed court records and privileged communications. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy issues.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, 14) that address the same issue. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring compliance. However, some specs are overly specific and could be more flexible to cover a wider range of scenarios, such as SPEC 8's focus on indirect questioning patterns."
