    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal interactions, such as preventing interference in legal proceedings, ensuring proper authentication, and maintaining ethical standards. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 3, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, from general principles like avoiding interference in legal proceedings to specific edge cases such as handling emerging technologies and cryptocurrency. The mix of general and specific rules is well-balanced, but there could be more emphasis on emerging areas of law and technology to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 3, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various legal scenarios. However, some specifications could be overly specific, which might limit their applicability in broader contexts."
