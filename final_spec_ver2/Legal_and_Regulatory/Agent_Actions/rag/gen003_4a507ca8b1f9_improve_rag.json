    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance. They address various aspects of legal interactions, from preventing interference in legal proceedings to ensuring secure access to legal databases. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 3, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16) that could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including emerging technologies, ethical constraints, and jurisdictional variations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling PII and detecting prompt injections. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling international legal differences or specific industry regulations beyond licensing.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping rules (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 3, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction disclaimers for all legal content, which may be challenging to implement consistently."
