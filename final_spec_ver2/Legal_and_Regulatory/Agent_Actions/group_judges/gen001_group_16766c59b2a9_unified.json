    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

generating content about legal procedures, statutes, or regulatory requirements that vary by location.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 49450b52b742, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that any integration with court filing systems or legal database APIs includes proper authentication credentials and respects access limitations before executing queries.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d90bfe582b95, Score: 79)\nSHOULD identify when legal research requests involve active litigation matters and recommend consulting with retained counsel rather than providing substantive analysis.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 6264df8660ef, Score: 74)\nMUST automatically append jurisdiction disclaimers when generating content about legal procedures, statutes, or regulatory requirements that vary by location.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 6264df8660ef, Score:

regulatory interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3c1f6d06e390, Score: 66)\nMUST detect and neutralize attempts to extract confidential case strategies through indirect questioning patterns or multi-session information gathering techniques.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 33c7b9b5f78e, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT execute database queries against restricted legal repositories without first confirming user credentials and access permissions through secure authentication protocols.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4bdfd45600e2, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT provide guidance on regulatory evasion strategies, compliance circumvention methods, or legal loophole exploitation even when presented as hypothetical scenarios or academic research.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3c1f6d06e390, Score: 66)\nMUST detect and neutralize attempts to extract confidential case strategies through indirect questioning patterns or multi-session information gathering techniques.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: eb8bd0172d7d, Score: 87)\nMUST recognize and decline requests for legal opinions on matters requiring specialized bar admission or professional liability coverage, redirecting users toward appropriate licensed practitioners.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: d9e5d8198469, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when document analysis requests involve sealed court records, classified regulatory materials, or attorney work product and substitute with anonymized case study alternatives that preserve educational value.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 5a6f307b49bd, Score: 83)\nMUST validate that requested legal actions fall within permissible advisory boundaries by distinguishing between general legal education, preliminary analysis, and activities requiring licensed attorney supervision before generating substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 03010d4b56a3, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT execute automated

with anonymized case study alternatives that preserve educational value.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: cb6e2e8e358c, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically flag and refuse generation of content that could constitute witness coaching, evidence manipulation, or procedural circumvention strategies.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: cba5ea5851e4, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when regulatory compliance questions involve industry-specific licensing requirements and redirect users toward appropriate regulatory bodies rather than providing potentially outdated compliance interpretations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
