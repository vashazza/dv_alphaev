Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as conflict of interest, regulatory violations, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, and 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, from conflict of interest to data protection and compliance with jurisdiction-specific requirements. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sealed court records and specialized bar admissions. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal tech challenges, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive..

They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as conflict of interest, regulatory violations, and data protection. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, and 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, from conflict of interest to data protection and compliance with jurisdiction-specific requirements. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling sealed court records and specialized bar admissions. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal tech challenges, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5, 10, and 14), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical areas like data protection, the repetition of certain specs suggests room for streamlining without compromising robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring specialized bar admission, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST detect when document analysis requests involve sealed court records, classified regulatory mate...\n  - [3] (Score: 74) MUST detect and refuse requests to generate content that could facilitate regulatory violations, inc...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
