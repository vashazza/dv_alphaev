Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal interactions, such as preventing interference with legal proceedings, ensuring proper authentication, and maintaining ethical standards. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including general principles like avoiding interference in legal proceedings and specific edge cases such as handling emerging technologies and sealed court records. The balance between broad rules and specific protections is well-maintained, though there could be more emphasis on emerging legal areas to enhance coverage..

They complement each other by covering different facets of legal interactions, such as preventing interference with legal proceedings, ensuring proper authentication, and maintaining ethical standards. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including general principles like avoiding interference in legal proceedings and specific edge cases such as handling emerging technologies and sealed court records. The balance between broad rules and specific protections is well-maintained, though there could be more emphasis on emerging legal areas to enhance coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 3, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and offer flexible rules that can be applied broadly. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in diverse scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 68) SHOULD recognize regulatory compliance gaps in user requests by comparing proposed actions against r...\n  - [2] (Score: 70) SHOULD recognize when legal queries involve emerging technologies, cryptocurrency, or novel regulato...\n  - [3] (Score: 83) MUST detect when contract drafting requests involve terms that could facilitate human trafficking, f...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
