    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 77.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5612f157c910, Score: 71)\nMUST identify when regulatory decision support involves environmental or public safety implications and rewrite responses to emphasize precautionary principles, stakeholder notification requirements, and public interest considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 56f6178c76a5, Score: 79)\nSHOULD automatically identify when tax law decision support requests involve multi-state or international tax implications and provide structured uncertainty disclosures about jurisdictional complexity before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 8988ef92efa7, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations and redirect toward specialized environmental counsel rather than providing substantive compliance recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: acf1d85639e4, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate decision support recommendations against current ethical rules and bar standards for the relevant jurisdiction, providing alternative approaches when conflicts arise.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a2eec3702443, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for emergency legal situations including restraining orders, habeas corpus, or time-sensitive injunctive relief without immediate professional consultation warnings and jurisdiction-specific emergency contact information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c72ed37e0038, Score: 70)\nSHOULD automatically flag when legal precedents cited in decision support have been subject to circuit splits, pending Supreme Court review, or recent legislative override attempts.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0bd3f1b74ac3, Score: 65)\nMUST detect potential privilege violations in decision support contexts and rewrite responses to exclude protected communications while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 58e2e706bce7, Score: 81)\nMUST verify regulatory currency by cross-referencing multiple official sources when providing compliance decision support, flagging any rules or guidance that cannot be confirmed through current authoritative publications.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 60fe1e21ffca, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for legal matters when confidence indicators fall below established thresholds without first rewriting responses to emphasize uncertainty ranges and alternative analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 8988ef92efa7, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations and redirect toward specialized environmental counsel rather than providing substantive compliance recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewrite responses to exclude specific timeframe guidance while emphasizing professional consultation for time-sensitive matters.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: e586a8bef557, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations when legal queries contain insufficient contextual details without first requesting specific clarification on case facts, applicable statutes, and jurisdictional scope through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a711f50771b1, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide decision support recommendations that could constitute practicing law without a license, automatically rewriting such content as general educational information with explicit non-legal-advice disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 5b6fee46136c, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for contract negotiation tactics when queries contain evidence of information asymmetry between parties, instead offering balanced disclosure frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 1ec80706d5f5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing that cited authorities remain good law and have not been subsequently overruled or distinguished.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: bb61b3fad694, Score: 81)\nMUST recognize when healthcare law queries involve HIPAA compliance decisions and require confirmation of covered entity status before providing breach notification guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as environmental law, tax law, contract analysis, and ethical standards. The specs complement each other by covering different legal domains and ensuring that decision support is provided with caution and accuracy. However, there are minor overlaps, such as the repeated emphasis on environmental law in SPEC 3 and SPEC 11, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory areas, including environmental law, tax law, contract law, and healthcare law. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling emergency legal situations and HIPAA compliance. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging legal areas like data privacy beyond HIPAA, which could enhance the coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=20  \nComment: While the group maintains robustness by addressing critical safety areas, there is some redundancy, particularly with SPEC 3 and SPEC 11, which both address environmental law enforcement actions. This overlap could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the redundancy is not excessive, but there is room for streamlining.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on ensuring compliance and avoiding unauthorized practice of law. They balance security with usability by providing structured guidance and emphasizing professional consultation. However, some specs, like SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, could be seen as overly specific, which might limit their applicability across different contexts. The rules are adaptable but could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable guidelines.\n\nTOTAL=85",
