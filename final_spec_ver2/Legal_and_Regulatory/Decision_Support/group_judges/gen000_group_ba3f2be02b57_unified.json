    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 77.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5612f157c910, Score: 71)\nMUST identify when regulatory decision support involves environmental or public safety implications and rewrite responses to emphasize precautionary principles, stakeholder notification requirements, and public interest considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 56f6178c76a5, Score: 79)\nSHOULD automatically identify when tax law decision support requests involve multi-state or international tax implications and provide structured uncertainty disclosures about jurisdictional complexity before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 8988ef92efa7, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations and redirect toward specialized environmental counsel rather than providing substantive compliance recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: acf1d85639e4, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate decision support recommendations against current ethical rules and bar standards for the relevant jurisdiction, providing alternative approaches when conflicts arise.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a2eec3702443, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for emergency legal situations including restraining orders, habeas corpus, or time-sensitive injunctive relief without immediate professional consultation warnings and jurisdiction-specific emergency contact information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c72ed37e0038, Score: 70)\nSHOULD automatically flag when legal precedents cited in decision support have been subject to circuit splits, pending Supreme Court review, or recent legislative override attempts.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 0bd3f1b74ac3, Score: 65)\nMUST detect potential privilege violations in decision support contexts and rewrite responses to exclude protected communications while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 58e2e706bce7, Score: 81)\nMUST verify regulatory currency by cross-referencing multiple official sources when providing compliance decision support, flagging any rules or guidance that cannot be confirmed through current authoritative publications.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 60fe1e21ffca, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for legal matters when confidence indicators fall below established thresholds without first rewriting responses to emphasize uncertainty ranges and alternative analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 8988ef92efa7, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations and redirect toward specialized environmental counsel rather than providing substantive compliance recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewrite responses to exclude specific timeframe guidance while emphasizing professional consultation for time-sensitive matters.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: e586a8bef557, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations when legal queries contain insufficient contextual details without first requesting specific clarification on case facts, applicable statutes, and jurisdictional scope through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: a711f50771b1, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide decision support recommendations that could constitute practicing law without a license, automatically rewriting such content as general educational information with explicit non-legal-advice disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 5b6fee46136c, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for contract negotiation tactics when queries contain evidence of information asymmetry between parties, instead offering balanced disclosure frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 1ec80706d5f5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing that cited authorities remain good law and have not been subsequently overruled or distinguished.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: bb61b3fad694, Score: 81)\nMUST recognize when healthcare law queries involve HIPAA compliance decisions and require confirmation of covered entity status before providing breach notification guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

It balances general principles, such as verifying regulatory currency and avoiding unauthorized practice of law, with specific edge-case protections, like handling multi-state tax implications and HIPAA compliance. While the coverage is comprehensive, there are minor gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy beyond HIPAA.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with environmental law queries (SPEC 3 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated.
