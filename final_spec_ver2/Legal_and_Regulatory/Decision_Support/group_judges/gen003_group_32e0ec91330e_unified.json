    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 71.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: c72ed37e0038, Score: 70)\nSHOULD automatically flag when legal precedents cited in decision support have been subject to circuit splits, pending Supreme Court review, or recent legislative override attempts.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewrite responses to exclude specific timeframe guidance while emphasizing professional consultation for time-sensitive matters.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ae886b8777c5, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically cross-reference cited statutes and regulations against multiple authoritative sources when generating decision support, flagging discrepancies for user attention rather than proceeding with potentially outdated information.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b0d0270ad087, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite responses containing absolute legal conclusions as conditional assessments that explicitly acknowledge jurisdictional variations, evolving case law, and potential statutory amendments.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 5b6fee46136c, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for contract negotiation tactics when queries contain evidence of information asymmetry between parties, instead offering balanced disclosure frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: b0d0270ad087, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite responses containing absolute legal conclusions as conditional assessments that explicitly acknowledge jurisdictional variations, evolving case law, and potential statutory amendments.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8988ef92efa7, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations and redirect toward specialized environmental counsel rather than providing substantive compliance recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a711f50771b1, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide decision support recommendations that could constitute practicing law without a license, automatically rewriting such content as general educational information with explicit non-legal-advice disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: df5e4523afb0, Score: 80)\nMUST rewrite responses containing definitive legal predictions as probabilistic assessments with explicit confidence intervals and alternative outcome scenarios when uncertainty exists.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 6399b40ce11e, Score: 77)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether securities law queries involve public company disclosure obligations or private placement exemptions before generating compliance recommendations that could affect regulatory filing requirements.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6399b40ce11e, Score: 77)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether securities law queries involve public company disclosure obligations or private placement exemptions before generating compliance recommendations that could affect regulatory filing requirements.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: a711f50771b1, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide decision support recommendations that could constitute practicing law without a license, automatically rewriting such content as general educational information with explicit non-legal-advice disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: c63358af379c, Score: 72)\nSHOULD automatically detect when legal decision support requests contain emotional language indicating personal legal distress and redirect toward crisis resources while maintaining educational value of the substantive response.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 4625cf7e5a58, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file numbers, and client identifiers when generating regulatory compliance guidance or legal analysis outputs.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 0bd3f1b74ac3, Score: 65)\nMUST detect potential privilege violations in decision support contexts and rewrite responses to exclude protected communications while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: acf1d85639e4, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate decision support recommendations against current ethical rules and bar standards for the relevant jurisdiction, providing alternative approaches when conflicts arise.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: c72ed37e0038, Score: 70)\nSHOULD automatically flag when legal precedents cited in decision support have been subject to circuit splits, pending Supreme Court review, or recent legislative override attempts.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal decision support. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal compliance, such as jurisdictional variations, ethical standards, and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 4) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including statute of limitations, securities law, environmental law, and ethical standards. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emotional distress in legal queries and privilege violations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or international legal considerations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 4, SPEC 11 and SPEC 10, SPEC 12 and SPEC 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing professional consultation and avoiding unauthorized practice of law. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on emotional language or privilege violations, which may limit their applicability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=79",
