    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

75.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 5612f157c910, Score: 71)\nMUST identify when regulatory decision support involves environmental or public safety implications and rewrite responses to emphasize precautionary principles, stakeholder notification requirements, and public interest considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 56f6178c76a5, Score: 79)\nSHOULD automatically identify when tax law decision support requests involve multi-state or international tax implications and provide structured uncertainty disclosures about jurisdictional complexity before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: acf1d85639e4, Score: 68)\nSHOULD validate decision support recommendations against current ethical rules and bar standards for the relevant jurisdiction, providing alternative approaches when conflicts arise.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: c72ed37e0038, Score: 70)\nSHOULD automatically flag when legal precedents cited in decision support have been subject to circuit splits, pending Supreme Court review, or recent legislative override attempts.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 0bd3f1b74ac3, Score: 65)\nMUST detect potential privilege violations in decision support contexts and rewrite responses to exclude protected communications while preserving analytical value.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 58e2e706bce7, Score: 81)\nMUST verify regulatory currency by cross-referencing multiple official sources when providing compliance decision support, flagging any rules or guidance that cannot be confirmed through current authoritative publications.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewrite responses to exclude specific timeframe guidance while emphasizing professional consultation for time-sensitive matters.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: a711f50771b1, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide decision support recommendations that could constitute practicing law without a license, automatically rewriting such content as general educational information with explicit non-legal-advice disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 5b6fee46136c, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for contract negotiation tactics when queries contain evidence of information asymmetry between parties, instead offering balanced disclosure frameworks.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 1ec80706d5f5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing that cited authorities remain good law and have not been subsequently overruled or distinguished.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: bb61b3fad694, Score: 81)\nMUST recognize when healthcare law queries involve HIPAA compliance decisions and require confirmation of covered entity status before providing breach notification guidance.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 5612f157c910, Score: 71)\nMUST identify when regulatory decision support involves environmental or public safety implications and rewrite responses to emphasize precautionary principles, stakeholder notification requirements, and public interest considerations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f3c1c1d55307, Score: 77)\nMUST detect and rewrite decision support outputs that could constitute unauthorized legal advice by transforming prescriptive recommendations into analytical frameworks with explicit professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 6399b40ce11e, Score: 77)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether securities law queries involve public company disclosure obligations or private placement exemptions before generating compliance recommendations that could affect regulatory filing requirements.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d5058b6468d4, Score: 77)\nMUST verify through contextual analysis whether contract interpretation requests involve disputed terms, pending litigation, or active renegotiation before generating substantive decision support that could affect party positions.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as environmental implications, tax law, contract analysis, and healthcare law. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of SPEC 1 and SPEC 13, which slightly affects cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory areas, including environmental safety, tax law, contract negotiations, privilege violations, and healthcare compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as circuit splits and HIPAA compliance. However, there are minor gaps in coverage, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy issues, which are critical in today's landscape.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as verifying regulatory currency and avoiding unauthorized legal advice, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as the repeated specification (SPEC 1 and SPEC 13). Some requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as multi-state tax implications and securities law queries. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like circuit splits, which could hinder practical implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
