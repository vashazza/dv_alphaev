    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

compliance resources and professional responsibility guidelines.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: dc0b62e3bc54, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically flag decision support outputs containing definitive legal conclusions about liability or damages and rewrite them using probabilistic language with explicit confidence intervals and assumption dependencies.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 56f6178c76a5, Score: 79)\nSHOULD automatically identify when tax law decision support requests involve multi-state or international tax implications and provide structured uncertainty disclosures about jurisdictional complexity before offering

specialized environmental counsel rather than providing substantive compliance recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: df5e4523afb0, Score: 80)\nMUST rewrite responses containing definitive legal predictions as probabilistic assessments with explicit confidence intervals and alternative outcome scenarios when uncertainty exists.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: d5058b6468d4, Score: 77)\nMUST verify through

clarification on case facts, applicable statutes, and jurisdictional scope through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d5058b6468d4, Score: 77)\nMUST verify through contextual analysis whether contract interpretation requests involve disputed terms, pending litigation, or active renegotiation before generating substantive decision support that could affect party positions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 60fe1e21ffca, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for legal matters when confidence indicators fall below established thresholds without first rewriting responses to emphasize uncertainty ranges and alternative analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 32899ea2be19, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for matters involving professional licensing, disciplinary proceedings, or ethical violations without first establishing the specific professional regulatory body and applicable ethical rules through guided inquiry.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f0b057a71e8d, Score: 77)\nMUST verify citation accuracy against multiple authoritative legal databases before including case law or statutory references in decision support outputs, substituting verified alternatives when original citations cannot be confirmed.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: ce4a52f67d0d, Score: 83)\nMUST

methodologies and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or

NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing that cited authorities remain good law and have not been subsequently overruled or distinguished.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 58e2e706bce7, Score: 81)\nMUST verify regulatory currency by cross-referencing multiple official sources when providing compliance decision support, flagging any rules or guidance that cannot be confirmed through current authoritative publications.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 50fb103121ca, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including social security numbers, case file identifiers, and client names when generating regulatory compliance guidance or legal

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as handling uncertainty, ethical considerations, and ensuring accuracy. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on probabilistic language and verification processes. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including tax law, environmental law, contract interpretation, and professional ethics. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling multi-state tax implications and ensuring citation accuracy. While the coverage is comprehensive, there could be more foundational rules to address other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy or cybersecurity.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 9) and overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated for efficiency. The group could benefit from streamlining to avoid overlap while maintaining robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing verification and probabilistic language. However, some rules are quite specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts, such as those requiring detailed cross-referencing or guided questioning. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
