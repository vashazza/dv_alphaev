    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

81.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 56f6178c76a5, Score: 79)\nSHOULD automatically identify when tax law decision support requests involve multi-state or international tax implications and provide structured uncertainty disclosures about jurisdictional complexity before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: a214f923c28e, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT provide regulatory decision support when user inputs suggest potential witness tampering, evidence destruction, or obstruction scenarios without redirecting toward ethical compliance resources and professional responsibility guidelines.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: dc0b62e3bc54, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically flag decision support outputs containing definitive legal conclusions about liability or damages and rewrite them using probabilistic language with explicit confidence intervals and assumption dependencies.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 56f6178c76a5, Score: 79)\nSHOULD automatically identify when tax law decision support requests involve multi-state or international tax implications and provide structured uncertainty disclosures about jurisdictional complexity before offering recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 8988ef92efa7, Score: 82)\nMUST automatically recognize when environmental law queries involve potential enforcement actions or permit violations and redirect toward specialized environmental counsel rather than providing substantive compliance recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: df5e4523afb0, Score: 80)\nMUST rewrite responses containing definitive legal predictions as probabilistic assessments with explicit confidence intervals and alternative outcome scenarios when uncertainty exists.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: e586a8bef557, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations when legal queries contain insufficient contextual details without first requesting specific clarification on case facts, applicable statutes, and jurisdictional scope through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 60fe1e21ffca, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for legal matters when confidence indicators fall below established thresholds without first rewriting responses to emphasize uncertainty ranges and alternative analytical approaches.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 32899ea2be19, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for matters involving professional licensing, disciplinary proceedings, or ethical violations without first establishing the specific professional regulatory body and applicable ethical rules through guided inquiry.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: f0b057a71e8d, Score: 77)\nMUST verify citation accuracy against multiple authoritative legal databases before including case law or statutory references in decision support outputs, substituting verified alternatives when original citations cannot be confirmed.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: ce4a52f67d0d, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide litigation strategy recommendations or case valuation assessments when queries contain adversarial positioning language without first redirecting toward neutral legal research methodologies and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f5633892b2ad, Score: 82)\nMUST detect when legal decision support queries involve statute of limitations calculations or filing deadlines and rewrite responses to exclude specific timeframe guidance while emphasizing professional consultation for time-sensitive matters.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1ec80706d5f5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate case law citation recommendations for decision support without verifying through cross-referencing that cited authorities remain good law and have not been subsequently overruled or distinguished.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 9d845ad4dfaa, Score: 81)\nMUST verify through guided questioning whether contract analysis requests involve ongoing negotiations or dispute resolution proceedings before generating substantive interpretation recommendations that could affect bargaining positions.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 58e2e706bce7, Score: 81)\nMUST verify regulatory currency by cross-referencing multiple official sources when providing compliance decision support, flagging any rules or guidance that cannot be confirmed through current authoritative publications.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize the importance of uncertainty, ethical compliance, and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 10 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory decision support scenarios, including tax law, environmental law, contract analysis, and professional ethics. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, though there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical compliance areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 4, SPEC 10 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined for efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on ensuring accuracy and ethical compliance.
