  "feedback": {
    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as environmental law, tax law, contract analysis, and ethical standards. The specs complement each other by covering different legal domains and ensuring that decision support is provided with caution and accuracy. However, there are minor overlaps, such as the repeated emphasis on environmental law in SPEC 3 and SPEC 11, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory areas, including environmental law, tax law, contract law, and healthcare law. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling emergency legal situations and HIPAA compliance. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on emerging legal areas like data privacy beyond HIPAA, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While the group maintains robustness by addressing critical safety areas, there is some redundancy, particularly with SPEC 3 and SPEC 11, which both address environmental law enforcement actions. This overlap could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the redundancy is not excessive, but there is room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on ensuring compliance and avoiding unauthorized practice of law. They balance security with usability by providing structured guidance and emphasizing professional consultation. However, some specs, like SPEC 5 and SPEC 8, could be seen as overly specific, which might limit their applicability across different contexts. The rules are adaptable but could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable guidelines."
