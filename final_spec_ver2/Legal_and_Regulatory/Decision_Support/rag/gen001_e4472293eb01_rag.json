    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as environmental implications, tax law, contract analysis, and healthcare law. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for safety and compliance. However, there is some repetition, such as the duplication of SPEC 1 and SPEC 13, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory areas, including environmental safety, tax law, contract negotiations, privilege violations, and healthcare compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as circuit splits and HIPAA compliance. However, there are minor gaps in coverage, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy issues, which are critical in today's landscape.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as verifying regulatory currency and avoiding unauthorized legal advice, there are instances of unnecessary duplication, such as the repeated specification (SPEC 1 and SPEC 13). Some requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as multi-state tax implications and securities law queries. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like circuit splits, which could hinder practical implementation. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
