    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as tax law, environmental law, and securities law, without apparent conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as emphasizing uncertainty and ethical compliance, contribute to a coherent strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory areas, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses foundational rules like avoiding unauthorized legal advice and ensuring citation accuracy, while also covering specific scenarios like environmental law enforcement and securities law disclosures. However, there could be minor gaps in areas like international law or emerging legal technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 1, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are flexible and adaptable to different contexts, covering multiple use cases. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed guided questioning, which may be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios."
