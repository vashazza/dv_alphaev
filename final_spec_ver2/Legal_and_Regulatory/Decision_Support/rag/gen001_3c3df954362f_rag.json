    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They cover various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support, such as environmental law, tax law, contract analysis, and healthcare law, with a focus on ensuring compliance and ethical standards. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation and the avoidance of unauthorized practice of law. However, there is some redundancy, particularly with environmental law queries (SPEC 3 and SPEC 11), which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory areas, including environmental law, tax law, contract analysis, and healthcare law. It balances general principles, such as verifying regulatory currency and avoiding unauthorized practice of law, with specific edge-case protections, like handling multi-state tax implications and HIPAA compliance. While the coverage is comprehensive, there are minor gaps in addressing other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy beyond HIPAA.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with environmental law queries (SPEC 3 and SPEC 11), which could be consolidated. However, the redundancy is not excessive and serves to reinforce critical safety areas, such as ensuring compliance with current regulations and avoiding unauthorized practice of law. The group could benefit from streamlining overlapping requirements to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They provide flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases, such as verifying regulatory currency and avoiding unauthorized practice of law. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to environmental law queries, which could limit adaptability to different contexts. Overall, the policy set is implementable and maintainable in real-world scenarios."
