    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory decision support. They complement each other by covering different areas such as tax law, environmental law, securities law, and contract interpretation, with a consistent emphasis on ethical compliance and uncertainty management. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 6, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12) that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory areas, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It includes foundational rules for ethical compliance and uncertainty management, as well as specific scenarios like multi-state tax implications and securities law disclosures. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the presence of repeated specs suggests potential missed opportunities for broader coverage.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the group contains unnecessary duplication, such as repeated specifications (SPEC 1 and SPEC 6, SPEC 10 and SPEC 12). These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. The redundancy in critical areas like ethical compliance is appropriate, but the repeated specs indicate room for improvement.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, with flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed contextual analysis before providing recommendations, which could be challenging to implement consistently in real-world scenarios."
