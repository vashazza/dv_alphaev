    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal decision support, such as verifying information, ensuring ethical compliance, and redirecting users to professional counsel when necessary. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 4), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including securities law, environmental law, and ethical compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling minors and incapacitated persons. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of coverage for emerging legal areas like digital privacy or cybersecurity.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 4, SPEC 11 and SPEC 9). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to professional counsel and ensuring information accuracy. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
