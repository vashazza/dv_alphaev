    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ensuring human oversight in legal code generation and maintaining compliance with legal standards. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on human review and jurisdictional context. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including judicial processes, legal research, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specs on legal research tool verification and judicial decision-making automation. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability and human oversight. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed jurisdictional dialogue, which may hinder flexibility. More broadly applicable rules could improve adaptability across different contexts."
