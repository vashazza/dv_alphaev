    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes human oversight in legal processes and the importance of verification and validation in legal code generation. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly in the areas of legal research tool validation and judicial decision-making automation, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including judicial processes, legal research, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as jurisdictional context and conflict of interest checks. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns beyond PII masking.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specs on legal research tool validation and judicial decision-making automation. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on human oversight and verification that balances security with usability. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdictional context before code generation, which may limit adaptability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
