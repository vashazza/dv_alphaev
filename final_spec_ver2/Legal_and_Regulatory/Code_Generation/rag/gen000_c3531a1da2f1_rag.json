    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as data protection, jurisdictional context, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including data protection, compliance with jurisdictional requirements, and ethical considerations. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as international compliance and emerging legal technologies, could be better addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6, 10, and 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios."
