    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework for legal and regulatory code generation. They address various aspects of compliance, confidentiality, and ethical considerations, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6, 10, 15) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including PII masking, jurisdictional context, input sanitization, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies or cross-border legal issues.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 10, 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could hinder flexibility and adaptability in diverse scenarios."
