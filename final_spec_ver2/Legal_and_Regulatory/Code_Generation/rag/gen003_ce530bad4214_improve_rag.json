    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring legal compliance and ethical standards in code generation. They address various aspects of legal practice, such as judicial processes, legal discovery, and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 17) that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from judicial decision-making to ethical practices and confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and legal fee splitting. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on international legal compliance or data protection laws.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specs, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 8, SPEC 12, SPEC 13, SPEC 17, and SPEC 18). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unethical or illegal code generation practices. They offer practical solutions, such as redirecting requests to compliant alternatives. However, some specs are overly specific, which might limit their applicability across different legal contexts."
