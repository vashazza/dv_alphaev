    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They address various aspects of legal code generation, such as privacy, jurisdictional context, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 10, 15) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, jurisdictional compliance, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as contract automation and court filing standards. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies and digital transformation in the legal domain.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 6, 10, 15 and SPEC 7, 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios, such as SPEC 13 and 14 focusing narrowly on court filing standards."
