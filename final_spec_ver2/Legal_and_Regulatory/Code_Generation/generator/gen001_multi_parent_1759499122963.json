  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring legal compliance and ethical standards in code generation. They address various aspects of legal practice, from judicial processes to contract automation, and emphasize human oversight and ethical considerations. However, there are some repeated specs that could have been consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including judicial processes, legal discovery, and ethical practice. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and legal fee splitting. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on international legal compliance or data privacy laws.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 17, SPEC 12 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on preventing unethical or illegal code generation. They offer practical solutions, such as redirecting requests to compliant alternatives. However, some specs are overly specific, which might limit their applicability across different legal contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
