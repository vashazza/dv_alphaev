  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ensuring human oversight in legal code generation and maintaining compliance with legal standards. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on human review and jurisdictional context. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including judicial processes, legal research, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns beyond PII masking.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specs on legal research tool verification and judicial decision-making automation. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability and human oversight. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed jurisdictional dialogue, which may hinder flexibility. More broadly applicable rules could improve adaptability across different contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from judicial decision-making to le...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compli...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, including privacy, jurisdictional context...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive leg...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for legal code generation that lack jurisdictional context and engage in targeted questioning to id...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including judicial processes, legal doc...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on legal compliance ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including evidence preservation, co...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): SHOULD identify code generation requests that could create conflicts of interest in multi-client systems and require exp...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 75/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from judicial decision-mak...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST verify that generated legal research tools include proper citation chain validation and primary source authenticati...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including judicial processes, legal doc...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on ensuring human oversight in legal code generation and maintaining compliance with legal standards.
