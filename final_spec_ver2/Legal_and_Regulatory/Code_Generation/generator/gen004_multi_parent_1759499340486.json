Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation. They address various aspects of legal code generation, such as privacy, jurisdictional context, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6, 10, 15) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including privacy, jurisdictional compliance, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as contract automation and court filing standards. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies and digital transformation in the legal domain.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements (e.g., SPEC 6, 10, 15 and SPEC 7, 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability across diverse scenarios, such as SPEC 13 and 14 focusing narrowly on court filing standards..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, from judicial decision-making to le...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compli...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, including privacy, jurisdictional context...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including client names, case numbers, attorney bar identifiers, and sensitive leg...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect requests for legal code generation that lack jurisdictional context and engage in targeted questioning to id...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including judicial processes, legal doc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on legal compliance ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including evidence preservation, co...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): SHOULD identify code generation requests that could create conflicts of interest in multi-client systems and require exp...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, from judicial decision-mak...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 73): MUST verify that generated legal research tools include proper citation chain validation and primary source authenticati...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including judicial processes, legal doc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assess...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): MUST verify that generated legal discovery management code includes appropriate spoliation holds and evidence preservati...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance in code generation.
