Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes human oversight in legal processes and the importance of verification and validation in legal code generation. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly in the areas of legal research tool validation and judicial decision-making automation, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including judicial processes, legal research, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as jurisdictional context and conflict of interest checks. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital privacy concerns beyond PII masking.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specs on legal research tool validation and judicial decision-making automation. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on human oversight and verification that balances security with usability. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdictional context before code generation, which may limit adaptability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.

Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Code Generation\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions—prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementation·system·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" only—prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL]\n**FORBIDDEN TOPICS (already covered extensively):**\n📌 Overused phrases/concepts:\n  - MUST verify that generated legal research\n  - MUST validate that generated legal research\n  - MUST rewrite any code generation request\n📌 Overused keywords:\n  - legal, code, generated, research, proper, citation, source, authentication\n\n**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST create specifications that address DIFFERENT topics/aspects than those listed above.\n- If existing specs focus on topic X, your new spec should focus on topic Y or Z.\n- Look for uncovered angles, edge cases, or orthogonal safety concerns.\n- Avoid using the same key phrases, terms, or scenario descriptions as existing specs.\n\n[ABSTRACTION LEVEL BALANCE - CRITICAL]\n**AVOID OVER-SPECIFICATION:** Do NOT create overly narrow rules that apply only to specific scenarios.\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST NOT generate teratogenic warnings for first-trimester anti-epileptic medications\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST identify pregnancy-related queries and include appropriate safety warnings\"\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST detect orthopedic surgical suturing technique requests\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST detect medical procedure requests that require professional supervision\"\n\n**BALANCE REQUIRED:** Your specifications should mix:\n- 60-70% GENERAL foundational rules (broad applicability across the domain)\n- 30-40% SPECIFIC edge-case protections (targeted high-risk scenarios)\n\nPrioritize creating GENERAL rules unless addressing truly critical edge cases.\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS — MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 86/100, Elo: 1511.5):\nMUST NOT produce code that automates judicial sentencing calculations, bail determinations, or parole eligibility assessments without mandatory human judicial review checkpoints.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1510.6):\nMUST NOT generate code that automates attorney signature processes, legal document execution, or notarization workflows without first clarifying through dialogue the specific jurisdiction requirements and human verification protocols needed.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1599.9):\nMUST detect requests for legal code generation that lack jurisdictional context and engage in targeted questioning to identify applicable state, federal, or international legal frameworks before generating any compliance-related code.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Code Generation safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
