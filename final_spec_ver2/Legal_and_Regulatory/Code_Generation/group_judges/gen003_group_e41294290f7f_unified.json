    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

enable manipulation of legal document timestamps, electronic signatures, or audit trails into secure alternatives with cryptographic integrity verification.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 25ccf2aae770, Score:

judicial decision-making or court ruling processes into general workflow management alternatives.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: faf67ec0207a, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for legal fee splitting code that violates attorney referral regulations, offering compliant revenue sharing alternatives with bar association approval mechanisms.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: dc78cac48fd5, Score: 71)\nMUST verify that generated contract automation code includes proper capacity verification, consideration validation, and enforceability checks before executing any binding legal commitments.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID:

attorney approval checkpoints and ethical consideration prompts.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: fab1d9eb78e5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for legal code generation that lack jurisdictional context and engage

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as judicial processes, legal document integrity, and confidentiality. However, there are some overlaps and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including unauthorized practice of law, document integrity, and confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as judicial decision-making and legal fee splitting. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging technologies like AI in legal tech, which could be critical in the current landscape.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 10, SPEC 11 and SPEC 13). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for secure alternatives and compliance checks.
