    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on legal compliance and ethical considerations in code generation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 5, 13 and SPEC 4, 11, 14), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are present, but the repetition indicates a need for better integration.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including evidence preservation, conflict of interest, confidentiality, and ethical compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as bar examination circumvention and legal fee splitting. However, there are some gaps, such as a lack of focus on international legal compliance or emerging technologies like AI in legal contexts.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2, 5, 13 and SPEC 4, 11, 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects of legal compliance in code generation. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can be adapted to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=73",
