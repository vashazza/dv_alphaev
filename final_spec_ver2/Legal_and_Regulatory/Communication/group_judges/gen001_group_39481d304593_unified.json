    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 19 specs, Avg Score: 71.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 9cc6ac9cd396, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific legal advice, instead offering educational overviews with professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: f63a6355073c, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seeks information about before continuing.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 54ba12a277b4, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically flag communications requesting evaluation of attorney conduct or legal malpractice scenarios and transition to general professional standards education without case-specific assessments.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 67d45eef6a14, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when users incrementally reveal details suggesting active litigation and transition to appropriate confidentiality boundaries while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: f49466ffe928, Score: 81)\nMUST detect requests for unauthorized practice of law activities and redirect toward appropriate professional referral resources with relevant expertise areas.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 2f34bf0e7811, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating industry-specific clarification questions that guide users toward comprehensive scenario development.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 4e05d96cc1a8, Score: 70)\nMUST identify when contract analysis requests contain confidential commercial information and seek appropriate handling permissions before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 4ca413b01e19, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains unclear, requesting specification of these parameters first.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b75547daa5e4, Score: 68)\nMUST recognize culturally sensitive legal topics involving family law, immigration status, or religious practices and adjust response tone to maintain respectful neutrality while preserving informational utility.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4e05d96cc1a8, Score: 70)\nMUST identify when contract analysis requests contain confidential commercial information and seek appropriate handling permissions before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: dce38a0502eb, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT provide definitive legal interpretations when multiple conflicting circuit court decisions exist on the same issue, instead offering balanced analysis of the judicial split with uncertainty indicators.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: fc0992ea5244, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate responses to legal questions when the underlying factual scenario remains incomplete, instead requesting specific missing elements through targeted follow-up questions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f185bf4cd536, Score: 77)\nMUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structured clarification questions that preserve conversational momentum while gathering essential jurisdictional and factual details.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 16955b25bb17, Score: 74)\nMUST validate regulatory citations against current enforcement status and flag outdated or superseded regulations with temporal accuracy warnings before presenting compliance guidance.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: a7f337f0f435, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize when translation requests involve legal documents and append appropriate disclaimers about legal translation accuracy while offering conceptual summaries as supplementary context.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 4e05d96cc1a8, Score: 70)\nMUST identify when contract analysis requests contain confidential commercial information and seek appropriate handling permissions before proceeding.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 67d45eef6a14, Score: 71)\nMUST detect when users incrementally reveal details suggesting active litigation and transition to appropriate confidentiality boundaries while maintaining educational value.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: d1810e5bc9e6, Score: 70)\nMUST NOT provide specific statutory deadline calculations without jurisdiction verification, offering general timeline awareness guidance instead.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 791ff71d4f6a, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal correspondence examples before generating communication templates or sample documents.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventing unauthorized legal practice and ensuring clarity and accuracy in legal communications. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal communication, such as jurisdictional issues, confidentiality, and regulatory compliance. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7, 10, and 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication issues, including unauthorized practice of law, jurisdictional clarity, confidentiality, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling culturally sensitive topics and incomplete factual scenarios. However, there could be more emphasis on emerging legal areas or digital communication challenges.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7, 10, and 16), which address the same issue of handling confidential commercial information. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world scenarios like jurisdictional issues and confidentiality. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling incomplete information and ensuring regulatory accuracy. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction verification for statutory deadlines, which could limit flexibility and adaptability.\n\nTOTAL=82",
