    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes legal compliance, ethical boundaries, and user guidance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on jurisdictional verification and ethical constraints. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas like jurisdictional issues, ethical boundaries, and user guidance. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential legal scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that address similar issues like ethical constraints and prompt injection attempts. While redundancy in critical areas is beneficial, some specs could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining ethical boundaries and providing user guidance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some overly specific rules could be simplified to enhance practicality and applicability across various scenarios."
