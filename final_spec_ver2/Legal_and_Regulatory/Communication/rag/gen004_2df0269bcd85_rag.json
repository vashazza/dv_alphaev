    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on maintaining ethical boundaries, ensuring accurate legal information, and protecting sensitive data. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 4, SPEC 13 and SPEC 12), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including confidentiality, jurisdictional differences, and ethical boundaries. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emotional distress and culturally sensitive topics. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific guidance on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 4, SPEC 13 and SPEC 12), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical areas like ethical boundaries, the repetition of similar rules suggests room for streamlining.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on maintaining ethical standards and providing accurate legal information. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to emotional distress indicators, which may not be easily implementable across all scenarios. The policy set could benefit from more flexible, broadly applicable rules."
