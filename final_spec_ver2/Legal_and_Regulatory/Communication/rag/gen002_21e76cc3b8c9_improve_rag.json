    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes ethical boundaries, user clarification, and jurisdictional awareness. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on user clarification and ethical boundaries. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including document handling, jurisdictional considerations, and ethical boundaries. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and emotional distress indicators. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on digital privacy laws or emerging legal technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with SPEC 6 and SPEC 13, and SPEC 15 and SPEC 16, which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining ethical boundaries and providing educational alternatives. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on emotional distress indicators, which may not be practical in all scenarios."
