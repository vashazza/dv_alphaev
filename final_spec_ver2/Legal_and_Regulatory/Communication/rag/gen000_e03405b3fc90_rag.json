    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as document summarization, compliance assessments, and ethical boundaries. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for maintaining compliance and safety in legal communications. However, there are a few instances of overlap that could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like jurisdiction verification and ethical boundaries, while also considering specific issues like emotional distress and culturally sensitive topics. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of specific guidance on data privacy or cybersecurity in legal communications, which are critical compliance areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules about detecting attempts to bypass legal ethics constraints and prompt injection attempts. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but there is room for reducing unnecessary duplication.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like emotional distress indicators, which may not be practical in all real-world situations. Streamlining these could enhance practicality."
