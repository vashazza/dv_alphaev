    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as document summarization, compliance assessments, and jurisdictional issues. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for maintaining professional standards and ethical boundaries.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of rules addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns. The mix of abstraction levels is mostly appropriate, but a few more general rules could enhance coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules addressing similar ethical constraints and prompt injection attempts. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, some overlapping requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. However, some specifications are overly specific, applying to narrow scenarios, which could hinder adaptability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and make the policy set more adaptable to different contexts."
