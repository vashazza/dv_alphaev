    "cohesion": "The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with a strong emphasis on maintaining ethical boundaries and ensuring compliance with legal standards. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal communication, such as privacy, accuracy, and ethical considerations, forming a coherent strategy. However, there could be more explicit connections between certain specs to enhance cohesion further.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like unauthorized practice of law and ethical boundaries while also considering specific scenarios like contract negotiation and culturally sensitive topics. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns.",
    "redundancy": "The policy set avoids unnecessary duplication, with each specification addressing distinct aspects of legal communication. There is some overlap in specs related to unauthorized practice of law and ethical boundaries, but this redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. Consolidation could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines that cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more concise to enhance real-world implementation and maintenance."
