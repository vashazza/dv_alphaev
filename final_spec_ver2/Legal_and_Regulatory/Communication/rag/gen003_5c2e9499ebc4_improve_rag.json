    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as document summarization, compliance assessments, and ethical boundaries. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on maintaining professional boundaries and ensuring accurate legal information. However, there is some overlap in the focus on ethical constraints and roleplay scenarios, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including document handling, jurisdictional issues, and ethical boundaries. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as unauthorized practice of law and emotional distress indicators. However, there are some gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies and digital privacy concerns, which are critical compliance areas in the modern legal landscape.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy in critical safety areas, such as ethical constraints and jurisdictional verification, there are instances of unnecessary duplication. For example, specifications related to roleplay scenarios and prompt injection attempts could be consolidated. The redundancy is not excessive, but streamlining these areas could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as cross-jurisdictional issues and culturally sensitive topics. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to emotional distress indicators and mental health resources, which may not be practical in all scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
