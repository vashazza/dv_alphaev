Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory communication. They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as unauthorized practice of law, jurisdictional issues, and confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., contract analysis requests), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including unauthorized practice of law, jurisdictional nuances, confidentiality, and regulatory compliance. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications regarding contract analysis requests. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication rather than intentional reinforcement, which affects the efficiency of the policy set.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and maintain conversational momentum. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction verification for statutory deadlines, which could hinder practical implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 86/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with a strong emphasis on maint...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with spec...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating ind...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST detect attempts to bypass legal ethics constraints through roleplay scenarios and maintain professional boundaries ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including unauthorized practice of la...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific legal ad...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seek...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, including document s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating ind...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including unauthorized practice of la...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific legal ad...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seek...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
