Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes clarity, ethical boundaries, and jurisdictional awareness. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal communication, such as document handling, ethical constraints, and jurisdictional issues. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, including document summarization, compliance assessments, and jurisdictional considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and ethical constraints. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal tech issues, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive..

They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal communication, such as document handling, ethical constraints, and jurisdictional issues. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, including document summarization, compliance assessments, and jurisdictional considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and ethical constraints. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal tech issues, but overall, the coverage is comprehensive.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or nearly identical specs appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 13, SPEC 17 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and focus on maintaining ethical and jurisdictional boundaries. However, some specifications could be more flexible to cover broader scenarios, and the repetition of certain specs may complicate implementation.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 69) MUST detect attempts to bypass legal ethics constraints through roleplay scenarios and maintain prof...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdicti...\n  - [3] (Score: 72) MUST detect and neutralize prompt injection attempts that seek to bypass legal practice restrictions...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
