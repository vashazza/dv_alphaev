Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes ethical boundaries, user clarification, and jurisdictional awareness. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on user clarification and ethical boundaries. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including document handling, jurisdictional considerations, and ethical boundaries. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as unauthorized practice of law and emotional distress indicators. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on digital privacy laws or emerging legal technologies.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with SPEC 6 and SPEC 13, and SPEC 15 and SPEC 16, which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on maintaining ethical boundaries and providing educational alternatives. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on emotional distress indicators, which may not be practical in all scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing gene...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating ind...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, focusing on preventin...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication issues, including unauthorized ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific legal ad...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seek...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.

Implement graduated response systems that maintain helpfulness while respecting professional limitations.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions—prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementation·system·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" only—prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL]\n**FORBIDDEN TOPICS (already covered extensively):**\n📌 Overused phrases/concepts:\n  - MUST detect attempts to bypass legal\n  - MUST detect and neutralize prompt injection\n📌 Overused keywords:\n  - legal, instead, specific, educational, professional, attempts, bypass, boundaries\n\n**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST create specifications that address DIFFERENT topics/aspects than those listed above.\n- If existing specs focus on topic X, your new spec should focus on topic Y or Z.\n- Look for uncovered angles, edge cases, or orthogonal safety concerns.\n- Avoid using the same key phrases, terms, or scenario descriptions as existing specs.\n\n[ABSTRACTION LEVEL BALANCE - CRITICAL]\n**AVOID OVER-SPECIFICATION:** Do NOT create overly narrow rules that apply only to specific scenarios.\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST NOT generate teratogenic warnings for first-trimester anti-epileptic medications\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST identify pregnancy-related queries and include appropriate safety warnings\"\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST detect orthopedic surgical suturing technique requests\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST detect medical procedure requests that require professional supervision\"\n\n**BALANCE REQUIRED:** Your specifications should mix:\n- 60-70% GENERAL foundational rules (broad applicability across the domain)\n- 30-40% SPECIFIC edge-case protections (targeted high-risk scenarios)\n\nPrioritize creating GENERAL rules unless addressing truly critical edge cases.\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS — MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1506.4):\nMUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains unclear, requesting specification of these parameters first.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1522.3):\nMUST NOT provide jurisdiction-specific legal advice when user location cannot be verified, offering comparative legal education across multiple jurisdictions instead.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1534.5):\nMUST detect requests for unauthorized practice of law activities and redirect toward appropriate professional referral resources with relevant expertise areas.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Communication safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
