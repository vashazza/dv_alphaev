Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as document summarization, compliance assessments, and ethical boundaries. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for maintaining compliance and safety. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication risks, including document handling, jurisdictional issues, and ethical constraints. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as unauthorized practice of law and emotional distress indicators. However, there are some gaps in coverage, particularly in areas like data privacy and confidentiality beyond document handling..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as document summarization, compliance assessments, and ethical boundaries. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for maintaining compliance and safety. However, there are some overlaps that could be streamlined for better cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication risks, including document handling, jurisdictional issues, and ethical constraints. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as unauthorized practice of law and emotional distress indicators. However, there are some gaps in coverage, particularly in areas like data privacy and confidentiality beyond document handling.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated emphasis on ethical boundaries and prompt injection attempts (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 16). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, some consolidation could improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring jurisdiction verification for statutory deadlines, which may limit practicality in real-world scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 61) SHOULD identify when legal queries contain emotional distress indicators and supplement factual resp...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structur...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdicti...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
