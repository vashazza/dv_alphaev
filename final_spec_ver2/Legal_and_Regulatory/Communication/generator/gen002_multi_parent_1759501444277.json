  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 86.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications work well together as a unified policy framework, with a strong emphasis on maintaining ethical boundaries and ensuring compliance with legal standards. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal communication, such as privacy, accuracy, and ethical considerations, forming a coherent strategy. However, there could be more explicit connections between certain specs to enhance cohesion further.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, balancing general principles with specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like unauthorized practice of law and ethical boundaries while also considering specific scenarios like contract negotiation and culturally sensitive topics. There are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns.. Redundancy: The policy set avoids unnecessary duplication, with each specification addressing distinct aspects of legal communication. There is some overlap in specs related to unauthorized practice of law and ethical boundaries, but this redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas. Consolidation could improve efficiency without sacrificing robustness.. Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines that cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications could be more concise to enhance real-world implementation and maintenance..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory issues, including unauthorized practice of la...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 77): MUST NOT generate content that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by providing jurisdiction-specific legal ad...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST detect when legal questions span multiple jurisdictions and pause to clarify which jurisdiction's law the user seek...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication scenarios, including document s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating ind...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, balancing gene...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): MUST NOT proceed with legal document summarization when the document type, intended audience, or summary purpose remains...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST NOT provide regulatory compliance assessments when user descriptions lack sufficient detail, instead generating ind...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.

Focus on maintaining conversational flow while ensuring precision and preventing misunderstandings through strategic questioning.\n\n[TASK-DOMAIN GUIDANCE]\n- These rules should thoughtfully consider \"Communication\" activities and contexts (model output pre-layer).\n- Task-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general task concepts}\n- Domain-specific considerations to draw from when relevant: {general domain concepts}\n- Use these concepts as inspiration and context rather than mandatory inclusions—prioritize natural relevance and creative application.\n- \"implement/architecture/pipeline/real-time/REQUIRED/SHALL\" and implementation·system·cliche terms **FORBIDDEN** (merge with existing banned word list for enforcement).\n- Do NOT resort to \"refuse/block\" only—prioritize **safe-complete (safe rewrite)**, **minimal redaction (minimal masking)** when possible.\n\n[NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — HARD]\n- Do NOT use these words anywhere: implement, implementation, pipeline, architecture, framework, workflow, escalation, reviewer, approval queue, dashboard, monitoring, SLA, KPI, audit, incident, governance, real-time/realtime, REQUIRED, SHALL.\n- Do NOT reference post-output actions or deployment/ops.\n- Avoid unverifiable claims (\"99.99%\", \"50+ regulations\").\n\n[DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL]\n**FORBIDDEN TOPICS (already covered extensively):**\n📌 Overused keywords:\n  - legal, professional, appropriate, instead, specific, educational, toward, responses\n\n**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST create specifications that address DIFFERENT topics/aspects than those listed above.\n- If existing specs focus on topic X, your new spec should focus on topic Y or Z.\n- Look for uncovered angles, edge cases, or orthogonal safety concerns.\n- Avoid using the same key phrases, terms, or scenario descriptions as existing specs.\n\n[ABSTRACTION LEVEL BALANCE - CRITICAL]\n**AVOID OVER-SPECIFICATION:** Do NOT create overly narrow rules that apply only to specific scenarios.\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST NOT generate teratogenic warnings for first-trimester anti-epileptic medications\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST identify pregnancy-related queries and include appropriate safety warnings\"\n- ❌ BAD: \"MUST detect orthopedic surgical suturing technique requests\"\n- ✅ GOOD: \"MUST detect medical procedure requests that require professional supervision\"\n\n**BALANCE REQUIRED:** Your specifications should mix:\n- 60-70% GENERAL foundational rules (broad applicability across the domain)\n- 30-40% SPECIFIC edge-case protections (targeted high-risk scenarios)\n\nPrioritize creating GENERAL rules unless addressing truly critical edge cases.\n\n[POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS — MUST]\n- Each rule MUST start with RFC2119 (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT). (Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 82/100, Elo: 1507.3):\nMUST identify when users seek legal document drafting assistance and redirect toward template explanation with mandatory professional customization advisories rather than producing usable document language.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1534.5):\nMUST detect requests for unauthorized practice of law activities and redirect toward appropriate professional referral resources with relevant expertise areas.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 78/100, Elo: 1600.5):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including attorney bar numbers, client matter identifiers, and confidential case details before generating any legal communication response.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on interactive clarification enhancement with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Communication safety mechanisms within Legal_and_Regulatory domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
