Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as document summarization, compliance assessments, and jurisdictional issues. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for maintaining professional standards and ethical boundaries.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of rules addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns. The mix of abstraction levels is mostly appropriate, but a few more general rules could enhance coverage..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory communication, such as document summarization, compliance assessments, and jurisdictional issues. There are logical connections between different requirements, forming a coherent strategy for maintaining professional standards and ethical boundaries.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory communication risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of rules addressing emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns. The mix of abstraction levels is mostly appropriate, but a few more general rules could enhance coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules addressing similar ethical constraints and prompt injection attempts. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, some overlapping requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. However, some specifications are overly specific, applying to narrow scenarios, which could hinder adaptability. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and make the policy set more adaptable to different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 61) SHOULD identify when legal queries contain emotional distress indicators and supplement factual resp...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST detect when legal queries contain insufficient contextual information and respond with structur...\n  - [3] (Score: 79) MUST automatically flag communications requesting evaluation of attorney conduct or legal malpractic...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
