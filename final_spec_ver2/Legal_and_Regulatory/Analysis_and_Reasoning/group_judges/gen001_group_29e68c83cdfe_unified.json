    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

confidentiality protections.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 2c32455e6b20, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and prompt for specific date ranges, statute of limitations periods, or regulatory effective dates before proceeding with substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 5f92692a730b, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and confidential client details before generating legal analysis responses.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: fa0e127ef272, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in tort liability analysis include explicit identification of intervening factors and alternative causation theories before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 14]

current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: de8d4d253c4f, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal document analysis when detecting potential attorney-client privileged content markers without first sanitizing or seeking clarification of document status.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 2f81ab67354b, Score:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize caution in legal analysis, confidentiality, and the need for clear jurisdictional and temporal context. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on avoiding unintended legal consequences and ensuring clarity in legal reasoning. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance areas, including confidentiality, jurisdictional clarity, and the avoidance of influencing legal outcomes. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as handling privileged information and ambiguous temporal references. However, there could be more foundational rules to balance the specific scenarios addressed.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 8 and 1, Specs 9 and 7, Specs 16 and 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation in real-world scenarios. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines for handling sensitive information and ensuring clarity in legal analysis. However, some rules are quite specific, which may limit their applicability across different contexts. The overall adaptability is good, but there is room for improvement in creating more broadly applicable rules.\n\nTOTAL=82",
