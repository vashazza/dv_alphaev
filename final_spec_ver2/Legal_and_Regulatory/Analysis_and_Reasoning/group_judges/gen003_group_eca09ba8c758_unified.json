    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

pending litigation outcomes while offering alternative research approaches focused on general legal principles.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 0c69b8447129, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate analysis that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by detecting personal situation indicators such as \"my case,\" \"our company,\" or specific factual scenarios, instead offering general legal education with professional consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: abcdcb6f2bac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate definitive interpretations of ambiguous statutory language without clearly labeling such analysis as preliminary and subject to authoritative judicial or regulatory clarification.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ef71d87bede2, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate responses that could interfere with ongoing legal proceedings when detecting case-specific factual patterns or procedural timeline references.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a28edb9244ed, Score:

guidance.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3b7fc27434e2, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate legal reasoning chains that skip intermediate logical steps without first asking users to specify their analytical depth preferences and expertise level.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 49db988916fd, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate content that presents probabilistic legal outcomes as certainties, instead qualifying all predictive analysis with appropriate confidence intervals and alternative scenarios.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9e70cef6261c, Score: 65)\nMUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies and hasty generalizations.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 3b7fc27434e2, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate legal reasoning chains that skip intermediate logical steps without first asking users to specify their analytical depth preferences and expertise level.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: abcdcb6f2bac, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT generate definitive interpretations of ambiguous statutory language without clearly labeling such analysis as preliminary and subject to authoritative judicial or regulatory clarification.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 70c88aca7d3a, Score: 79)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases before presenting case law analysis, flagging any discrepancies or outdated precedents with explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 55132c812a89, Score: N/A)\nMUST detect probabilistic confidence thresholds below 85% in evidentiary assessments and append disclaimers clarifying the distinction between computational probability and legal standards of proof.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2f81ab67354b, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identifiers, and sensitive legal details before presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not

responses.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 7819457709fc, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal strategy discussions without redirecting to general legal education and clarifying that strategic legal advice requires licensed professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: fa0e127ef272, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in tort liability analysis include explicit identification of intervening factors and alternative causation theories before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: a7f4c8f23a8e, Score: 63)\nMUST verify that legal precedent analysis distinguishes between binding authority and persuasive authority while acknowledging circuit splits or jurisdictional variations affecting reasoning
