    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

reasoning chains in tort liability analysis include explicit identification of intervening factors and alternative causation theories before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: a7f4c8f23a8e,

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on confidentiality, legal accuracy, and compliance. However, there are multiple instances of repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1, 2, 10, 18) that could have been consolidated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion. The logical connections between requirements are present, but the repetition suggests a lack of integration in the policy set.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice of law, and legal reasoning accuracy. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but the repetition of certain specs suggests a missed opportunity to address other critical compliance areas. The coverage is solid but not exhaustive.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple specs addressing the same issues (e.g., anonymizing confidential terms and masking personally identifiable information). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency and a need for consolidation to improve robustness without unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on practical implementation in real-world scenarios. However, the repetition of certain specs indicates a lack of flexibility and adaptability.
