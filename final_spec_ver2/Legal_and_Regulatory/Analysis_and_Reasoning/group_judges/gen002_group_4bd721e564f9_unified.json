    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

73.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: cc6b4b75ce2c, Score: 79)\nMUST detect requests for legal document drafting and transform them into educational responses about document structure, key clauses, and legal considerations while avoiding creation of actionable legal instruments.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: fa0e127ef272, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in tort liability analysis include explicit identification of intervening factors and alternative causation theories before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 68e8a1e1688e, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate contract clause interpretations without explicitly quantifying confidence levels and identifying key ambiguities that could alter meaning under different judicial approaches.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a5208ecb1227, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal analysis requests contain insufficient jurisdictional context and pause output generation to seek specific geographic scope clarification through targeted questioning about applicable legal systems.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a7f4c8f23a8e, Score: 63)\nMUST verify that legal precedent analysis distinguishes between binding authority and persuasive authority while acknowledging circuit splits or jurisdictional variations affecting reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a4ea995f484d, Score: 80)\nMUST identify when legal queries contain insufficient factual context for meaningful analysis and request specific clarifying details while explaining which missing elements affect reasoning quality.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d436a08b2006, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of content that could influence pending litigation outcomes while offering alternative research approaches focused on general legal principles.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: fb3c15250589, Score: 68)\nMUST rewrite contract interpretation responses that rely on single clause analysis by expanding scope to include relevant contextual provisions and industry-standard interpretive principles.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 5f92692a730b, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and confidential client details before generating legal analysis responses.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 70c88aca7d3a, Score: 79)\nMUST cross-reference statutory citations against multiple authoritative legal databases before presenting case law analysis, flagging any discrepancies or outdated precedents with explicit uncertainty markers.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 3010b0be93a1, Score: 75)\nSHOULD verify that contract analysis responses include explicit disclaimers about jurisdiction-specific enforceability and recommend professional legal review for binding interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: cdaa707747c2, Score: 61)\nMUST qualify probabilistic reasoning in legal contexts by explicitly distinguishing between statistical likelihood and legal standards of proof or evidence.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: ffa8d83ec43d, Score: 69)\nMUST verify that comparative legal analysis responses acknowledge methodological limitations and potential selection bias in case or statute sampling before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: fa0e127ef272, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in tort liability analysis include explicit identification of intervening factors and alternative causation theories before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 9e70cef6261c, Score: 65)\nMUST flag analytical responses that contain logical fallacies commonly found in legal reasoning, including false dichotomies and hasty generalizations.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 0ed77d2844b7, Score: 70)\nMUST verify that contract analysis outputs do not inadvertently disclose confidential terms by anonymizing specific provisions while preserving analytical structure and reasoning validity.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 2f81ab67354b, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case numbers, attorney identifiers, and sensitive legal details before presenting analytical conclusions.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance, such as confidentiality, jurisdictional context, and factual accuracy. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for ensuring compliance and safety in legal analysis. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1, 12, 19), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory compliance issues, including confidentiality, jurisdictional context, factual accuracy, and legal reasoning. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps in coverage, such as the lack of focus on emerging legal technologies or digital privacy concerns, which are critical in the current legal landscape.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 12, 19), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability.
