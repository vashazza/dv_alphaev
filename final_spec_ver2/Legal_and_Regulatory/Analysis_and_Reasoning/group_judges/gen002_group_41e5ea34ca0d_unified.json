    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Legal & Regulatory\n- Description:

analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d436a08b2006, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of content that could influence pending litigation outcomes while offering alternative research approaches focused on general legal principles.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 4da7387df99a, Score: 67)\nMUST maintain logical traceability by documenting each inferential step when building complex legal arguments from foundational principles to specific applications.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 369101a0226e, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate contract language or legal document text that could create unintended binding obligations, instead providing educational examples with clear non-enforceability disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ef71d87bede2,

statutory analysis conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9419ec3689fc, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate definitive causal attributions in legal outcome analysis without explicitly acknowledging confounding variables and alternative explanatory pathways.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b816839443e6, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal analysis when foundational jurisdictional context remains ambiguous, instead prompting for specific geographic and temporal scope clarification.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 5a500327fc60, Score: 75)\nSHOULD detect requests for legal reasoning that may involve

confidentiality protections.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 2c32455e6b20, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and prompt for specific date ranges, statute of limitations periods, or regulatory effective dates before proceeding with substantive responses.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 5f92692a730b, Score: 77)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, case participant names, and confidential client details before generating legal analysis responses.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: fa0e127ef272, Score: 75)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in tort liability analysis include explicit identification of intervening factors and alternative causation theories before presenting conclusions.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 7819457709fc, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal strategy discussions without redirecting to general legal education and clarifying that strategic legal advice requires licensed professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ade7e65ccf28, Score: 75)\nMUST quantify confidence levels and explicitly identify key uncertainties when generating contract interpretation or statutory analysis, particularly when multiple reasonable interpretations exist.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 5a500327fc60, Score: 75)\nSHOULD detect requests for legal reasoning that may involve privileged or confidential

users toward qualified counsel.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: cb35d7ddd324, Score: 76)\nSHOULD detect ambiguous temporal references in legal queries and request clarification about whether analysis concerns current law, historical legal standards, or prospective regulatory changes before proceeding with substantive reasoning.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: de8d4d253c4f, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT proceed with legal document analysis when detecting potential attorney-client privileged content markers without first sanitizing or seeking clarification of document status.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 2f81ab67354b, Score:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by covering different facets of legal analysis, such as causal reasoning, jurisdictional context, and confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 9 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including causal reasoning, jurisdictional clarity, confidentiality, and the need for professional legal advice. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as the handling of privileged information and ambiguous temporal references. There are no significant gaps in critical compliance areas, but the presence of repeated specifications suggests potential missed opportunities for broader coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 1, SPEC 9 and SPEC 7, SPEC 16 and SPEC 10). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictional requirements and confidentiality concerns. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=82",
