Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal analysis, such as jurisdictional context, confidentiality, and methodological transparency. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including confidentiality, jurisdiction, and methodological transparency. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as masking personally identifiable information and addressing jurisdictional ambiguities.

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of legal analysis, such as jurisdictional context, confidentiality, and methodological transparency. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including confidentiality, jurisdiction, and methodological transparency. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as masking personally identifiable information and addressing jurisdictional ambiguities. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or international legal frameworks.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9, SPEC 10 and SPEC 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, providing a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying jurisdictional requirements and confidentiality concerns. However, some specifications could be overly specific, which might limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) SHOULD automatically supplement legal analysis with methodological transparency notes explaining the...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case di...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate analysis that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by detecting personal ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
