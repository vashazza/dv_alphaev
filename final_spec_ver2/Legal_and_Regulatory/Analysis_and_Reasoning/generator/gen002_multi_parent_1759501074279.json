Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure the responsible generation of legal content, focusing on confidentiality, accuracy, and the avoidance of unauthorized legal practice.

Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and the accuracy of legal reasoning. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as masking personally identifiable information and handling ambiguous statutory language.

They collectively aim to ensure the responsible generation of legal content, focusing on confidentiality, accuracy, and the avoidance of unauthorized legal practice. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on anonymization, the need for professional consultation, and the careful handling of legal interpretations. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and the accuracy of legal reasoning. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as masking personally identifiable information and handling ambiguous statutory language. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or international legal variations.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules about anonymizing contract analysis outputs and masking personally identifiable information. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n• Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, emphasizing the need for professional consultation and the careful handling of legal content. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on anonymizing specific provisions, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case di...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
