Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for legal and regulatory compliance. They address various aspects of legal analysis, such as causal attributions, jurisdictional context, and confidentiality, without significant conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, including confidentiality, jurisdiction, and methodological transparency.

They address various aspects of legal analysis, such as causal attributions, jurisdictional context, and confidentiality, without significant conflicts. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal compliance issues, including confidentiality, jurisdiction, and methodological transparency. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as masking personally identifiable information and handling privileged content. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging legal technologies or international legal frameworks.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, with identical specifications appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 9, SPEC 10 and SPEC 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like confidentiality and jurisdiction. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could be overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios, which slightly impacts their practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) SHOULD automatically supplement legal analysis with methodological transparency notes explaining the...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case di...\n  - [3] (Score: 77) MUST NOT generate analysis that could constitute unauthorized practice of law by detecting personal ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
