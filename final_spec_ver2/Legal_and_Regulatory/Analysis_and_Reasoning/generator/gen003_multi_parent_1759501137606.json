Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure legal compliance and ethical considerations in LLM-generated content. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as avoiding unauthorized practice of law and ensuring confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 2, 3, and 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice of law, and accurate legal reasoning. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as masking personally identifiable information and handling ambiguous statutory language. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or international legal considerations..

They collectively aim to ensure legal compliance and ethical considerations in LLM-generated content. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as avoiding unauthorized practice of law and ensuring confidentiality. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 2, 3, and 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice of law, and accurate legal reasoning. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as masking personally identifiable information and handling ambiguous statutory language. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or international legal considerations.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 2, 3, and 16; Specs 11 and 8). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas, such as confidentiality and legal reasoning.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different legal contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on anonymizing specific provisions, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Overall, the policy set is implementable but could benefit from more broadly applicable rules.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 75) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in legal documents or case di...\n  - [2] (Score: 77) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security num...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including client names, case ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
