    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They collectively aim to ensure the responsible generation of legal content, focusing on confidentiality, accuracy, and the avoidance of unauthorized legal practice. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on anonymization, the need for professional consultation, and the careful handling of legal interpretations. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory risks, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and the accuracy of legal reasoning. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as masking personally identifiable information and handling ambiguous statutory language. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or international legal variations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules about anonymizing contract analysis outputs and masking personally identifiable information. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, emphasizing the need for professional consultation and the careful handling of legal content. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on anonymizing specific provisions, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
