    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of legal content generation, such as confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and logical reasoning. There are logical connections between the requirements, forming a coherent strategy for ensuring compliance and safety in legal content generation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 2, 3, and 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal compliance areas, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice, logical reasoning, and statutory interpretation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as masking personally identifiable information and distinguishing between binding and persuasive authority. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or international legal variations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with Specs 2, 3, and 16, which all address the anonymization of contract analysis outputs. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness without excessive overlap in other areas.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying levels of user expertise and different legal scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those focusing on anonymization, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
