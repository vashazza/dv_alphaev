    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of legal content generation. They complement each other by focusing on confidentiality, accuracy, and the avoidance of unauthorized legal practice. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2, 3, and 16), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of legal and regulatory concerns, including confidentiality, unauthorized practice, and accuracy in legal reasoning. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as handling ambiguous statutory language and probabilistic reasoning. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging legal technologies or international legal variations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2, 3, and 16). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas like confidentiality, the repetition of identical specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical aspects like anonymization and the need for professional consultation. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring cross-referencing with multiple databases, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all contexts."
