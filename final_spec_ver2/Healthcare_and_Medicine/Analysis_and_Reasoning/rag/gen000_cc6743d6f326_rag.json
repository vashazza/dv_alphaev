    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the importance of professional medical interpretation, crisis intervention, and educational content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 1) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are mostly clear, but some specs could be better integrated to enhance the overall strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including medical imaging, substance use disorders, infectious diseases, psychiatric emergencies, and privacy concerns. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some areas, such as chronic disease management or preventive care, are less emphasized. The balance between broad rules and specific protections is mostly maintained, but there are minor gaps in coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar specs appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 12, SPEC 16 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on converting medical advice into educational content and emphasizing professional consultation. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but there is room for improvement in creating more flexible, broadly applicable rules."
