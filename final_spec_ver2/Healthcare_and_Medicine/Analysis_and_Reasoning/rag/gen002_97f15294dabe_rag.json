    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical reasoning, diagnostic processes, and vulnerable populations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse, vulnerable populations, and diagnostic processes. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are some areas that could be more comprehensively addressed, such as general patient safety and broader healthcare scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and emphasize professional consultation, which is practical in real-world scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across diverse situations."
