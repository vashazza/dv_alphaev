    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes the limitations of AI in medical contexts and the necessity of professional medical interpretation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as prioritizing professional guidance and emergency resources. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, privacy, and the limitations of AI in diagnostics. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as psychiatric emergencies and rare diseases. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover general medical advice scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11, SPEC 16 and SPEC 7), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability by emphasizing professional consultation and emergency intervention. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on narrow scenarios like genetic conditions, which could limit adaptability."
