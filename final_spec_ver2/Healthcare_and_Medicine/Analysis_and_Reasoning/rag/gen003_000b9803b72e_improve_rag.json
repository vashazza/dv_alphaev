    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related AI applications. They collectively focus on ensuring professional oversight, prioritizing authoritative guidance, and safeguarding sensitive information. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including diagnostic reasoning, emergency situations, privacy, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for non-emergency chronic conditions or preventive care.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 12, SPEC 16 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing professional consultation and educational content. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts."
