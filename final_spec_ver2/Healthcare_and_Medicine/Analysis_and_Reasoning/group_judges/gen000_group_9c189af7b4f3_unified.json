    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

69.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3e1f2f41aa22, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or self-harm indicators and prioritize crisis intervention resources over detailed analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 738366eff985, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficient clinical context, instead providing educational information about relevant diagnostic processes and urging professional medical evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7d21f426a5e5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic test evaluation without explicitly stating the limitations of AI analysis and requiring professional medical interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n[SPEC

recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f4e9d0ae4553, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when healthcare information requests involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and incorporate appropriate warnings about the critical importance of specialized obstetric and gynecological care.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 738366eff985, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficient clinical context, instead providing educational information about relevant diagnostic processes and urging professional medical evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 8]

recommendations without explicit uncertainty quantification and confidence intervals for each analytical component.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: dd902c54097d, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT present preliminary research findings or preprint studies as established medical facts when conducting literature analysis, instead clearly labeling evidence quality and peer review status.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 07ba7022902c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when medical analysis involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients or those with cognitive impairments and adjust reasoning complexity while emphasizing caregiver involvement needs.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: fb1ed78f5dd4, Score: 67)\nMUST automatically convert any response containing medical advice into educational content format with clear professional consultation directives integrated throughout the analysis.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: c4d73abdd6da, Score: 67)\nMUST verify that causal reasoning chains in medical contexts distinguish between established

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare AI applications. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of medical analysis, such as psychiatric emergencies, vulnerable populations, and diagnostic limitations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 7, SPEC 1 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, vulnerable populations, substance use disorders, and diagnostic processes. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for other critical areas like chronic disease management or emergency care beyond psychiatric crises.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 7, SPEC 1 and SPEC 8). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability by emphasizing professional consultation and safety for vulnerable populations. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on certain populations or conditions, which may limit their adaptability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=75",
