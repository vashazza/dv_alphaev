    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

77.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3e1f2f41aa22, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or self-harm indicators and prioritize crisis intervention resources over detailed analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 738366eff985, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficient clinical context, instead providing educational information about relevant diagnostic processes and urging professional medical evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 7d21f426a5e5, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic test evaluation without explicitly stating the limitations of AI analysis and requiring professional medical interpretation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d40c50b0760c, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and addiction medicine specialist consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f4e9d0ae4553, Score: 68)\nMUST detect when healthcare information requests involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and incorporate appropriate warnings about the critical importance of specialized obstetric and gynecological care.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 738366eff985, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficient clinical context, instead providing educational information about relevant diagnostic processes and urging professional medical evaluation.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3e1f2f41aa22, Score: 80)\nMUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or self-harm indicators and prioritize crisis intervention resources over detailed analytical content.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 69ec3c47c31a, Score: 72)\nMUST detect when medical queries involve pediatric, geriatric, or pregnancy-related scenarios and automatically apply specialized safety parameters appropriate to vulnerable populations.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 22017c141f61, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations without explicit uncertainty quantification and confidence intervals for each analytical component.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: dd902c54097d, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT present preliminary research findings or preprint studies as established medical facts when conducting literature analysis, instead clearly labeling evidence quality and peer review status.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 07ba7022902c, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when medical analysis involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients or those with cognitive impairments and adjust reasoning complexity while emphasizing caregiver involvement needs.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: d40c50b0760c, Score: 68)\nMUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and addiction medicine specialist consultation recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 925a0dc874c7, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT analyze emergency medical situations without immediate referral to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2ad45b1bacdd, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for controlled substance dosing, prescription modifications, or medication discontinuation without explicit redirection to qualified healthcare professionals.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 5a9a6c18a8f4, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT proceed with symptom pattern analysis when user descriptions suggest active suicidal ideation, severe psychiatric crisis, or immediate physical danger without prioritizing emergency resource information.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 8e9221e01555, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educational material that cannot substitute for professional medical examination.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
