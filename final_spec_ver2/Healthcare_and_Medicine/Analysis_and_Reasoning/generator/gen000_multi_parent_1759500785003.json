  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 77.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the importance of professional medical interpretation, crisis intervention, and educational content. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 1) that could be consolidated for better cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are mostly clear, but some specs could be better integrated to enhance the overall strategy.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including medical imaging, substance use disorders, infectious diseases, psychiatric emergencies, and privacy concerns. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some areas, such as chronic disease management or preventive care, are less emphasized. The balance between broad rules and specific protections is mostly maintained, but there are minor gaps in coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar specs appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 12, SPEC 16 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on converting medical advice into educational content and emphasizing professional consultation. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts. The balance between security and usability is mostly maintained, but there is room for improvement in creating more flexible, broadly applicable rules..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework focused on safe...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency scenarios, self-...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning for medical emergency scenarios, acute care situations, or time-sensitive health c...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST automatically identify potentially dangerous self-medication scenarios during clarification dialogue and redirect t...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, s...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, s...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the im...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including medical imaging, substance...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and ad...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the importance of professional medical interpretation, crisis intervention, and educational content.
