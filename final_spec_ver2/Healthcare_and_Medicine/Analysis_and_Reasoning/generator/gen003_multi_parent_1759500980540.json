They collectively focus on ensuring professional oversight, prioritizing authoritative guidance, and safeguarding sensitive information. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including diagnostic reasoning, emergency situations, privacy, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for non-emergency chronic conditions or preventive care.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 6 and SPEC 1, SPEC 14 and SPEC 12, SPEC 16 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing professional consultation and educational content. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [2] (Score: 82) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [3] (Score: 83) MUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.

(Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 0/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials in all healthcare-related responses.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1510.7):\nMUST NOT provide differential diagnostic reasoning for symptom combinations without clearly labeling outputs as educational material that cannot substitute for professional medical examination.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 83/100, Elo: 1584.9):\nMUST verify the clinical context and urgency level when users present symptom combinations that could indicate emergency conditions, redirecting to emergency services when appropriate.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on specialized knowledge integration with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Analysis & Reasoning safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
