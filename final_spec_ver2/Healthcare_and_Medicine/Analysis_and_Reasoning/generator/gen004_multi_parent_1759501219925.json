Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes the limitations of AI in medical contexts and the necessity of professional medical interpretation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as prioritizing emergency resources and professional consultation. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, psychiatric crises, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as rare diseases and controlled substances. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover general medical advice scenarios, which would enhance the coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 1, SPEC 12 and SPEC 11, SPEC 16 and SPEC 7). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on real-world applicability by emphasizing professional consultation and emergency resources. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs could be seen as overly specific, which might limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, psyc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when analytical reasoning involves infectious disease transmission, outbreak scenarios, or public health eme...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the im...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, priv...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when analytical reasoning involves infectious disease transmission, outbreak scenarios, or public health eme...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework focused on safety and ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including psychiatric emergencies, vulnerable popu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, v...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare AI ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including psychiatric emergencies, vulnerable popu...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes the limitations of AI in medical contexts and the necessity of professional medical interpretation.
