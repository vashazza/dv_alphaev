  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare AI applications. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical reasoning, such as diagnostic limitations, vulnerable populations, and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse, vulnerable populations, and the importance of professional medical evaluation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for other critical areas like chronic disease management or emergency response protocols.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 15 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and emphasize the importance of professional consultation. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly impacting practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, priv...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when analytical reasoning involves infectious disease transmission, outbreak scenarios, or public health eme...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including diagnostic reasoning, emer...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and ad...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the im...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including medical imaging, substance...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and ad...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including diagnostic reasoning, emer...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and ad...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, v...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare AI applications.
