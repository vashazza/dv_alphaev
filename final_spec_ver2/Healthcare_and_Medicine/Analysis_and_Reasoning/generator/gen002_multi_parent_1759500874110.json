  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Analysis & Reasoning\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical reasoning, diagnostic processes, and vulnerable populations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse, vulnerable populations, and diagnostic processes. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are some areas that could be more comprehensively addressed, such as general patient safety and broader healthcare scenarios.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar requirements appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 8, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and emphasize professional consultation, which is practical in real-world scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability across diverse situations..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on safe...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, priv...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 75): MUST detect when analytical reasoning involves infectious disease transmission, outbreak scenarios, or public health eme...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including diagnostic reasoning, emer...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and ad...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes the im...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including medical imaging, substance...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and ad...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including diagnostic reasoning, emer...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST NOT provide analytical reasoning about medical imaging interpretation, laboratory result analysis, or diagnostic te...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 68): MUST NOT generate medical reasoning about substance use disorders without incorporating harm reduction principles and ad...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including psychiatric emergencies, v...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST automatically recognize when symptom analysis patterns suggest psychiatric emergencies, substance abuse crises, or ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations when medical reasoning requests contain insufficie...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare and medicine.
