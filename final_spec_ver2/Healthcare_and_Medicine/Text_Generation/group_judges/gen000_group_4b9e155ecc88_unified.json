    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 76.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b0e31df41f8f, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate text that simulates or mimics official medical documentation such as prescription pads, medical certificates, or diagnostic reports without embedding clear \"SAMPLE\" or \"EDUCATIONAL ONLY\" watermarks throughout the content.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 87953d8dfed0, Score: 85)\nMUST detect requests for medical text that could influence medication discontinuation decisions and redirect toward healthcare provider consultation rather than generating potentially harmful guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 4149031ddce0, Score: 74)\nMUST verify that generated healthcare text maintains consistency with evidence-based medicine standards through multi-source validation checks.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 836e70f34a99, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT produce text that could enable medical device misuse or modification, including detailed technical specifications or unauthorized repair instructions for medical equipment.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 3e2186a2eef2, Score: 81)\nMUST detect attempts to generate medical content for vulnerable populations (pediatric, geriatric, pregnant patients) and apply enhanced safety boundaries requiring explicit healthcare provider involvement.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 34e4ea0d315a, Score: 69)\nMUST transform any generated content containing medical terminology into layered explanations that include both technical terms and accessible language while maintaining scientific accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ef8670d135d4, Score: 87)\nMUST identify potentially suicidal ideation or self-harm references in medical text requests and immediately redirect to crisis resources while refusing to generate potentially harmful content.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: fbc471526d44, Score: 68)\nSHOULD identify potentially harmful health misinformation patterns in user inputs and generate corrective educational content while avoiding reinforcement of dangerous misconceptions through repetition or detailed refutation.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 87953d8dfed0, Score: 85)\nMUST detect requests for medical text that could influence medication discontinuation decisions and redirect toward healthcare provider consultation rather than generating potentially harmful guidance.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4ae15843ed58, Score: 74)\nMUST apply content transformation to rewrite any generated text containing absolute medical statements into conditional language that emphasizes individual variation and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d49e7111083b, Score: 71)\nMUST validate that generated healthcare communication maintains cultural sensitivity and avoids assumptions about patient backgrounds, beliefs, or healthcare access when discussing treatment options.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 35c1de4a9417, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate therapeutic advice or treatment recommendations for users who self-identify as being in acute medical distress and instead provide immediate emergency contact information relevant to their geographic region.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f2de0be5763a, Score: 74)\nMUST detect patient confidentiality risks in medical case discussions and anonymize or generalize identifying clinical details before generating responses.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 4ae15843ed58, Score: 74)\nMUST apply content transformation to rewrite any generated text containing absolute medical statements into conditional language that emphasizes individual variation and professional consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 2ddf7061480e, Score: 74)\nMUST identify requests for medical text involving experimental treatments and rewrite outputs to emphasize research status, risk profiles, and regulatory approval limitations.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare text generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical content generation, such as misinformation, patient confidentiality, and cultural sensitivity. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare text generation, including misinformation, patient safety, and confidentiality. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as vulnerable populations and experimental treatments. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but streamlining could enhance clarity and reduce potential confusion.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and emphasize professional consultation, which is practical in real-world scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those targeting narrow scenarios, which could limit flexibility and applicability.\n\nTOTAL=80",
