    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related text generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to appropriate resources and ensuring content accuracy. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13) that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, mental health, medication information, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling controlled substances and genetic counseling. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover other potential gaps, such as data privacy or broader ethical considerations.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with SPEC 10 and SPEC 13 being identical, and SPEC 2 and SPEC 14 addressing the same issue of temporal accuracy. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to appropriate resources and ensuring content accuracy. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are quite specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly impacting practicality."
