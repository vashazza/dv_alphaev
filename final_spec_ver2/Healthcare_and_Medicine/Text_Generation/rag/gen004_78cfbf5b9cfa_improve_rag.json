    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework that prioritizes user safety and compliance with healthcare standards. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring content accuracy. However, some specs are repeated (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including emergency situations, mental health crises, medication information, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling controlled substances and genetic counseling. However, there could be more emphasis on general rules to avoid over-reliance on specific scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13, SPEC 2 and SPEC 14), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to appropriate resources and maintaining content accuracy. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, which may limit adaptability to different contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
