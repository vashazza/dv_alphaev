    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes user safety and compliance. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of healthcare content generation, such as emergency situations, medication information, and mental health crises. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, particularly in the handling of prompt injection attempts and disclaimers, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas such as emergency response, medication safety, and mental health. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine, which could enhance the coverage.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated emphasis on disclaimers and prompt injection attempts. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to appropriate resources and maintaining safety. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring credential validation for dosage calculations, which may be challenging to implement consistently. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
