    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related text generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring content accuracy. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including emergency situations, mental health crises, medication information, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated to enhance coverage efficiency.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13, SPEC 2 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to appropriate resources and maintaining content accuracy. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
