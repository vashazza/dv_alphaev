    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, evidence-based practices, and user protection. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to healthcare providers and ensuring content accuracy. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including misinformation, patient confidentiality, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling suicidal ideation and experimental treatments. There are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific guidance on digital health data security.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with Spec 9 being identical to Spec 2 and Spec 14 being identical to Spec 10. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring layered explanations for all medical terminology, which may not always be practical."
