Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety, evidence-based practices, and user protection. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to healthcare providers and ensuring content accuracy. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including misinformation, patient confidentiality, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling suicidal ideation and experimental treatments.

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to healthcare providers and ensuring content accuracy. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including misinformation, patient confidentiality, and vulnerable populations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling suicidal ideation and experimental treatments. There are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific guidance on digital health data security.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with Spec 9 being identical to Spec 2 and Spec 14 being identical to Spec 10. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. The specs are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring layered explanations for all medical terminology, which may not always be practical.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 68) SHOULD identify potentially harmful health misinformation patterns in user inputs and generate corre...\n  - [2] (Score: 73) MUST NOT generate medical content that could undermine established public health measures or vaccina...\n  - [3] (Score: 87) MUST identify potentially suicidal ideation or self-harm references in medical text requests and imm...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
