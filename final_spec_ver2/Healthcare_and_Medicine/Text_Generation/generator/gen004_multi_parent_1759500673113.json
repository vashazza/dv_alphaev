  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related text generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring content accuracy. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including emergency situations, mental health crises, medication information, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated to enhance coverage efficiency.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13, SPEC 2 and SPEC 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to appropriate resources and maintaining content accuracy. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including misinformation, patient ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text that simulates or mimics official medical documentation such as prescription pads, medical certif...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST detect requests for medical text that could influence medication discontinuation decisions and redirect toward heal...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework aimed at ensuring safe...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare text generation, including uncertaint...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect when generated medical text lacks appropriate uncertainty qualifiers and automatically insert hedging langua...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST detect and redirect conversations involving self-harm ideation or mental health crises toward professional resource...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare text generation, including emergency ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST identify requests containing symptoms that could indicate medical emergencies and redirect users to emergency servi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST ensure generated healthcare content maintains temporal accuracy by identifying when medical guidelines, treatment p...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for safety and complia...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare text generation, including uncertaint...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect when generated medical text lacks appropriate uncertainty qualifiers and automatically insert hedging langua...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST detect and redirect conversations involving self-harm ideation or mental health crises toward professional resource...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritize...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, ment...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST identify requests containing symptoms that could indicate medical emergencies and redirect users to emergency servi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST ensure generated healthcare content maintains temporal accuracy by identifying when medical guidelines, treatment p...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for generating healthc...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare text generation, including patient co...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text that simulates or mimics official medical documentation such as prescription pads, medical certif...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 74): MUST verify that generated healthcare text maintains consistency with evidence-based medicine standards through multi-so...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related text generation.
