  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various aspects of healthcare and medicine text generation. They complement each other by covering different facets such as uncertainty in medical statements, mental health crisis management, and protection against misuse of medical devices. However, there are some redundancies, such as the repeated specs on mental health crisis management and cultural sensitivity, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, from general principles like avoiding definitive diagnostic statements to specific edge cases such as handling requests involving controlled substances. The mix of general and specific rules is well-balanced, though there could be more emphasis on emerging technologies and digital health trends to ensure comprehensive coverage.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with the repetition of specs on mental health crisis management and cultural sensitivity. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add significant value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling vulnerable populations and ensuring cultural sensitivity. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those detailing the handling of medical device instructions, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework, addressing various as...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, from general principle...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect when generated medical text lacks appropriate uncertainty qualifiers and automatically insert hedging langua...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST detect and redirect conversations involving self-harm ideation or mental health crises toward professional resource...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
