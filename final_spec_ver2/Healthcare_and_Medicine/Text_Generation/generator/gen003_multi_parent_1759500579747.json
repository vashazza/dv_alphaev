  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Text Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related text generation. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as redirecting users to appropriate resources and ensuring content accuracy. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 13) that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency situations, mental health, medication information, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling controlled substances and genetic counseling. However, there could be more foundational rules to cover other potential gaps, such as data privacy or broader ethical considerations.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, notably with SPEC 10 and SPEC 13 being identical, and SPEC 2 and SPEC 14 addressing the same issue of temporal accuracy. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to appropriate resources and ensuring content accuracy. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are quite specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly impacting practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including emergency situations, me...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST identify requests containing symptoms that could indicate medical emergencies and redirect users to emergency servi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST ensure generated healthcare content maintains temporal accuracy by identifying when medical guidelines, treatment p...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including emergency situations, me...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 86): MUST identify requests containing symptoms that could indicate medical emergencies and redirect users to emergency servi...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 71): MUST ensure generated healthcare content maintains temporal accuracy by identifying when medical guidelines, treatment p...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including misinformation, patient ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text that simulates or mimics official medical documentation such as prescription pads, medical certif...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST detect requests for medical text that could influence medication discontinuation decisions and redirect toward heal...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare text generation, including misinforma...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST NOT generate text that simulates or mimics official medical documentation such as prescription pads, medical certif...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 85): MUST detect requests for medical text that could influence medication discontinuation decisions and redirect toward heal...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, balancing general prin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect when generated medical text lacks appropriate uncertainty qualifiers and automatically insert hedging langua...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST detect and redirect conversations involving self-harm ideation or mental health crises toward professional resource...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for safety and complia...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare text generation, including uncertaint...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST detect when generated medical text lacks appropriate uncertainty qualifiers and automatically insert hedging langua...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 83): MUST detect and redirect conversations involving self-harm ideation or mental health crises toward professional resource...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related text generation.
