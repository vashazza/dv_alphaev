    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They emphasize safety, consultation, and verification, which are logically connected and complement each other. However, there are some repeated themes, such as the focus on vulnerable populations and controlled substances, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including oncology, vulnerable populations, cultural considerations, and controlled substances. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications addressing vulnerable populations and controlled substances, which appear multiple times. While redundancy can enhance safety, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and compliance. They are adaptable to various contexts and balance security with usability. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed statistical confidence bounds, which may be challenging to implement consistently."
