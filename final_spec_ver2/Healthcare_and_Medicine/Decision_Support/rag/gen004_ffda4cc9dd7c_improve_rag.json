    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize the importance of safety, professional consultation, and the use of authoritative data sources. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, such as multiple specs addressing vulnerable populations and controlled substances, which could be streamlined for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including oncology, vulnerable populations, cultural considerations, and controlled substances. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there is some repetition in addressing vulnerable populations and controlled substances. Overall, it provides comprehensive coverage of the domain's risk landscape.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specs addressing similar issues like vulnerable populations and controlled substances. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and compliance. They are designed to be adaptable to various contexts, though some specs are overly specific, which could hinder practical implementation. The emphasis on professional consultation and authoritative data sources supports usability and adaptability."
