  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Decision Support\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: Improving a spec in a 20-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare decision support. They complement each other by covering different domains such as mental health, reproductive health, and controlled substances, and they collectively contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including experimental treatments, mental health crises, controlled substances, and end-of-life care. The mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections is well-balanced, though there could be more emphasis on general rules to avoid over-reliance on specific scenarios. Overall, the coverage is comprehensive, with only minor gaps in addressing some niche areas..

They complement each other by covering different domains such as mental health, reproductive health, and controlled substances, and they collectively contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including experimental treatments, mental health crises, controlled substances, and end-of-life care. The mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections is well-balanced, though there could be more emphasis on general rules to avoid over-reliance on specific scenarios. Overall, the coverage is comprehensive, with only minor gaps in addressing some niche areas.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, such as repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 8, SPEC 17 and SPEC 18) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain specifications suggests a need for streamlining to avoid unnecessary duplication.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, though some rules are overly specific and could be challenging to implement in narrow scenarios. The focus on flexible, broadly applicable rules is commendable, but there is room for improvement in ensuring all specifications are practical in real-world settings.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 77) MUST identify healthcare decision support requests that involve reproductive health, mental health c...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and he...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and autom...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
