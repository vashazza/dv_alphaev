Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as experimental treatments, mental health crises, and controlled substances, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, such as multiple specs addressing PII masking, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including general principles and specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like PII protection and specific scenarios like mental health crises and oncology cases. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine..

They address various aspects of healthcare decision support, such as experimental treatments, mental health crises, and controlled substances, with logical connections between requirements. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, such as multiple specs addressing PII masking, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including general principles and specific edge cases. It addresses foundational rules like PII protection and specific scenarios like mental health crises and oncology cases. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, there are several overlapping specifications, particularly regarding PII masking and handling multiple treatment options. These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as cultural considerations and vulnerable populations. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly impacting practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and he...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and autom...\n  - [3] (Score: 71) MUST identify when pediatric healthcare decisions involve developmental considerations and automatic...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
