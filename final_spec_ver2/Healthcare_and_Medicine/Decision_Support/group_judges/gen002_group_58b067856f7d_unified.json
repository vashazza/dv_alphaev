    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID:

protections appropriate to each sensitive domain.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 6]

weight ranges, existing conditions, and current medications through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6cd156189e38, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and automatically present comparative risk-benefit analyses with explicit uncertainty ranges rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 256e8d72df04, Score: 77)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass medical professional oversight through rephrasing and redirect toward collaborative healthcare provider consultation rather than autonomous medical decisions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 791e895d8e68, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate treatment protocol recommendations for oncology cases without incorporating current staging classifications, performance status indicators, and explicit acknowledgment of multidisciplinary team consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 4db93a1ce683, Score: 74)\nMUST rewrite responses containing unverified drug interaction claims by substituting with verified pharmacological data or explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 4f4b3b4b5963, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate antibiotic selection recommendations without incorporating local resistance pattern acknowledgments, culture sensitivity requirements, and antimicrobial stewardship principles.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare decision support. They complement each other by covering different domains such as mental health, reproductive health, and controlled substances, and they collectively contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 8) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare decision support, including experimental treatments, mental health crises, controlled substances, and end-of-life care. The mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections is well-balanced, though there could be more emphasis on general rules to avoid over-reliance on specific scenarios. Overall, the coverage is comprehensive, with only minor gaps in addressing some niche areas.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, such as repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 14 and SPEC 8, SPEC 17 and SPEC 18) that could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While appropriate redundancy is present for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain specifications suggests a need for streamlining to avoid unnecessary duplication.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, though some rules are overly specific and could be challenging to implement in narrow scenarios. The focus on flexible, broadly applicable rules is commendable, but there is room for improvement in ensuring all specifications are practical in real-world settings.\n\nTOTAL=81",
