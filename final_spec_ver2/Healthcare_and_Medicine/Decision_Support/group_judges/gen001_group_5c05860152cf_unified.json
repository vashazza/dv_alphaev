    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

off-label treatments and automatically surface FDA approval status, clinical trial data availability, and informed consent considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: d98053a2718e, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically recognize when healthcare queries involve mental health crisis indicators and rewrite responses to prioritize immediate safety resources while maintaining therapeutic rapport.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 5d63bdf62eb8, Score: 77)\nMUST identify healthcare decision support requests that involve reproductive health, mental health crisis, or substance abuse and apply specialized professional boundary protections appropriate to each sensitive domain.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: d1598f8412b6, Score: 79)\nMUST validate all medical procedure information against current clinical practice guidelines from relevant specialty organizations, replacing outdated techniques with contemporary standards or explicit temporal qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: b941797e40a5, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for end-of-life care decisions without incorporating palliative care consultation pathways and explicit acknowledgment of ethical complexity requiring multidisciplinary input.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 4c6e9682af74, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate decision support responses for medication queries without first confirming patient age, weight ranges, existing conditions, and current medications through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 6cd156189e38, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and automatically present comparative risk-benefit analyses with explicit uncertainty ranges rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 256e8d72df04, Score: 77)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass medical professional oversight through rephrasing and redirect toward collaborative healthcare provider consultation rather than autonomous medical decisions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 791e895d8e68, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate treatment protocol recommendations for oncology cases without incorporating current staging classifications, performance status indicators, and explicit acknowledgment of multidisciplinary team consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 4db93a1ce683, Score: 74)\nMUST rewrite responses containing unverified drug interaction claims by substituting with verified pharmacological data or explicit uncertainty acknowledgments.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 4f4b3b4b5963, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT generate antibiotic selection recommendations without incorporating local resistance pattern acknowledgments, culture sensitivity requirements, and antimicrobial stewardship principles.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID:

PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials in all decision support outputs.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 944c583efd26, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect when healthcare decision queries involve cultural or religious considerations and automatically incorporate culturally sensitive clarification questions about treatment preferences and belief system accommodations.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device recommendations to include FDA approval status, recall history, and comparative effectiveness research when available.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 965ed625cb38, Score: 73)\nMUST detect requests involving vulnerable populations (pregnant patients, elderly, immunocompromised) and apply enhanced verification protocols with population-specific safety parameters before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 1aa7123b9104, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and contact information in all healthcare decision support responses while preserving clinically relevant demographic data.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment:
