    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

without incorporating current staging classifications, performance status indicators, and explicit acknowledgment of multidisciplinary team consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 816c0c4ac737, Score: 80)\nSHOULD detect when healthcare decision support requests contain insufficient clinical context and prompt for essential missing parameters rather than generating potentially unsafe recommendations based on incomplete data.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 19a0ec4fdc75, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when users request medical advice for vulnerable populations including pediatric, geriatric, or pregnant patients and enhance safety warnings with specialized consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e13be3703462, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations without first transforming definitive language into probabilistic assessments with explicit uncertainty quantification and statistical confidence bounds.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 944c583efd26,

preferences and belief system accommodations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 33d8bbd33da5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when medical decision requests involve experimental or off-label treatments and automatically surface FDA approval status, clinical trial data availability, and informed consent considerations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device recommendations to include FDA approval status, recall history, and comparative effectiveness research when available.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3ca52ce4bcd4, Score: 83)\nMUST detect requests for decision support involving controlled substances and apply enhanced verification protocols while redirecting toward appropriate medical supervision channels.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 19a0ec4fdc75, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when users request medical advice for vulnerable populations including pediatric, geriatric, or pregnant patients and enhance safety warnings with specialized consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 965ed625cb38, Score: 73)\nMUST detect requests involving vulnerable populations (pregnant patients, elderly, immunocompromised) and apply enhanced verification protocols with population-specific safety parameters before response generation.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: e9926848bf9c, Score: 76)\nMUST detect attempts to extract specific dosing calculations or drug interaction matrices and transform these into educational frameworks requiring clinical validation rather than actionable prescribing data.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 256e8d72df04, Score: 77)\nMUST detect attempts to bypass medical professional oversight through rephrasing and redirect toward collaborative healthcare provider consultation rather than autonomous medical decisions.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device recommendations to include FDA approval status, recall history, and comparative effectiveness research when available.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: e13be3703462, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations without

culturally sensitive clarification questions about treatment preferences and belief system accommodations.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 11ef5f80df33, Score: 73)\nMUST rewrite responses containing medical device

While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability.
