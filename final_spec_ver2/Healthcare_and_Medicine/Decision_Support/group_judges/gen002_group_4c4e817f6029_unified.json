    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

83.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 33d8bbd33da5, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when medical decision requests involve experimental or off-label treatments and automatically surface FDA approval status, clinical trial data availability, and informed consent considerations.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: b800d55f4083, Score: 81)\nMUST initiate enhanced verification sequences when decision support requests involve controlled substances, systematically confirming legitimate medical contexts and addiction risk factors through careful questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: b941797e40a5, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT provide decision support for end-of-life care decisions without incorporating palliative care consultation pathways and explicit acknowledgment of ethical complexity requiring multidisciplinary input.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 4c6e9682af74, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate decision support responses for medication queries without first confirming patient age, weight ranges, existing conditions, and current medications through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 6cd156189e38, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and automatically present comparative risk-benefit analyses with explicit uncertainty ranges rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: eccd5d24f920, Score: 87)\nSHOULD NOT generate decision support for psychiatric medication management without incorporating validated screening criteria and explicit referral pathways to licensed mental health professionals.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 7198c19990f2, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate pediatric healthcare decision support without first confirming through dialogue the child's age, developmental stage, and parental consent for information sharing.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 7aa1cc212e72, Score: 94)\nMUST NOT generate decision support recommendations for life-threatening medical emergencies and instead redirect users to emergency medical services while preserving any critical symptom information provided.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: ae744d95375b, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and healthcare provider credentials before generating any decision support content.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 8734326bf7cf, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations that could substitute for licensed healthcare provider judgment, instead reframing such requests as educational information with explicit professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6cd156189e38, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when healthcare decision requests involve multiple competing treatment options and automatically present comparative risk-benefit analyses with explicit uncertainty ranges rather than singular recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: dac983484c43, Score: 84)\nMUST verify medical decision support responses against multiple authoritative clinical databases and append uncertainty indicators when source consensus falls below established thresholds before content delivery.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: dac983484c43, Score: 84)\nMUST verify medical decision support responses against multiple authoritative clinical databases and append uncertainty indicators when source consensus falls below established thresholds before content delivery.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 60d14ed943c9, Score: 84)\nMUST verify drug allergy and contraindication information against current pharmaceutical safety databases before presenting any medication-related decision support, masking uncertain interactions with explicit warnings.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 8734326bf7cf, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions

advisories.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 3ca52ce4bcd4, Score: 83)\nMUST detect requests for decision support involving controlled substances and apply enhanced verification protocols while redirecting toward appropriate medical supervision channels.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: e13be3703462, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations without first transforming definitive language into probabilistic assessments with explicit uncertainty quantification and statistical confidence bounds.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: e13be3703462, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations without first transforming definitive language into probabilistic assessments with explicit uncertainty quantification and statistical confidence bounds.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID:

They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as experimental treatments, controlled substances, and pediatric care.

It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are some areas, such as chronic disease management or preventive care, that could be more explicitly addressed to enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 5, SPEC 13 and SPEC 12, SPEC 15 and SPEC 10). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability.
