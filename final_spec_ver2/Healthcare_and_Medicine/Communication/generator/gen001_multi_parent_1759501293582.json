  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 17-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare communication. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on safety warnings and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 7 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interactions, mental health crises, emergency protocols, and reproductive health. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on chronic disease management or pediatric care, which are also important in healthcare.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar specs appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1, SPEC 8, and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring safety. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts. For example, the focus on reproductive health could be more broadly applicable if integrated with general health communication strategies..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of topics relevant to healthcare communication, including end-of-life...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care r...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): SHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of topics relevant to healthcare communication, including end-of-life...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care r...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): SHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptio...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare communication. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on safety warnings and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 7 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n• Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interactions, mental health crises, emergency protocols, and reproductive health. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, but there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on chronic disease management or pediatric care, which are also important in healthcare.\n• Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar specs appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 1, SPEC 8, and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated for efficiency.\n• Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring safety. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific and may not be adaptable to all contexts. For example, the focus on reproductive health could be more broadly applicable if integrated with general health communication strategies.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 87) MUST NOT provide specific medication dosages, treatment protocols, or diagnostic interpretations wit...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST detect medical advice-seeking disguised through hypothetical scenarios, academic framing, or th...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST identify requests for medical procedure descriptions that could enable self-treatment or amateu...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
