Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare communication. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on safety warnings and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interactions, mental health crises, emergency protocols, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been consolidated to improve coverage efficiency.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated or overlapping requirements, such as those related to drug interaction information and reproductive health. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent here suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules, such as repeated emphasis on certain health conditions, could limit broader applicability and flexibility..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 63/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally aim to ensure safe and informed communication in healthcare, focusing on drug in...\n💬 Coverage: The policy group covers a range of important areas in healthcare communication, such as drug interac...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 63/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs show some level of cohesion, particularly in addressing drug interactions, reproductive he...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication risks, including drug interactions, repro...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 70): SHOULD recognize when medical discussions involve pregnancy, fertility, or reproductive health and automatically include...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare communication.
