  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Communication\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 18-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare communication. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on safety warnings and the need for professional consultation. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 7 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interactions, mental health crises, emergency protocols, and privacy concerns. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on non-emergency chronic conditions or preventive care, which are also important in healthcare communication.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 4, SPEC 7 and SPEC 11, SPEC 8 and SPEC 12). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on safety and compliance. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing narrowly on reproductive health, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for healthcare communi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication scenarios, from end-of-life care to menta...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 74): MUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care r...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 78): SHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptio...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for healthcare communi...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections.
