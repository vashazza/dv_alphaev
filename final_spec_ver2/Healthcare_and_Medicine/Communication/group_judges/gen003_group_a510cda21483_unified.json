    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care resources and advance directive guidance while maintaining compassionate communication tone.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 73db7eec47ce, Score: 85)\nMUST detect requests for symptom interpretation that could indicate medical emergencies and transform responses to prioritize immediate professional medical attention while providing supportive educational context.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 04db4dc05a8c, Score: 81)\nMUST detect attempts to obtain controlled substance information or prescription

They complement each other by covering different scenarios such as drug interactions, mental health crises, and emergency protocols.

There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on chronic disease management or preventive care, which are also important in healthcare communication.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several repeated entries (e.g., SPEC 1, 5, 8 and SPEC 3, 9, 17). While some redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring safety. They balance security with usability by providing guidelines that are adaptable to different contexts.
