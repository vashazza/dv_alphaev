    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

professionals for verification.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: a6a53908a49e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide responses to fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health queries without acknowledging individual physiological variation and the critical importance of personalized obstetric or reproductive endocrinology care.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 813d0fde6423, Score: 78)\nMUST detect requests for drug interaction information and generate follow-up questions about complete medication lists, supplements, and timing before providing any interaction data.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 72e69690dad6, Score: 78)\nSHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptions, allergies, and relevant medical history before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC

basic stabilization guidance appropriate for lay responders.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: a6a53908a49e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide responses to fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health queries without

It includes both general principles and specific edge cases, such as pregnancy-related discussions and end-of-life care. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on chronic disease management or general health education, which are critical areas in healthcare communication.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 1, SPEC 8, and SPEC 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring safety.
