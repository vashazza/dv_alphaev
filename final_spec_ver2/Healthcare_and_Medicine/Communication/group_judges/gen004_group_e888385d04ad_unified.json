    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on safety and compliance in healthcare communication. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, 7 and SPEC 3, 6, 11, 12), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The specs do complement each other in terms of addressing different aspects of healthcare communication, but the repetition indicates a lack of integration.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication risks, including drug interactions, mental health, end-of-life care, and controlled substances. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but the repeated focus on certain areas (e.g., reproductive health) suggests potential gaps in other critical areas like chronic disease management or pediatric care.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of identical or nearly identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1, 4, 7 and SPEC 3, 6, 11, 12). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the level here is excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. However, the repetition of certain specs and the specificity of some rules (e.g., SPEC 3, 6, 11, 12) could hinder adaptability and implementation in diverse contexts. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=73",
