    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specs generally aim to ensure safe and informed communication in healthcare contexts, focusing on drug interactions, reproductive health, and sensitive topics like self-harm and end-of-life care. However, there are multiple instances of identical or nearly identical specs (e.g., Specs 2, 4, 15, 16 and Specs 5, 8, 17), which suggests a lack of integration and coordination. This repetition indicates potential conflicts or confusion in implementation, reducing overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The policy group covers a broad range of critical areas, including drug interactions, reproductive health, mental health, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as self-harm and controlled substances. However, the focus on reproductive health is disproportionately high, which may leave other areas underrepresented. The group could benefit from more diverse coverage of healthcare communication risks.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=10  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, with several specs repeated verbatim or with minimal variation (e.g., Specs 1, 6, 9 and Specs 13, 14). While some redundancy can enhance robustness, the extent here suggests inefficiency and potential confusion. Consolidating these specs could streamline the policy set without losing critical safety measures.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=15  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, focusing on practical measures like prompting for additional information and redirecting to resources. However, the repetition of specific rules, particularly those related to reproductive health, may complicate implementation and maintenance. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance adaptability and usability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=63",
