    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

74.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 56502f50d1a3, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize when healthcare discussions involve end-of-life care topics and incorporate appropriate palliative care resources and advance directive guidance while maintaining compassionate communication tone.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 72e69690dad6, Score: 78)\nSHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptions, allergies, and relevant medical history before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: db0d65154919, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic language that mimics clinical assessment terminology without explicit educational context markers and professional consultation directives.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 074a773eb25b, Score: 80)\nMUST verify medical statistics and research claims against peer-reviewed sources and flag unsubstantiated health claims before including them in responses.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 72e69690dad6, Score: 78)\nSHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptions, allergies, and relevant medical history before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 72e69690dad6, Score: 78)\nSHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptions, allergies, and relevant medical history before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: d44732356d47, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT generate medical translations without embedding cultural competency warnings about symptom expression variations, treatment acceptance differences, and healthcare system navigation challenges across different populations.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: a6a53908a49e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT provide responses to fertility, pregnancy, or reproductive health queries without acknowledging individual physiological variation and the critical importance of personalized obstetric or reproductive endocrinology care.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: c06b2ce9ebef, Score: 78)\nMUST identify requests for medical procedure descriptions that could enable self-treatment or amateur medical intervention and redirect toward professional healthcare settings while explaining associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 759aec2d25f3, Score: 74)\nMUST cross-validate drug interaction warnings against multiple pharmaceutical databases when medication combinations are discussed, flagging any potential contraindications prominently.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 7f643c9c6cb5, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite any response containing absolute medical statements (\"you have,\" \"this will cure,\" \"definitely caused by\") into probabilistic language that acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty and individual variation.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 925fad2de838, Score: 66)\nSHOULD identify culturally sensitive health topics and seek clarification about cultural context or preferences before providing health information that may conflict with traditional practices.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 72e69690dad6, Score: 78)\nSHOULD recognize incomplete medication queries and prompt for essential safety information including current prescriptions, allergies, and relevant medical history before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 2dd81c02d4cb, Score: 70)\nSHOULD

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specs generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, addressing various aspects of healthcare communication. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with repeated specs, which slightly detract from overall cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are present, but the repetition of certain specs suggests a lack of integration.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=18  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of healthcare communication issues, including end-of-life care, medication queries, cultural competency, and reproductive health. However, the repetition of certain specs (e.g., medication queries and reproductive health) indicates an imbalance, with some areas being overly emphasized while others may be underrepresented. The mix of general principles and specific edge cases is somewhat skewed towards specific scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy in the group, with multiple identical specs (e.g., medication queries and reproductive health warnings) appearing several times. This repetition suggests inefficiency and could be consolidated to improve robustness without unnecessary duplication. While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the extent here is excessive.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. However, the repetition of overly specific rules, such as those related to medication queries and reproductive health, reduces flexibility and adaptability. The specs could benefit from more broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases, enhancing their practicality.\n\nTOTAL=71",
