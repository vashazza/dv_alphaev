    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare communication. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with repeated specifications, which slightly detract from overall cohesion. The logical connections between different requirements are mostly clear, but the repetition of certain specs indicates a lack of integration.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interactions, mental health crises, emergency protocols, and reproductive health. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, the repeated focus on certain areas like pregnancy and drug interactions suggests potential gaps in other critical areas, such as chronic disease management or pediatric care.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy in the specifications, with several specs being repeated verbatim. This indicates inefficiency and suggests that the policy set could be consolidated to avoid unnecessary duplication. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent observed here is excessive and detracts from the overall efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, which enhances their practicality. However, the repetition of overly specific rules, particularly regarding pregnancy and drug interactions, reduces the flexibility and broad applicability of the policy set."
