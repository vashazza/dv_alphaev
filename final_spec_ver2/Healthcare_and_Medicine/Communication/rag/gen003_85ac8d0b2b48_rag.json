    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare communication. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on safety warnings and the need for professional consultation. However, there is some repetition, particularly in the areas of pregnancy and drug interaction, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare communication, including drug interactions, mental health crises, emergency protocols, and reproductive health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there is a slight overemphasis on reproductive health without equivalent coverage in other areas like chronic disease management or pediatric care.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications related to pregnancy and drug interactions, which appear multiple times with similar wording. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to professional resources and emphasizing safety. They balance security with usability, though some rules are overly specific, such as those repeatedly addressing pregnancy, which could limit adaptability. The rules are mostly flexible and applicable to various contexts, but there is room for improvement in simplifying and broadening some requirements."
