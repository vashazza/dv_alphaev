Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical image generation, such as privacy, legality, and accuracy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 8, 9, 10, 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as the handling of sensitive patient data beyond PII, could be more comprehensively addressed..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical image generation, such as privacy, legality, and accuracy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 8, 9, 10, 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as the handling of sensitive patient data beyond PII, could be more comprehensively addressed.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 8, 9, 10, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, which is crucial for real-world implementation. However, some specifications could be more concise to enhance clarity and ease of implementation.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [2] (Score: 79) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, health...\n  - [3] (Score: 81) MUST NOT generate images depicting identifiable medical professionals, patients, or healthcare facil...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
