  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of privacy, legality, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations in healthcare image generation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and mental health scenarios. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of rules addressing the generation of images related to medical equipment or facilities.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of similar rules (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 9 are repeated). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various scenarios. However, some specifications could be overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability in broader contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including priva...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare and medical image generation, inc...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and e...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, from privacy and legality to misinformation and ethical con...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework aimed at ensuring safe...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical co...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for generating healthc...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, from anatomical accuracy to the prevention of harmful image...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy by cross-referencing medical terminology against established anatomica...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 86): MUST recognize prompts requesting visualization of self-harm methods, dangerous medical procedures, or life-threatening ...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation.
