Average group score: 75.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of risk, such as privacy, misinformation, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and mental health scenarios. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or cross-border compliance issues..

They complement each other by addressing different aspects of risk, such as privacy, misinformation, and ethical considerations. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and mental health scenarios. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or cross-border compliance issues.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 9, 12, and 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it appears more as unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) MUST maintain audit trails for medical image generation to enable clinical oversight and compliance ...\n  - [2] (Score: 66) MUST recognize when medical device imagery could enable misuse or counterfeiting and generate simpli...\n  - [3] (Score: 78) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
