  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as privacy, legality, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9, 12, and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and mental health crises. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine-related imagery.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 9, 12, and 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to rare diseases, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including priva...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including legal...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): SHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer g...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including legality, accuracy, misinformation, and ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): SHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer g...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for generating healthcare-relat...\n💬 Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, from anatomical accuracy to preventing the depiction...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy by cross-referencing medical terminology against established anatomica...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 86): MUST recognize prompts requesting visualization of self-harm methods, dangerous medical procedures, or life-threatening ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including privacy, legality, misin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including priva...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation.
