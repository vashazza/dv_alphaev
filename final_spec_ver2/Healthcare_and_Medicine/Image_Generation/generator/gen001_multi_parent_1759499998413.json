  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 79.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as legality, accuracy, and privacy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including legality, misinformation, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency scenarios and controlled substances. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or cross-border compliance issues.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13). While this provides robustness in critical areas, it also indicates inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating overlapping requirements.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexibility in implementation. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly reducing practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including legality, accuracy, misinformation, and privacy. ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): SHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer g...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including priva...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including legal...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): SHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer g...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including priva...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for generating healthcare-relat...\n💬 Coverage: The policy group covers a broad range of risks, from anatomical accuracy to preventing the depiction...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy by cross-referencing medical terminology against established anatomica...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 86): MUST recognize prompts requesting visualization of self-harm methods, dangerous medical procedures, or life-threatening ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including privacy, legality, misin...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation.
