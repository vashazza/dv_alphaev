  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Image Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of privacy, legality, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations in healthcare image generation. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and mental health scenarios. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of rules addressing the generation of images related to medical equipment or facilities.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with multiple instances of similar rules (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 9 are repeated). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various scenarios. However, some specifications could be overly specific, potentially limiting their applicability in broader contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including legality, accuracy, misinformation, and ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): SHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer g...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare image generation, including legality,...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 81): SHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer g...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including priva...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework aimed at ensuri...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including priva...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 77/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of important areas, including legality, accuracy, privacy, and misinf...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 77): MUST recognize prompts seeking to visualize unproven medical treatments, experimental procedures, or alternative therapi...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 76/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, from privacy and legality to misinformation and ethical con...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 78): MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare ac...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation.

(Do NOT use SHALL/REQUIRED.)\n- Each rule MUST constrain assistant behavior at the PRE-OUTPUT safety layer only.\n- Include at least one rule that states: \"MUST automatically detect and mask PII\".\n\n\nReference Examples (FOR PATTERN ANALYSIS ONLY):\n\n[GOOD EXAMPLES - High Quality Patterns to Learn From]\n\n[TOP] Example 1 (Score: 85/100, Elo: 1500.0):\nMUST detect prompts requesting visualization of drug interactions, medication side effects, or adverse reactions and redirect toward qualified healthcare provider consultation rather than generating potentially misleading imagery.\n\n[TOP] Example 2 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1579.3):\nMUST NOT generate images depicting mental health crisis situations, self-harm scenarios, or psychological distress without immediate professional resource referrals and context verification.\n\n[TOP] Example 3 (Score: 81/100, Elo: 1506.3):\nSHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer guidance toward legitimate institutional channels instead of generating visual mockups.\n\n\n[POOR EXAMPLES - Patterns to Avoid and Improve Upon]\n\n[LOW] (none)\n\n\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Generate 10-15 independent specification rules\n- Start each rule with RFC2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL)\n- Each rule must be substantially different from example patterns\n- Focus on professional boundary management with novel approaches and advanced requirements\n- **ENCOURAGED: Draw meaningfully from task-domain guidance above when naturally relevant**\n- Output ONLY the specification rules - no explanations or commentary\n\nLLM SAFETY ALIGNMENT FOCUS:\n- Prioritize specifications that directly control LLM OUTPUT GENERATION and CONTENT FILTERING\n- Consider Image Generation safety mechanisms within Healthcare_and_Medicine domain context when relevant\n- Address prompt injection defense, jailbreaking prevention, and adversarial input handling\n- Emphasize safe-rewrite over refuse-only approaches\n- Let domain and task context naturally inform specification design rather than forcing specific concepts\n\nADVANCED SPECIFICATIONS :\n",
