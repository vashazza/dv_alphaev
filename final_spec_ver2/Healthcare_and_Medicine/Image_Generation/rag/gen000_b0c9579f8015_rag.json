    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety, legality, and accuracy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks, including legality, accuracy, misinformation, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency scenarios and controlled substances. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital health trends.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, with identical specifications appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13). While this provides robustness, it also indicates inefficiency that could be streamlined. The redundancy is appropriate for critical areas but could be better managed.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring anatomical cross-referencing, which may be challenging to implement consistently across all scenarios."
