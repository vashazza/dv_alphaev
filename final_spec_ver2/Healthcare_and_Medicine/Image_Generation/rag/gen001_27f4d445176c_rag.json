    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as legality, accuracy, and privacy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including legality, misinformation, and privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as emergency scenarios and controlled substances. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or cross-border compliance issues.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 8, SPEC 7 and SPEC 13). While this provides robustness in critical areas, it also indicates inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating overlapping requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexibility in implementation. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly reducing practicality."
