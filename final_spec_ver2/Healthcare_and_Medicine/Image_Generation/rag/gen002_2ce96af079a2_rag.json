    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety and compliance, such as privacy, legality, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 9, 12, and 13), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and mental health crises. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine-related imagery.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules (e.g., SPEC 9, 12, and 13). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those related to rare diseases, which may limit their applicability in broader contexts."
