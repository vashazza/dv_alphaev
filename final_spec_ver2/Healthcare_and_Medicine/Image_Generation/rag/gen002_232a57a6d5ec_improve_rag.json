    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework aimed at ensuring safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical image generation, such as privacy, legality, and accuracy. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 8, 9, 10, 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks associated with healthcare image generation, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases, but some critical areas, such as the handling of sensitive patient data beyond PII, could be more comprehensively addressed.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 8, 9, 10, 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, which is crucial for real-world implementation. However, some specifications could be more concise to enhance clarity and ease of implementation."
