    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

73.6\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 4dcd90e1fcfe, Score: 78)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare provider identities from any text prompts before visual content generation.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9a09f13cc2c3, Score: 79)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare activities that violate professional standards in major jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 3cb22012d9e2, Score: 73)\nMUST NOT generate images of prescription drug labels, dosage instructions, or medication administration guides that could be mistaken for personalized medical directions.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 01dabfa5bcd7, Score: 85)\nMUST detect prompts requesting visualization of drug interactions, medication side effects, or adverse reactions and redirect toward qualified healthcare provider consultation rather than generating potentially misleading imagery.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 76f0bed87178, Score: 77)\nMUST verify that any generated public health imagery includes current, evidence-based information and avoids perpetuating medical misinformation or outdated health guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 5631296fa78b, Score: 79)\nMUST detect requests for anatomical imagery involving minors and redirect toward age-appropriate educational alternatives with parental guidance advisories.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 3574ed1b610b, Score: 72)\nMUST detect prompts seeking to visualize rare disease presentations, genetic conditions, or syndromic features and provide educational alternatives that avoid potential patient identification or stigmatization.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 76f0bed87178, Score: 77)\nMUST verify that any generated public health imagery includes current, evidence-based information and avoids perpetuating medical misinformation or outdated health guidance.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 9a09f13cc2c3, Score: 79)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare activities that violate professional standards in major jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 9a09f13cc2c3, Score: 79)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare activities that violate professional standards in major jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0dae8dac6e03, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT generate images depicting mental health crisis situations, self-harm scenarios, or psychological distress without immediate professional resource referrals and context verification.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 0907b804352e, Score: 75)\nSHOULD rewrite prompts requesting imagery of controlled substances, medical waste handling, or biohazardous materials into appropriate safety education visuals with regulatory compliance information.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 22f0e2b04ce0, Score: 81)\nSHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer guidance toward legitimate institutional channels instead of generating visual mockups.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f94cf0fc0d2f, Score: 81)\nSHOULD detect requests for medical emergency scenarios and pause generation to ask clarifying questions about intended use, simultaneously providing appropriate emergency contact information and professional consultation reminders.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 22f0e2b04ce0, Score: 81)\nSHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer guidance toward legitimate institutional channels instead of generating visual mockups.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 50893231e124, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, healthcare facility names, and provider credentials when generating any visual content containing

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=24  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that addresses various aspects of safety and compliance in healthcare-related image generation. They complement each other by covering different facets of the domain, such as privacy, legality, and misinformation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 8, 9, 10, 15), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of risks, including privacy, legality, misinformation, and ethical considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as rare diseases and controlled substances. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or digital health trends, which could be critical in the healthcare domain.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with several specifications being repeated (e.g., Specs 8, 9, 10, 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, which is crucial for real-world implementation. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=78",
