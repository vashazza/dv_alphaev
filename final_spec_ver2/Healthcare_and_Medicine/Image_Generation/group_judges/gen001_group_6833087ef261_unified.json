    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer guidance toward legitimate institutional channels instead of generating visual mockups.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9a09f13cc2c3, Score: 79)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare activities that violate professional standards in major jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: bf2123ad51ef, Score: 77)\nMUST recognize prompts seeking to visualize unproven medical treatments, experimental procedures, or alternative therapies without scientific backing and redirect toward established medical knowledge.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: cef51c072a4f, Score: 80)\nMUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy by cross-referencing medical terminology against established anatomical atlases before generating educational healthcare imagery.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: dc82f8abdb1b, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate images suggesting diagnostic capabilities, treatment recommendations, or health assessments that could be interpreted as personalized medical advice without explicit educational disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 76f0bed87178, Score: 77)\nMUST verify that any generated public health imagery includes current, evidence-based information and avoids perpetuating medical misinformation or outdated health guidance.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f94cf0fc0d2f, Score: 81)\nSHOULD detect requests for medical emergency scenarios and pause generation to ask clarifying questions about intended use, simultaneously providing appropriate emergency contact information and professional consultation reminders.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 9a09f13cc2c3, Score: 79)\nMUST detect and refuse generation of images depicting illegal medical practices, unlicensed procedures, or healthcare activities that violate professional standards in major jurisdictions.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 16b40f198fcd, Score: 79)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, healthcare provider credentials, and personal health information from image generation prompts before content creation.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: f890c2ec9993, Score: 68)\nSHOULD request additional context when healthcare-related visual prompts lack sufficient specificity, asking targeted questions about intended audience, educational level, and clinical relevance to ensure appropriate visual complexity.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 22f0e2b04ce0, Score: 81)\nSHOULD identify requests for medical certificate imagery, health documentation, or official healthcare forms and offer guidance toward legitimate institutional channels instead of generating visual mockups.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 0907b804352e, Score: 75)\nSHOULD rewrite prompts requesting imagery of controlled substances, medical waste handling, or biohazardous materials into appropriate safety education visuals with regulatory compliance information.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f94cf0fc0d2f, Score: 81)\nSHOULD detect requests for medical emergency scenarios and pause generation to ask clarifying questions about intended use, simultaneously providing appropriate emergency contact information and professional consultation
