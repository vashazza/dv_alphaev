    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare settings. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring data security. However, some specs could be better integrated to avoid overlap, particularly in areas like data protection and dosage recommendations.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including patient safety, data protection, and professional guidance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency situations and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies and telemedicine, which could be more explicitly covered.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could be streamlined to enhance practicality. For instance, the focus on specific medical scenarios could be broadened to cover more general use cases."
