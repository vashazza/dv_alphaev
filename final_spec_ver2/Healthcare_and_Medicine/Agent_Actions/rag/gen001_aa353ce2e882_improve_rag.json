    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare interactions. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing medical databases and redirecting users to healthcare providers. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare scenarios, including emergency situations, vulnerable populations, and medication interactions. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are some repeated specifications that could have been replaced with additional unique rules to cover more areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, with some specifications repeated multiple times (e.g., contextual safety scaling). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on redirecting users to professional medical advice. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
