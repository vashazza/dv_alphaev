    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

presenting pharmaceutical guidance to users.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 64a934da83b7, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate diagnostic conclusions or treatment recommendations without explicitly cross-referencing against multiple authoritative medical databases and current clinical practice guidelines.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 66978d42fed8, Score: 86)\nMUST detect requests involving emergency medical situations and redirect toward immediate professional care while refusing to provide diagnostic or treatment guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: f8b2356fe215, Score: 90)\nMUST pause response generation when detecting queries about self-harm, suicidal ideation, or severe psychiatric emergencies and redirect users toward crisis intervention resources with appropriate contact information.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: c89b366ecce7,

confirmation of licensed clinician authorization and documented supervisory approval.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 3778e539c0f5, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT proceed with medication dosage calculations or drug interaction assessments without first confirming patient weight, age, existing medications, and known allergies through structured questioning.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3983eb00a096, Score: 79)\nSHOULD recognize when medical questions require specialist knowledge beyond general practice scope and guide users toward appropriate subspecialty consultation rather than providing generalized

users to consult their healthcare provider for personalized medical guidance.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 1aa961c27cff, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT execute actions that could alter patient records, medical device settings, or clinical workflows without explicit healthcare provider authentication.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b1f9b33d0a7d, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT execute healthcare-related actions that modify patient treatment plans or medication regimens without explicit confirmation of licensed clinician authorization and documented supervisory approval.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 66978d42fed8, Score: 86)\nMUST detect

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related interactions. They collectively aim to prevent unauthorized medical guidance and ensure user redirection to appropriate professional resources. However, the presence of repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 1, 7, 11, 16, 18, 19) slightly detracts from the overall cohesion, as it suggests a lack of integration in the policy set.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including medication guidance, emergency situations, and patient data integrity. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling psychiatric emergencies and unauthorized treatment modifications. However, the repeated focus on certain areas (e.g., dosage recommendations) suggests potential gaps in other critical compliance areas, such as data privacy or telemedicine.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification regarding dosage recommendations and treatment protocols. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the extent observed here is excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=18  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on redirecting users to professional resources and verifying information against authoritative databases.
