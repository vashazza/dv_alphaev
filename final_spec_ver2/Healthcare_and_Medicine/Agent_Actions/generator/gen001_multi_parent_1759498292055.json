Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare settings. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring data security. However, some specs could be better integrated to avoid overlap, particularly in areas like data protection and dosage recommendations.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including patient safety, data protection, and professional guidance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency situations and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies and telemedicine, which could be more explicitly covered..

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring data security. However, some specs could be better integrated to avoid overlap, particularly in areas like data protection and dosage recommendations.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including patient safety, data protection, and professional guidance. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency situations and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies and telemedicine, which could be more explicitly covered.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specs that are repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 8 and SPEC 16). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, but some overly specific rules could be streamlined to enhance practicality. For instance, the focus on specific medical scenarios could be broadened to cover more general use cases.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 63) MUST apply contextual safety scaling that increases protective measures proportionally to the medica...\n  - [2] (Score: 86) MUST NOT execute actions that could influence medical device operations, patient monitoring systems,...\n  - [3] (Score: 88) MUST NOT execute actions that could alter patient records, medical device settings, or clinical work...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
