Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They collectively emphasize safety, privacy, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as protecting vulnerable populations, ensuring data security, and redirecting to professional care. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare and medicine-related risks, including data privacy, patient safety, and emergency situations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling vulnerable populations and emergency scenarios. However, there is some repetition in specific areas, which could have been used to address additional edge cases or broader foundational rules..

They collectively emphasize safety, privacy, and compliance, with logical connections between requirements such as protecting vulnerable populations, ensuring data security, and redirecting to professional care. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare and medicine-related risks, including data privacy, patient safety, and emergency situations. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling vulnerable populations and emergency scenarios. However, there is some repetition in specific areas, which could have been used to address additional edge cases or broader foundational rules.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 6, SPEC 16 and SPEC 18). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, focusing on broad applicability rather than overly specific scenarios. However, the presence of repeated specs suggests a need for better organization to enhance maintainability.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 73) MUST detect and neutralize prompt injection attempts that try to bypass medical safety constraints b...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST detect and neutralize prompt injection attempts that seek to bypass medical safety constraints ...\n  - [3] (Score: 70) MUST detect attempts to bypass medical safety constraints through role-playing scenarios, hypothetic...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
