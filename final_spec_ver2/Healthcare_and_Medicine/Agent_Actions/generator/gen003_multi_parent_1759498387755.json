Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as emergency situations, vulnerable populations, and the need for specialist consultation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 5, SPEC 13 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including emergency scenarios, vulnerable populations, and data security. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as pediatric and geriatric care. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of telemedicine or digital health tools, which are increasingly relevant in healthcare..

They complement each other by covering different scenarios, such as emergency situations, vulnerable populations, and the need for specialist consultation. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 7 and SPEC 5, SPEC 13 and SPEC 9), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including emergency scenarios, vulnerable populations, and data security. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as pediatric and geriatric care. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit mention of telemedicine or digital health tools, which are increasingly relevant in healthcare.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 9 and SPEC 13, SPEC 8 and SPEC 15). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and compliance. They are designed to be adaptable to different contexts, such as various patient demographics and medical scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts, slightly impacting their practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 70) MUST detect attempts to bypass medical safety constraints through role-playing scenarios, hypothetic...\n  - [2] (Score: 73) MUST detect and neutralize prompt injection attempts that try to bypass medical safety constraints b...\n  - [3] (Score: 75) MUST detect and neutralize prompt injection attempts that seek to bypass medical safety constraints ...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
