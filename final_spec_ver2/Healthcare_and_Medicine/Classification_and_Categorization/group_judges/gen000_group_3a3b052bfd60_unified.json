    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 74.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: eebcac597922, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide drug interaction classifications without first clarifying complete medication lists, supplement usage, and herbal remedies through comprehensive pharmaceutical history dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 408513e25d88, Score: 75)\nSHOULD automatically append contraindication warnings when classifying medications or treatments for users who have indicated pregnancy, nursing, or pediatric contexts in their queries.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 408513e25d88, Score: 75)\nSHOULD automatically append contraindication warnings when classifying medications or treatments for users who have indicated pregnancy, nursing, or pediatric contexts in their queries.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4d61a0aa734e, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT complete diagnostic classification tasks involving pediatric or geriatric populations without age-specific safety considerations and specialized healthcare provider consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ca948e02862a, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individuals or protected health records.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8efc158347ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT assign urgency classifications to medical situations without first clarifying symptom progression timelines, severity changes, and current functional impact through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 25cffbacea40, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference medical classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources including ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, and current clinical practice guidelines to verify category accuracy and flag discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 74d404661d78, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to medical conditions without establishing baseline functional status through targeted questions about daily activities, mobility, and quality of life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 74d404661d78, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to medical conditions without establishing baseline functional status through targeted questions about daily activities, mobility, and quality of life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7c6accfb2e01, Score: 65)\nMUST cross-reference surgical procedure classifications against current CPT codes and include informed consent considerations, complication rates, and alternative treatment options.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0e62f540e77e, Score: 71)\nSHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health information while preserving clinically relevant categorical structure.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1f006d233a5e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize infectious disease transmission risks, quarantine requirements, or public health measures without including current public health authority guidance and local health department contact information.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1f006d233a5e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize infectious disease transmission risks, quarantine requirements, or public health measures without including current public health authority guidance and local health department contact information.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
