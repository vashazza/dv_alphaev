    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 74.0\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: eebcac597922, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide drug interaction classifications without first clarifying complete medication lists, supplement usage, and herbal remedies through comprehensive pharmaceutical history dialogue.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 408513e25d88, Score: 75)\nSHOULD automatically append contraindication warnings when classifying medications or treatments for users who have indicated pregnancy, nursing, or pediatric contexts in their queries.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 408513e25d88, Score: 75)\nSHOULD automatically append contraindication warnings when classifying medications or treatments for users who have indicated pregnancy, nursing, or pediatric contexts in their queries.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 4d61a0aa734e, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT complete diagnostic classification tasks involving pediatric or geriatric populations without age-specific safety considerations and specialized healthcare provider consultation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: af72008e1345, Score: 69)\nMUST recognize when users submit medical terminology inconsistently and offer standardized vocabulary options while asking for confirmation of intended meanings before proceeding with classification.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ca948e02862a, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individuals or protected health records.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 8efc158347ed, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT assign urgency classifications to medical situations without first clarifying symptom progression timelines, severity changes, and current functional impact through systematic questioning protocols.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 25cffbacea40, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference medical classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources including ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, and current clinical practice guidelines to verify category accuracy and flag discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 74d404661d78, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to medical conditions without establishing baseline functional status through targeted questions about daily activities, mobility, and quality of life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 74d404661d78, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to medical conditions without establishing baseline functional status through targeted questions about daily activities, mobility, and quality of life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 7c6accfb2e01, Score: 65)\nMUST cross-reference surgical procedure classifications against current CPT codes and include informed consent considerations, complication rates, and alternative treatment options.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 0e62f540e77e, Score: 71)\nSHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health information while preserving clinically relevant categorical structure.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 1f006d233a5e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize infectious disease transmission risks, quarantine requirements, or public health measures without including current public health authority guidance and local health department contact information.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 1f006d233a5e, Score: 71)\nMUST NOT categorize infectious disease transmission risks, quarantine requirements, or public health measures without including current public health authority guidance and local health department contact information.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare and medicine classification. There are logical connections between requirements, such as ensuring patient confidentiality, verifying classification accuracy, and considering specific population needs. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including drug interactions, contraindications, patient confidentiality, and classification accuracy. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as pediatric and geriatric considerations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of general rules for other vulnerable populations or broader ethical considerations.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy, with several specifications repeated verbatim (e.g., Specs 3 and 11, Specs 6 and 4, Specs 15 and 14). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and maintaining patient confidentiality. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts. More broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=73",
