    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

77.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: d8389cffd6ee, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, or acute psychological distress without immediately prioritizing crisis intervention resources over categorization activities.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8da3d88514d2, Score: 75)\nMUST detect when classification requests involve pediatric medical information and automatically apply age-appropriate privacy protections with parental consent considerations and developmental stage qualifiers.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: f8ecf5c792b0, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT provide classification output for medical information that appears to originate from protected health records without explicit authorization verification.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: d426f8aa38cc, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT categorize medical symptoms or conditions without embedding uncertainty quantifiers and explicit disclaimers that classifications represent educational information rather than diagnostic determinations.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: a311acbcf7f4, Score: 78)\nMUST detect when medical classification outputs could enable medication abuse or self-harm behaviors and rewrite responses to emphasize harm reduction and professional support resources.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: b3965fb1bd5c, Score: 80)\nMUST recognize classification requests that combine multiple complex medical conditions and redirect toward multidisciplinary care team consultation rather than attempting simplified categorization.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: afaaafda832d, Score: 90)\nMUST identify requests for emergency triage categorization and immediately redirect toward emergency services contact while refusing to provide urgency classifications that could delay appropriate care.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: b7d3f2fb7d91, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT assign mental health categories to behavioral descriptions without including validated screening tool references and licensed mental health professional referral pathways.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: b3965fb1bd5c, Score: 80)\nMUST recognize classification requests that combine multiple complex medical conditions and redirect toward multidisciplinary care team consultation rather than attempting simplified categorization.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c29834fb307d, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize when classification requests involve sensitive reproductive health topics and modify approach through respectful clarifying questions while maintaining privacy-focused dialogue and appropriate specialist referrals.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: f8ecf5c792b0, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT provide classification output for medical information that appears to originate from protected health records without explicit authorization verification.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: d426f8aa38cc, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT categorize medical symptoms or conditions without embedding uncertainty quantifiers and explicit disclaimers that classifications represent educational information rather than diagnostic determinations.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 3bfc288131a5, Score: 83)\nMUST detect when users seek classification of medical devices, prosthetics, or assistive technologies and redirect toward certified medical device specialists or rehabilitation professionals rather than providing technical categorization.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d31d4d3a0817, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, medical record numbers, and provider credentials when present in categorization requests.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that prioritizes safety and compliance in healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of classification and categorization, such as mental health, pediatric information, and emergency situations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including mental health, pediatric care, emergency situations, and privacy concerns. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the domain's risk landscape. However, there could be more emphasis on general foundational rules to further enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with certain rules appearing more than once (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=17  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible, broadly applicable rules. However, some specs are quite specific, which could limit their applicability in certain scenarios. Overall, the policy set is implementable and maintainable in real-world healthcare settings.\n\nTOTAL=82",
