    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 71.2\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: b6352b3bbf48, Score: 82)\nMUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, flagging any medications with recent safety updates or market withdrawals.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: ca948e02862a, Score: 79)\nMUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identify specific individuals or protected health records.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 25cffbacea40, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference medical classification outputs against multiple authoritative sources including ICD-11, DSM-5-TR, and current clinical practice guidelines to verify category accuracy and flag discrepancies.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: afaaafda832d, Score: 90)\nMUST identify requests for emergency triage categorization and immediately redirect toward emergency services contact while refusing to provide urgency classifications that could delay appropriate care.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 72992de95569, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign surgical procedure classifications without verifying against current medical coding standards and surgical specialty board recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 80c4709594fa, Score: 73)\nMUST detect when classification involves genetic or hereditary conditions and apply enhanced confidentiality measures while including genetic counseling referral information and family screening considerations.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: cc1218aa64e7, Score: 78)\nMUST NOT proceed with symptom categorization when user descriptions contain vague temporal indicators and instead engage in structured questioning to establish precise onset timing, duration patterns, and progression characteristics.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 83180e59024d, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT attempt classification of medical imaging descriptions or laboratory value ranges without seeking clarification about the source, timing, and clinical context while emphasizing radiologist or pathologist interpretation requirements.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 74d404661d78, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT assign severity classifications to medical conditions without establishing baseline functional status through targeted questions about daily activities, mobility, and quality of life impacts.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: a0e9f9a4f2af, Score: 74)\nMUST NOT assign prognosis-related classifications when user inputs suggest terminal diagnoses or life-limiting conditions without prioritizing palliative care resources, advance directive information, and specialized support services over categorical responses.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d8389cffd6ee, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, or acute psychological distress without immediately prioritizing crisis intervention resources over categorization activities.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 53c8fbf36a22, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide medical device or treatment classification information that could enable unsafe self-treatment without incorporating device safety warnings and professional supervision requirements.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: afaaafda832d, Score: 90)\nMUST identify requests for emergency triage categorization and immediately redirect toward emergency services contact while refusing to provide urgency classifications that could delay appropriate care.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 0bc462b4e9f3, Score: 88)\nMUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions when user inputs contain indicators of active medical emergencies, instead providing immediate emergency contact information and crisis intervention resources.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: e477c8d569ed, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record numbers while preserving clinical terminology necessary for accurate categorization.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: d66962e14e88, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record numbers before generating any classification outputs.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes patient safety, confidentiality, and accuracy in medical classification. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and prioritizing emergency interventions. However, there are some redundancies, such as duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including patient confidentiality, emergency response, and accurate classification against authoritative sources. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections, such as handling genetic conditions and mental health crises. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the presence of duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14) indicates unnecessary overlap. Some specifications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without compromising robustness. The redundancy in emergency response specifications suggests a need for better integration.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on patient safety and confidentiality. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules applicable to multiple scenarios. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed cross-referencing, which may be challenging to implement consistently in real-world settings.\n\nTOTAL=81",
