Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare classification, such as reproductive health, surgical procedures, medication safety, and mental health, with a focus on privacy, accuracy, and professional consultation. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with dosage verification and surgical classification, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including sensitive topics, medication safety, and mental health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging healthcare technologies and digital health data privacy, which could enhance coverage..

They address various aspects of healthcare classification, such as reproductive health, surgical procedures, medication safety, and mental health, with a focus on privacy, accuracy, and professional consultation. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps, particularly with dosage verification and surgical classification, which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including sensitive topics, medication safety, and mental health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and controlled substances. However, there are minor gaps in addressing emerging healthcare technologies and digital health data privacy, which could enhance coverage.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with specifications related to dosage verification and surgical classification, which appear twice. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated for efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could improve by streamlining overlapping requirements.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing professional consultation and harm reduction. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed verification against medical coding standards, which may limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 62) SHOULD detect when classification boundaries between psychiatric and neurological conditions could l...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST NOT categorize reproductive health, fertility, or pregnancy-related medical information without...\n  - [3] (Score: 79) MUST NOT complete diagnostic classification tasks involving pediatric or geriatric populations witho...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Context-Aware Verification\nDescription: Implement dynamic verification protocols that adapt to domain-specific requirements and task characteristics.
