  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes patient safety, confidentiality, and compliance with medical standards. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and prioritizing emergency services. However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency triage, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as enhanced confidentiality for genetic conditions and crisis intervention for mental health issues. There are minor gaps in addressing non-emergency but urgent care scenarios.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with the repeated specification regarding the masking of PII (SPEC 2 and SPEC 6). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, this repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive overlap.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as emergency and non-emergency scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts, slightly impacting practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
