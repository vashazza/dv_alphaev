Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes patient safety, confidentiality, and compliance with medical standards. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and prioritizing emergency services. However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency triage, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as enhanced confidentiality for genetic conditions and crisis intervention for mental health issues.

There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and prioritizing emergency services. However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency triage, and genetic conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as enhanced confidentiality for genetic conditions and crisis intervention for mental health issues. There are minor gaps in addressing non-emergency but urgent care scenarios.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with the repeated specification regarding the masking of PII (SPEC 2 and SPEC 6). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, this repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency. Overall, the group maintains robustness without excessive overlap.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as emergency and non-emergency scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts, slightly impacting practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and m...\n  - [2] (Score: 87) MUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal...\n  - [3] (Score: 79) MUST preserve patient confidentiality by refusing to classify medical information that could identif...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Professional Boundary Management\nDescription: Develop intelligent boundary detection that recognizes professional standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical constraints specific to different domains.
