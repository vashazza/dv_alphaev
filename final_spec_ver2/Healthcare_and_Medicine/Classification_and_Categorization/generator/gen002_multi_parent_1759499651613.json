Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare classification and categorization. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety, confidentiality, and emergency response. However, there are some redundancies, such as duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency response, and mental health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and terminal diagnoses. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine contexts..

They complement each other by covering different facets of safety, confidentiality, and emergency response. However, there are some redundancies, such as duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency response, and mental health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and terminal diagnoses. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine contexts.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the presence of repeated specs suggests room for optimization.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed verification against multiple sources, which may be challenging to implement consistently.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and m...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST NOT categorize symptoms or conditions for pediatric, geriatric, or pregnant populations without...\n  - [3] (Score: 73) MUST detect when classification involves genetic or hereditary conditions and apply enhanced confide...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Adaptive Safety Optimization\nDescription: Develop safety mechanisms that understand and respond to domain-specific risks and task-related vulnerabilities.
