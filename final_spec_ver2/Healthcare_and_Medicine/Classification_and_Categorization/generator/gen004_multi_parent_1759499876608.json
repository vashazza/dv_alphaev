  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes patient safety, privacy, and appropriate intervention. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on privacy (Specs 1, 3, 4) and crisis intervention (Specs 2, 8, 11). However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, mental health, emergency intervention, and complex medical conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as pediatric and reproductive health considerations. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for non-emergency chronic conditions.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with Specs 5 and 7, and Specs 10 and 13, which are identical. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring immediate crisis intervention, which may not always be feasible in all settings..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritize...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, ment...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health informat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritize...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, mental health, emerg...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health informat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record number...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on privacy,...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including privacy, mental health, pediat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health informat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record number...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
