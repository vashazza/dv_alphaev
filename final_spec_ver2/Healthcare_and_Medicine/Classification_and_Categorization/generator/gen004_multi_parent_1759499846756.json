  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Classification & Categorization\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes patient safety, confidentiality, and compliance with medical standards. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and prioritizing emergency services. However, there is some duplication (e.g., PII masking), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency triage, and mental health crisis intervention. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and terminal diagnoses. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risk areas.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with the repeated specification for PII masking (SPEC 2 and SPEC 6), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the duplication here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by emphasizing the need for professional interpretation in complex cases. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritize...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, ment...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health informat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritize...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, mental health, emerg...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health informat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record number...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 73/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work together to form a cohesive policy framework, focusing on privacy,...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, including privacy, mental health, pediat...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 71): SHOULD identify potential HIPAA violations in classification requests and automatically redact protected health informat...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT provide mental health classifications when conversational patterns indicate active suicidal ideation, self-harm...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including drug safety, ...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 82): MUST cross-validate pharmaceutical classifications against current FDA drug safety communications and recall databases, ...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record number...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
