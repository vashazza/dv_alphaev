    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework that emphasizes patient safety, confidentiality, and accuracy in medical classification. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and prioritizing emergency interventions. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency triage, and mental health crisis intervention. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and terminal diagnoses. However, there are minor gaps in addressing non-emergency but still critical areas, such as chronic disease management.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14, SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate in critical safety areas, the repetition of similar specs without clear differentiation reduces the overall score.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as by emphasizing confidentiality and emergency response. However, some specs are overly specific, which may limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse healthcare contexts."
