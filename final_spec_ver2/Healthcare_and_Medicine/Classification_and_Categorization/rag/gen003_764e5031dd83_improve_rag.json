    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes patient safety, privacy, and appropriate intervention. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as the emphasis on privacy (Specs 1, 3, 4) and crisis intervention (Specs 2, 8, 11). However, there are some repeated specifications (Specs 5 and 7, Specs 10 and 13, Specs 8 and 14) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, mental health, emergency situations, and complex medical conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as pediatric privacy (Spec 3) and reproductive health (Spec 15). However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risk areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication in the specifications, particularly with Specs 5 and 7, Specs 10 and 13, and Specs 8 and 14. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these repetitions do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as mental health crises and emergency situations. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. Streamlining these could enhance practicality."
