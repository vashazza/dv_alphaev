    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare classification, such as privacy, accuracy, and safety, and there are logical connections between them. However, there are some redundancies and potential conflicts, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 7), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including reproductive health, surgical procedures, medication safety, and mental health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling sensitive topics and ensuring accurate classifications. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 7, SPEC 2 and SPEC 12), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios, slightly impacting practicality."
