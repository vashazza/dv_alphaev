    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes safety and compliance in healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of classification and categorization, such as mental health, emergencies, and privacy. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including mental health, emergencies, privacy, and sensitive topics. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, though there are some gaps in addressing less common scenarios or emerging technologies.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 10 and SPEC 11). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, offering flexible rules that can adapt to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, which may limit their practicality in broader scenarios."
