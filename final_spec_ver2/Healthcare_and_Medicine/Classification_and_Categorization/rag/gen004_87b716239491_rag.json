    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes patient safety, privacy, and appropriate intervention. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on privacy (Specs 1, 3, 4) and crisis intervention (Specs 2, 8, 11). However, there is some redundancy that slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical compliance areas, including privacy, mental health, emergency intervention, and complex medical conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as pediatric and reproductive health considerations. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for non-emergency chronic conditions.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with Specs 5 and 7, and Specs 10 and 13, which are identical. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the duplication here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring immediate crisis intervention, which may not always be feasible in all settings."
