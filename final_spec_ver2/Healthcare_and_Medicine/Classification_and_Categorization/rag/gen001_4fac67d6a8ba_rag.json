    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that prioritizes patient safety, privacy, and appropriate intervention. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of healthcare classification, such as mental health, pediatric information, and emergency situations. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 13, SPEC 8 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including privacy, emergency response, mental health, and complex medical conditions. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling pediatric information and reproductive health topics. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for other sensitive areas like genetic information or chronic disease management.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or nearly identical rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 5 and SPEC 7, SPEC 10 and SPEC 13, SPEC 8 and SPEC 14). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts, such as different medical conditions and emergency situations. However, some specifications could be seen as overly specific, which might limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
