    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of healthcare classification, such as confidentiality, emergency triage, and public health guidance. There are logical connections between requirements, such as cross-referencing authoritative sources and prioritizing patient safety. However, there is some duplication (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 6 are identical), which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare classification risks, including pharmaceutical safety, infectious disease, genetic conditions, and mental health crises. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as emergency triage and genetic counseling. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging health technologies or telemedicine, which are increasingly relevant.",
    "redundancy": "While there is some necessary redundancy for critical safety areas, such as confidentiality and emergency response, there are also instances of unnecessary duplication, notably SPEC 2 and SPEC 6 being identical. This could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. Overall, the redundancy is moderate but could be optimized further.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by emphasizing authoritative guidance and patient safety. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed cross-referencing of medical classifications, which may be challenging to implement consistently. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
