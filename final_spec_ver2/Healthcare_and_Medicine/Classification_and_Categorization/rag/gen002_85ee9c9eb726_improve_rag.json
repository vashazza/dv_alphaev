    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various aspects of healthcare classification and categorization. They complement each other by covering different facets of safety, confidentiality, and emergency response. However, there are some redundancies, such as duplicate specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare classification, including drug safety, patient confidentiality, emergency response, and mental health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as genetic conditions and terminal diagnoses. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for emerging technologies or telemedicine contexts.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, particularly with identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 13 and SPEC 14). While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness, but the presence of repeated specs suggests room for optimization.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring detailed verification against multiple sources, which may be challenging to implement consistently."
