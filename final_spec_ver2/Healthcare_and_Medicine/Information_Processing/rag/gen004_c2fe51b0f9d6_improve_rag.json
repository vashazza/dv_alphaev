    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as drug safety, source credibility, emergency advice, and mental health crisis detection. There are logical connections between the requirements, such as cross-referencing databases and verifying information accuracy. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 18 and SPEC 14) that slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of healthcare and medicine-related risks, including drug safety, mental health, reproductive health, and misinformation. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as rare genetic conditions and pediatric considerations. However, there are minor gaps in addressing certain critical compliance areas, such as data privacy and patient consent in non-minor contexts.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 18 and SPEC 14, SPEC 19 and SPEC 7). While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of similar requirements could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains robustness but could benefit from streamlining overlapping requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as emergency situations and age-appropriate content delivery. However, some rules are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. The group could improve by incorporating more flexible, broadly applicable rules."
