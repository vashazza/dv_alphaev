    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as mental health, misinformation, and emergency situations, with logical connections between them. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. It addresses a wide range of critical compliance areas, including mental health, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. The mix of general principles and specific scenarios is well-maintained, though there could be more emphasis on certain emerging healthcare topics.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are quite specific, which might limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality."
