    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as genetic testing, drug interactions, misinformation, and emergency advice. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation and the use of authoritative sources. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including genetic counseling, drug interactions, misinformation, and emergency advice. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as vulnerable populations and reproductive health. However, there are some repeated specs, which could have been replaced with additional unique rules to cover more areas.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs repeated verbatim (e.g., cross-referencing diagnostic criteria). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, in this case, it seems more like unnecessary duplication that could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling misinformation and providing emergency advice. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
