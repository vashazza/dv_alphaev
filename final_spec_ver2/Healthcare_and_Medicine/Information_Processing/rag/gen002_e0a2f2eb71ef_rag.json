    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare information processing. They complement each other by covering various aspects of medical information handling, such as genetic testing, drug interactions, and emergency situations. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 6, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14) that could have been consolidated to enhance cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including drug interactions, genetic testing, and mental health crisis intervention. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as rare diseases and veterinary medication misuse. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit coverage for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine.",
    "redundancy": "While some redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the presence of identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 6, SPEC 13 and SPEC 14) indicates unnecessary duplication. These could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness. The group maintains appropriate redundancy in critical areas like emergency response and mental health.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a strong emphasis on redirecting users to professional medical resources. They balance security with usability by providing disclaimers and emphasizing professional consultation. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on rare diseases, which could limit adaptability across different contexts."
