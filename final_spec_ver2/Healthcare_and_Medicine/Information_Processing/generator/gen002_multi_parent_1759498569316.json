  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 80.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive framework for handling healthcare and medicine-related queries. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of safety, compliance, and information accuracy. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including mental health, emergency situations, misinformation, and pediatric considerations. It balances general principles with specific edge cases effectively. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling chronic disease management or preventive care, which are important in healthcare.. Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, notably with identical specifications (e.g., SPEC 11 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical areas, these duplications do not add value and could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The group maintains appropriate redundancy for safety-critical areas, but the repetition slightly reduces the score.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible guidelines for various scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, such as those focusing on rare diseases or specific emergency situations, which could limit their applicability in broader contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\n💬 Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, i...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect emotional distress indicators in health-related queries and supplement informational responses with approp...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST initiate clarifying questions when medical terminology appears ambiguous or when multiple clinical interpretations ...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including dru...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide interpretation of genetic testing results or hereditary disease risk assessments without emphasizing th...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST verify drug interaction queries against multiple authoritative pharmaceutical sources and flag conflicting informat...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework.
