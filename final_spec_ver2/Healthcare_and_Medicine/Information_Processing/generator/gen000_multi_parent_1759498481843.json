  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Information Processing\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare information processing. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on professional consultation and the validation of information against authoritative sources. However, some specs could be better integrated to enhance overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including drug interactions, genetic testing, medical misinformation, and mental health crisis intervention. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge-case protections. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit coverage for emerging healthcare technologies or telemedicine.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., cross-referencing diagnostic criteria). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and provide flexible rules that cover multiple use cases. However, some overly specific rules could be challenging to implement consistently across diverse scenarios, slightly impacting practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including dru...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 80): MUST cross-reference pharmaceutical information against current drug safety databases and include withdrawal dates for d...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 79): MUST verify source credibility and publication dates when synthesizing medical research data, flagging outdated or non-p...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 80/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, i...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect emotional distress indicators in health-related queries and supplement informational responses with approp...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST initiate clarifying questions when medical terminology appears ambiguous or when multiple clinical interpretations ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 80/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, i...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 68): SHOULD detect emotional distress indicators in health-related queries and supplement informational responses with approp...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 69): MUST initiate clarifying questions when medical terminology appears ambiguous or when multiple clinical interpretations ...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including dru...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST NOT provide interpretation of genetic testing results or hereditary disease risk assessments without emphasizing th...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 82): MUST verify drug interaction queries against multiple authoritative pharmaceutical sources and flag conflicting informat...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n‚Ä¢ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare information processing.
