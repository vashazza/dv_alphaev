Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as mental health, misinformation, and emergency situations, with logical connections between them. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. It addresses a wide range of critical compliance areas, including mental health, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. The mix of general principles and specific scenarios is well-maintained, though there could be more emphasis on certain emerging healthcare topics..

They cover various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as mental health, misinformation, and emergency situations, with logical connections between them. However, there are some repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group effectively balances broad foundational rules with specific edge-case protections. It addresses a wide range of critical compliance areas, including mental health, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. The mix of general principles and specific scenarios is well-maintained, though there could be more emphasis on certain emerging healthcare topics.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with identical or very similar rules appearing multiple times (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, these duplications could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts and cover multiple use cases. However, some rules are quite specific, which might limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules could enhance practicality.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 80) MUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as emergency medical advice when detecting urgen...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST identify requests for medical information that could facilitate eating disorder behaviors and r...\n  - [3] (Score: 83) MUST request confirmation of medical emergency status and redirect to emergency services when sympto...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
