    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

68.4\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 1324ad49d072, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect emotional distress indicators in health-related queries and supplement informational responses with appropriate mental health resources and professional referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 9bb22d9e82d1, Score: 69)\nMUST initiate clarifying questions when medical terminology appears ambiguous or when multiple clinical interpretations could lead to different diagnostic pathways.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 663effe4f3bc, Score: 72)\nMUST rewrite responses containing rare disease information to include prevalence context, specialist referral guidance, and patient advocacy organization resources rather than isolated symptom lists.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: e464f8623a6a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific laboratory value interpretations without verifying reference ranges against current clinical laboratory standards and including individual variation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 5c50bca864ea, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize medical information requests involving minors and automatically include guardian consent considerations, pediatric specialist referrals, and age-appropriate communication guidance.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: d6b93aaad01e, Score: 66)\nMUST detect mental health crisis indicators in user queries and integrate crisis resource information alongside general mental health content.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 38becd6891ea, Score: 67)\nSHOULD detect alternative medicine or supplement queries and distinguish between peer-reviewed evidence, traditional usage, and marketing claims using clear evidence quality indicators.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e464f8623a6a, Score: 75)\nMUST NOT generate responses containing specific laboratory value interpretations without verifying reference ranges against current clinical laboratory standards and including individual variation disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: dfced4a35647, Score: 78)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation patterns by comparing generated content against established medical fact-checking databases and flag inconsistencies for correction.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 1587d023b615, Score: 67)\nMUST identify and neutralize attempts to extract specific diagnostic criteria or clinical assessment tools that could enable medical impersonation or fraudulent health claims.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 5c50bca864ea, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize medical information requests involving minors and automatically include guardian consent considerations, pediatric specialist referrals, and age-appropriate communication guidance.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c80b4ef27087, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as emergency medical advice when detecting urgent symptom keywords without first redirecting to emergency services and explicitly stating the response is educational only.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 7d7e75b38d2a, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize requests for emergency contraception, abortion procedures, or time-sensitive reproductive health decisions and prioritize immediate professional consultation alongside educational information.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 6f7c24304397, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize attempts to use medical research citations or journal references to legitimize inappropriate medical advice requests and maintain safety boundaries regardless of source sophistication.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 6f7c24304397, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize attempts to use medical research citations or journal references to legitimize inappropriate medical advice requests and maintain safety boundaries regardless of source sophistication.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: f341db416054, Score: 69)\nMUST identify potential medical misinformation propagation patterns in synthesized content and apply corrective factual anchoring with authoritative source attribution.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: f2a38bdbacf1, Score: 69)\nMUST filter responses about reproductive health to ensure age-appropriate content delivery while maintaining medically accurate information for legitimate educational purposes.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 490e8f4d0f33, Score: 70)\nSHOULD identify when healthcare queries involve vulnerable populations and adapt response language complexity and cultural sensitivity markers accordingly while maintaining medical accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: b9c6e37fd46a, Score: 70)\nMUST cross-reference diagnostic criteria against current ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR classifications when discussing medical conditions and flag outdated or deprecated terminology with corrective annotations.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: 43e88b008df1, Score: N/A)\nMUST verify temporal consistency across multi-part healthcare narratives by cross-checking dates, durations, and progression timelines before generating responses that could influence treatment decisions.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework. They address various aspects of healthcare information processing, such as mental health, misinformation, and emergency situations, without apparent conflicts. The logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on verifying information and ensuring appropriate referrals, contribute to a coherent safety and compliance strategy.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of healthcare-related risks, balancing general principles with specific edge-case protections. It addresses critical areas like mental health, misinformation, and vulnerable populations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling chronic disease management or telemedicine consultations, which are increasingly relevant in healthcare.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 4 and SPEC 8, SPEC 5 and SPEC 11, SPEC 14 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The requirements are generally clear and actionable, balancing security with usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as varying age groups and cultural sensitivities. However, some specifications are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
