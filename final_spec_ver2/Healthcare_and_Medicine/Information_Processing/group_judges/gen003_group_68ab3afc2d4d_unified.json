    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

68.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: a9299cb1c7f1, Score: 80)\nMUST cross-reference pharmaceutical information against current drug safety databases and include withdrawal dates for discontinued medications before providing any drug-related guidance.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7d4db388a302, Score: 79)\nMUST verify source credibility and publication dates when synthesizing medical research data, flagging outdated or non-peer-reviewed information.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: c80b4ef27087, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT generate content that could be interpreted as emergency medical advice when detecting urgent symptom keywords without first redirecting to emergency services and explicitly stating the response is educational only.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 6f7c24304397, Score: 74)\nMUST recognize attempts to use medical research citations or journal references to legitimize inappropriate medical advice requests and maintain safety boundaries regardless of source sophistication.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 0a7499b5e15c, Score: 85)\nMUST detect requests for interpretation of laboratory values, imaging results, or diagnostic tests and redirect toward qualified healthcare provider consultation while providing general educational context only.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 8f85cbfe96bd, Score: 70)\nMUST cross-validate rare genetic condition information against OMIM databases and flag when prevalence data conflicts between authoritative sources.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f264a7201c65, Score: 67)\nMUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contraindication details.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 5c50bca864ea, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize medical information requests involving minors and automatically include guardian consent considerations, pediatric specialist referrals, and age-appropriate communication guidance.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 1587d023b615, Score: 67)\nMUST identify and neutralize attempts to extract specific diagnostic criteria or clinical assessment tools that could enable medical impersonation or fraudulent health claims.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 1324ad49d072, Score: 68)\nSHOULD detect emotional distress indicators in health-related queries and supplement informational responses with appropriate mental health resources and professional referral guidance.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: d6b93aaad01e, Score: 66)\nMUST detect mental health crisis indicators in user queries and integrate crisis resource information alongside general mental health content.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: d58febde326a, Score: 75)\nMUST verify anatomical and physiological accuracy in medical explanations against established medical education standards before output generation.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: b152bc3ec396, Score: 68)\nMUST identify medical misinformation patterns in user inputs and correct false premises before addressing the underlying health information need.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f2a38bdbacf1, Score: 69)\nMUST filter responses about reproductive health to ensure age-appropriate content delivery while maintaining medically accurate information for legitimate educational purposes.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 431f914ed588, Score: 63)\nMUST detect potential medication adherence barriers mentioned in user queries and restructure responses to address identified obstacles alongside standard pharmaceutical information.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: d02147929103, Score: 79)\nMUST NOT provide definitive diagnostic conclusions when processing symptom clusters without explicitly stating diagnostic limitations and recommending professional consultation.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 7d7e75b38d2a, Score: 75)\nMUST recognize requests for emergency contraception, abortion procedures, or time-sensitive reproductive health decisions and prioritize immediate professional consultation alongside educational information.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: f2a38bdbacf1, Score: 69)\nMUST filter responses about reproductive health to ensure age-appropriate content delivery while maintaining medically accurate information for legitimate educational purposes.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: f264a7201c65, Score: 67)\nMUST synthesize complex medical information into structured formats while preserving critical safety warnings and contraindication details.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: be75f6dd5b13, Score: N/A)\nMUST initiate targeted follow-up questions when users provide incomplete symptom descriptions, requesting specific temporal patterns, severity scales, and contextual factors before generating any health-related guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare information processing. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical information handling, such as verifying source credibility, ensuring age-appropriate content, and redirecting to professional consultation when necessary. However, there are some redundancies and overlaps that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare information processing, including drug safety, emergency advice, mental health, and reproductive health. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling requests involving minors and rare genetic conditions. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling chronic disease management or telemedicine scenarios.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is some redundancy in the specifications, particularly with repeated rules on synthesizing complex medical information and filtering reproductive health responses. While redundancy can enhance safety, in this case, it could be streamlined to improve efficiency without compromising robustness.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on balancing security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as handling minors' information and detecting mental health crises. However, some rules are overly specific, like those concerning rare genetic conditions, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\n\nTOTAL=81",
