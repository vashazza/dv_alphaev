Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes security, privacy, and compliance in healthcare code generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on secure authentication and privacy-preserving practices. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interoperability, authentication, privacy, and clinical oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as dosage calculations and genetic data processing. However, there are minor gaps in areas like general data management and broader ethical considerations..

There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on secure authentication and privacy-preserving practices. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interoperability, authentication, privacy, and clinical oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as dosage calculations and genetic data processing. However, there are minor gaps in areas like general data management and broader ethical considerations.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications regarding medication dosage calculations and authentication bypass prevention. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit warnings for dosage calculations, which could limit flexibility in implementation.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 65) MUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safe...\n  - [2] (Score: 81) MUST NOT generate code that performs direct medical calculations or clinical scoring without transfo...\n  - [3] (Score: 83) MUST NOT generate code that directly calculates medication dosages without embedding explicit warnin...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
