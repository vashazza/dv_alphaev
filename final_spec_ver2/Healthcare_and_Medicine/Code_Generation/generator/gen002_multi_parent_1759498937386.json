  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 15-spec group. Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for generating healthcare-related code. They emphasize privacy, security, and user intent, which are critical in healthcare. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 9 and SPEC 12) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, API integration, telemedicine, and clinical decision support. However, there is a slight imbalance with some overly specific rules (e.g., clinical trial randomization) that could be generalized to improve coverage. The mix of general principles and specific edge cases is mostly appropriate, but there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies like AI in diagnostics.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy with identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 9 and SPEC 12), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on privacy and security, which is crucial in healthcare. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts (e.g., clinical trial randomization). More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes securi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim a...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmiss...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect ambiguous medical terminology in user queries and request clarification between clinical versu...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including decision s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide code for automated treatment recommendations without clarifying the role of healthcare provider oversig...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documente...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documente...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on security, privacy, and compliance in healthcare ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST NOT generate authentication bypass code for electronic health records and instead provide secure access pattern exa...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for generating healthcare-related code.
