  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 16-spec group. Average group score: 82.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on privacy, security, and safety in healthcare code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on privacy protection and secure access patterns. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, security, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as telemedicine security and medication dosage calculations. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling other sensitive data types beyond those mentioned.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1 and 7, Specs 8 and 15, Specs 2 and 12), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical areas like security is beneficial, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as distinguishing between educational and production code. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmiss...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes securi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim a...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmiss...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes securi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim a...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including decision s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide code for automated treatment recommendations without clarifying the role of healthcare provider oversig...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documente...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documente...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on privacy, security, and safety in healthcare code generation.
