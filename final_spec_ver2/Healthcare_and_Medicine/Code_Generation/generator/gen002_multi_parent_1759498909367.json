Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes security, privacy, and compliance in healthcare code generation. There are logical connections between different requirements, such as the emphasis on secure authentication and privacy-preserving practices. However, there are some redundancies that slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interoperability, authentication, privacy, and clinical oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as dosage calculations and genetic data processing. However, there are minor gaps in areas like general data management and broader ethical considerations.. Redundancy: There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications regarding medication dosage calculations and authentication bypass prevention. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specifications are overly specific, such as those requiring explicit warnings for dosage calculations, which could limit flexibility in implementation..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes securi...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 65): MUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim a...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 82/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on priv...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 81): MUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmiss...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 3 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: N/A): MUST automatically detect ambiguous medical terminology in user queries and request clarification between clinical versu...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 79/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including decision s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 83): MUST NOT provide code for automated treatment recommendations without clarifying the role of healthcare provider oversig...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documente...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses various a...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, s...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 66): MUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanc...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 80): MUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documente...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 3 (Score: 75/100)\n💬 Cohesion: The specs generally work well together, focusing on security, privacy, and compliance in healthcare ...\n💬 Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interopera...\n\n  • Spec 1 (Score: 70): SHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data forma...\n  • Spec 2 (Score: 84): MUST NOT generate authentication bypass code for electronic health records and instead provide secure access pattern exa...\n\n\n\nCURRENT GROUP FEEDBACK:\n• Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent framework that emphasizes security, privacy, and compliance in healthcare code generation.
