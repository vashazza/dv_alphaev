    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework focused on privacy, security, and safety in healthcare code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on privacy protection and secure access patterns. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including privacy, security, and safety. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as telemedicine security and medication dosage calculations. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling other sensitive data types beyond those mentioned.",
    "redundancy": "There is some redundancy, particularly with repeated specifications (e.g., Specs 1 and 7, Specs 8 and 15, Specs 2 and 12), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While redundancy in critical areas like security is beneficial, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as distinguishing between educational and production code. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
