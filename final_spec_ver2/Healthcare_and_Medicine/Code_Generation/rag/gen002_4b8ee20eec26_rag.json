    "cohesion": "The specs generally work well together, forming a coherent framework for generating healthcare-related code. They emphasize privacy, security, and user intent, which are critical in healthcare. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 9 and SPEC 12) that could be consolidated for better cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas, including privacy, API integration, telemedicine, and clinical decision support. However, there is a slight imbalance with some overly specific rules (e.g., clinical trial randomization) that could be generalized to improve coverage. The mix of general principles and specific edge cases is mostly appropriate, but there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies like AI in diagnostics.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy with identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 9 and SPEC 12), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.",
    "practicality": "The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on privacy and security, which is crucial in healthcare. However, some rules are overly specific and may not be easily adaptable to different contexts (e.g., clinical trial randomization). More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality."
