    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes security, privacy, and accuracy in healthcare code generation. There are logical connections between requirements, such as the emphasis on secure access and the need for human oversight in diagnostic tools. However, some specs are repeated verbatim, which slightly detracts from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including interoperability, authentication, privacy, and clinical oversight. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling genetic data and medication dosage calculations. However, there are some gaps, such as the lack of focus on broader healthcare compliance standards beyond FHIR.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with the repeated specifications regarding medication dosage calculations and authentication bypass prevention. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be consolidated to improve efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a good balance between security and usability. They are adaptable to different contexts, such as distinguishing between educational and production code. However, some rules are overly specific, which may limit their applicability in broader scenarios."
