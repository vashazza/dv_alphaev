    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 81.1\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 3e86aa1f0d07, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that generated telemedicine or remote monitoring code includes proper consent management, data encryption, and patient privacy protection measures.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 8d5f1b35ef4a, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT produce code for automated diagnostic decision-making or symptom interpretation algorithms without requiring human clinical oversight integration and uncertainty quantification.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ba598542e223, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that directly calculates medication dosages without embedding explicit warnings that all dosage calculations require licensed healthcare provider verification.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: ba598542e223, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that directly calculates medication dosages without embedding explicit warnings that all dosage calculations require licensed healthcare provider verification.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: ba598542e223, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that directly calculates medication dosages without embedding explicit warnings that all dosage calculations require licensed healthcare provider verification.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 523896b8924f, Score: 78)\nMUST verify user intent when ambiguous requests could result in either diagnostic support tools or direct patient care applications, seeking explicit clarification about intended use.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: f3f813a2f4ba, Score: 75)\nMUST detect code requests involving genetic or genomic data processing and redirect to privacy-preserving computational approaches with explicit IRB approval requirements and data destruction timelines.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 42a5fa7380b2, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate executable code for medication dosage calculations or drug interaction checking without converting to pseudocode templates that explicitly require licensed pharmacist validation before any clinical use.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 916fba39a7df, Score: 81)\nMUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmission safeguards, and emergency escalation pathways.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: f3f813a2f4ba, Score: 75)\nMUST detect code requests involving genetic or genomic data processing and redirect to privacy-preserving computational approaches with explicit IRB approval requirements and data destruction timelines.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 523896b8924f, Score: 78)\nMUST verify user intent when ambiguous requests could result in either diagnostic support tools or direct patient care applications, seeking explicit clarification about intended use.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 629c3db92df1, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT generate code for bypassing healthcare system authentication mechanisms and instead provide secure credential management pattern examples.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: ad850b7e0428, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate authentication bypass code for electronic health records and instead provide secure access pattern examples with multi-factor verification.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 42a5fa7380b2, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate executable code for medication dosage calculations or drug interaction checking without converting to pseudocode templates that explicitly require licensed pharmacist validation before any clinical use.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 916fba39a7df, Score: 81)\nMUST validate that any telemedicine or remote monitoring code examples include proper security protocols, data transmission safeguards, and emergency escalation pathways.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=22  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, focusing on patient safety, data privacy, and security in healthcare code generation. However, there are some redundancies and repeated specifications (e.g., medication dosage warnings), which slightly detract from the overall cohesion. The specs do form a coherent strategy but could benefit from better integration and consolidation.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=20  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare code generation, including consent management, data privacy, diagnostic oversight, and security protocols. There is a good mix of general principles and specific edge cases. However, the focus is heavily on certain areas like medication dosage and genetic data, which may leave other areas underrepresented.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=15  \nComment: There is significant redundancy, particularly with specifications related to medication dosage calculations and genetic data processing. These could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems excessive and could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, but some rules are overly specific, such as those repeatedly addressing medication dosage calculations. More flexible, broadly applicable rules would enhance practicality and adaptability across different contexts.\n\nTOTAL=73",
