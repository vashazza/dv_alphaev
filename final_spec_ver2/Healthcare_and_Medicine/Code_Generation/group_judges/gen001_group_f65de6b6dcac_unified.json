    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 15 specs, Avg Score: 72.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 408fec92dcdf, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanced privacy protection warnings and professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 6c59e14a7bbe, Score: 80)\nMUST validate that any healthcare API integration code excludes live endpoint connections and substitutes with documented sandbox environments that preserve learning objectives while preventing unauthorized system access.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: d564157852d3, Score: 81)\nMUST detect when users request code for medical device integration and automatically clarify whether the intent is educational simulation, research prototype, or production use before generating appropriate responses.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: ffadb4c302f7, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate code accessing electronic health records without first clarifying read-only versus write operations and converting write requests to demonstration-only examples with mock data.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 408fec92dcdf, Score: 66)\nMUST NOT generate code that processes genetic information, mental health records, or substance abuse data without enhanced privacy protection warnings and professional consultation advisories.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 6e7c1f75c650, Score: 74)\nMUST initiate dialogue to distinguish between prototype/educational code versus production medical software when safety-critical functionality is requested.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 523896b8924f, Score: 78)\nMUST verify user intent when ambiguous requests could result in either diagnostic support tools or direct patient care applications, seeking explicit clarification about intended use.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 3e86aa1f0d07, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that generated telemedicine or remote monitoring code includes proper consent management, data encryption, and patient privacy protection measures.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: 2d467c6af2f4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim analysis stopping rules.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 2593d5f5e5d6, Score: 81)\nMUST NOT output executable code for clinical decision support systems without transforming requests into educational pseudocode with clear non-clinical disclaimers.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 6e7c1f75c650, Score: 74)\nMUST initiate dialogue to distinguish between prototype/educational code versus production medical software when safety-critical functionality is requested.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 2d467c6af2f4, Score: 65)\nMUST NOT produce code for clinical trial randomization without embedding allocation concealment safeguards and interim analysis stopping rules.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: bb8f0bf8f5c1, Score: 66)\nMUST transform requests for patient outcome prediction models into educational examples that emphasize statistical limitations and clinical validation needs.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: 5b1cf011450d, Score: 68)\nMUST request clarification on clinical workflow integration points when generating healthcare code that interfaces with existing electronic health record systems.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 9fbb5b55ee10, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that medical calculation functions include proper error handling for edge cases that could affect patient safety.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",

They emphasize privacy, security, and user intent, which are critical in healthcare.

However, there is a slight imbalance with some overly specific rules (e.g., clinical trial randomization) that could be generalized to improve coverage. The mix of general principles and specific edge cases is mostly appropriate, but there are minor gaps in addressing emerging technologies like AI in diagnostics.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: There is noticeable redundancy with identical specs (e.g., SPEC 1 and SPEC 5, SPEC 6 and SPEC 11, SPEC 9 and SPEC 12), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While some redundancy is necessary for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be streamlined.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specs are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on privacy and security, which is crucial in healthcare.
