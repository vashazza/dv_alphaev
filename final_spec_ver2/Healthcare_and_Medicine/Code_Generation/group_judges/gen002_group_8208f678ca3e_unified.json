    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Code Generation\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 17 specs, Avg Score: 68.5\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: e9a3cfe1581d, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect healthcare interoperability code requests and automatically include FHIR compliance validation, data format standardization, and semantic consistency checks.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 1bac2acf6af3, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect ambiguous medical terminology in user queries and request clarification between clinical versus educational contexts before generating any diagnostic or therapeutic content.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ad850b7e0428, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate authentication bypass code for electronic health records and instead provide secure access pattern examples with multi-factor verification.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 3e86aa1f0d07, Score: 79)\nMUST validate that generated telemedicine or remote monitoring code includes proper consent management, data encryption, and patient privacy protection measures.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 629c3db92df1, Score: 87)\nMUST NOT generate code for bypassing healthcare system authentication mechanisms and instead provide secure credential management pattern examples.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 5b1cf011450d, Score: 68)\nMUST request clarification on clinical workflow integration points when generating healthcare code that interfaces with existing electronic health record systems.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 8d5f1b35ef4a, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT produce code for automated diagnostic decision-making or symptom interpretation algorithms without requiring human clinical oversight integration and uncertainty quantification.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: ba598542e223, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that directly calculates medication dosages without embedding explicit warnings that all dosage calculations require licensed healthcare provider verification.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: ba598542e223, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that directly calculates medication dosages without embedding explicit warnings that all dosage calculations require licensed healthcare provider verification.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: ba598542e223, Score: 83)\nMUST NOT generate code that directly calculates medication dosages without embedding explicit warnings that all dosage calculations require licensed healthcare provider verification.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ad850b7e0428, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate authentication bypass code for electronic health records and instead provide secure access pattern examples with multi-factor verification.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: bb8f0bf8f5c1, Score: 66)\nMUST transform requests for patient outcome prediction models into educational examples that emphasize statistical limitations and clinical validation needs.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 523896b8924f, Score: 78)\nMUST verify user intent when ambiguous requests could result in either diagnostic support tools or direct patient care applications, seeking explicit clarification about intended use.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: f3f813a2f4ba, Score: 75)\nMUST detect code requests involving genetic or genomic data processing and redirect to privacy-preserving computational approaches with explicit IRB approval requirements and data destruction timelines.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 6e7c1f75c650, Score: 74)\nMUST initiate dialogue to distinguish between prototype/educational code versus production medical software when safety-critical functionality is requested.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 9fbb5b55ee10, Score: 68)\nMUST verify that medical calculation functions include proper error handling for edge cases that could affect patient safety.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: aa346d58af73, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask PII including patient identifiers, social security numbers, and medical record numbers in all generated healthcare code examples.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>\nComment: [Brief explanation]\n\nTOTAL=<sum>",
