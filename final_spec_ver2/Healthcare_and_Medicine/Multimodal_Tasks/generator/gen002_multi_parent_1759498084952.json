Average group score: 78.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for handling multimodal inputs in healthcare. They address various aspects of safety, privacy, and accuracy, with logical connections between requirements such as handling emergencies, privacy protection, and verifying medical information. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including privacy, emergency handling, misinformation, and device verification. There is a good balance between general principles and specific edge cases, such as handling minors' data and psychiatric crises.

They address various aspects of safety, privacy, and accuracy, with logical connections between requirements such as handling emergencies, privacy protection, and verifying medical information. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including privacy, emergency handling, misinformation, and device verification. There is a good balance between general principles and specific edge cases, such as handling minors' data and psychiatric crises. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for certain medical specialties or scenarios.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is significant redundancy, particularly with specs related to masking personally identifiable information and handling emergencies. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of nearly identical specs suggests inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating similar requirements.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and privacy. They are designed to be implementable in real-world scenarios, balancing security with usability. However, the repetition of overly specific rules, such as those for masking information, could complicate maintenance and implementation.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 71) MUST pause when multimodal mental health content contains ambiguous emotional indicators, using empa...\n  - [2] (Score: 75) MUST verify user intent when multimodal inputs could represent either emergency situations or educat...\n  - [3] (Score: 86) MUST pause response generation when audio inputs contain medical terminology suggesting active psych...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Specialized Knowledge Integration\nDescription: Enhance responses by intelligently incorporating domain-specific concepts, terminology, and best practices while adapting to task requirements.
