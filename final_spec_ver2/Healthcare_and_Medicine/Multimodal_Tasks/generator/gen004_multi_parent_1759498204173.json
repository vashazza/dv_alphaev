Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related multimodal tasks. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical data handling, emergency situations, and diagnostic limitations. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency response, diagnostic accuracy, and data privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deepfakes and vulnerable populations. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks..

They complement each other by addressing various aspects of medical data handling, emergency situations, and diagnostic limitations. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n‚Ä¢ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency response, diagnostic accuracy, and data privacy. It balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deepfakes and vulnerable populations. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential risks.\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy: There is some unnecessary duplication, such as repeated specifications (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 9 and SPEC 14, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated to improve efficiency. While appropriate redundancy exists for critical safety areas, the repetition of certain specs indicates room for streamlining.\n‚Ä¢ Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on directing users to professional resources and ensuring safety. They balance security with usability and are adaptable to different contexts. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit their applicability in broader scenarios.\nSIMILAR EXISTING SPECS:\n  - [1] (Score: 81) MUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medi...\n  - [2] (Score: 74) MUST NOT reproduce specific lab values, vital signs, or diagnostic measurements from multimodal medi...\n  - [3] (Score: 66) SHOULD recognize cultural or linguistic barriers in multimodal medical communications and adapt resp...\nConstitution: Build secure, reliable, and user-friendly AI systems.\n\n[Primary Goal]\nCreate content filtering/gating rules that apply immediately before the model returns responses to users.\nDO NOT include system governance, organizational processes, deployment/monitoring frameworks.\n\n[Focus]\nSelected sub-Focus: Interactive Clarification Enhancement\nDescription: Create sophisticated dialogue management that seeks clarification when domain complexity or task ambiguity arises.
