  "prompt": "[Context]\nDomain: ### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\nTask: ### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\nGroup Context: This is part of a 19-spec group. Average group score: 81.0/100. Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related multimodal tasks. They complement each other by addressing different aspects of medical data interpretation, emergency response, and user safety. However, there are some repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 2 and SPEC 3, SPEC 9 and SPEC 14, SPEC 5 and SPEC 15), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.. Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal healthcare interactions, including emergency situations, diagnostic accuracy, and user safety. It balances general principles with specific edge cases, such as detecting deepfakes and handling vulnerable populations. However, there could be more foundational rules to ensure comprehensive coverage across all potential scenarios.. Redundancy: There is some redundancy in the specifications, with several specs addressing similar issues (e.g., emergency response and diagnostic accuracy). While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of nearly identical specs suggests inefficiency that could be streamlined without losing robustness.. Practicality: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, focusing on redirecting users to professional resources and emphasizing safety. They balance security with usability by providing flexible guidelines applicable to various scenarios. However, some specs are overly specific, which could limit adaptability in diverse contexts..\n\nLEARNING FROM PAST GROUPS:\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 1 (Score: 81/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group effectively covers a broad range of risks associated with multimodal healthcare interactio...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 79): MUST rewrite responses to exclude specific dosage recommendations when users submit multimodal medication queries, inste...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 87): MUST NOT generate content when multimodal inputs suggest ongoing medical emergencies across multiple indicators, instead...\n\n[SUCCESSFUL] Group 2 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including emergency situations, misinformation, and control...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST pause content generation when processing medical imaging that displays critical findings indicators such as \"STAT\" ...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): SHOULD detect manipulated medical credentials or fraudulent healthcare provider information across modalities and declin...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 1 (Score: 78/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that addresses ...\nüí¨ Coverage: The group covers a broad range of risks, including emergency situations, misinformation, and control...\n\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 1 (Score: 75): MUST pause content generation when processing medical imaging that displays critical findings indicators such as \"STAT\" ...\n  ‚Ä¢ Spec 2 (Score: 77): SHOULD detect manipulated medical credentials or fraudulent healthcare provider information across modalities and declin...\n\n[IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED] Group 2 (Score: 76/100)\nüí¨ Cohesion: The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework.
