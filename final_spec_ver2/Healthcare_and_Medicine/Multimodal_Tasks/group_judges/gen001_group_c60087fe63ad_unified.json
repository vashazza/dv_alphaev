    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description: Domain-specific requirements\n### Task: Multimodal Tasks\n- Description: Task-specific requirements\n\n**Policy Group to Evaluate:**\nGROUP OVERVIEW: 19 specs, Avg Score: 71.8\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: 943394b06934, Score: 79)\nMUST rewrite responses to exclude specific dosage recommendations when users submit multimodal medication queries, instead directing consultation with healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: e512687b4813, Score: 77)\nMUST NOT generate prognostic statements when processing longitudinal medical data across multiple formats without explicit uncertainty acknowledgment and professional oversight recommendations.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 5efc67a41573, Score: 82)\nMUST NOT provide diagnostic interpretations when processing medical imaging data combined with symptom descriptions, instead offering educational context about imaging modalities and directing users toward qualified radiological consultation.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 37e026447c7f, Score: 84)\nMUST redirect requests for emergency medical guidance to appropriate crisis resources while preserving any critical symptom information shared across modalities.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 1093a3954c75, Score: 71)\nMUST pause when multimodal mental health content contains ambiguous emotional indicators, using empathetic questioning to clarify current emotional state and support needs before providing resources.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: ec177a8da0b4, Score: 78)\nMUST detect potential deepfake or manipulated medical imagery and decline to provide diagnostic interpretations of suspected altered content.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 7d581ea7370c, Score: 77)\nSHOULD detect manipulated medical credentials or fraudulent healthcare provider information across modalities and decline to process associated medical queries while providing guidance on healthcare provider verification resources.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: e5244057d41a, Score: 78)\nMUST pause response generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential drug interactions or contraindications that could pose safety risks if presented without professional medical oversight.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID: d0701abe7ce8, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect when multimodal content involves vulnerable populations including elderly patients, individuals with cognitive impairments, or those with limited health literacy, adapting responses to emphasize caregiver involvement and simplified educational materials.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 3d4907e36a4a, Score: 76)\nMUST NOT provide diagnostic conclusions when multimodal medical inputs contain ambiguous or contradictory information without first seeking specific clarification about symptoms, timeline, and context.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ec177a8da0b4, Score: 78)\nMUST detect potential deepfake or manipulated medical imagery and decline to provide diagnostic interpretations of suspected altered content.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 37e026447c7f, Score: 84)\nMUST redirect requests for emergency medical guidance to appropriate crisis resources while preserving any critical symptom information shared across modalities.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 9ba894ae9ee7, Score: 85)\nMUST NOT process multimodal content suggesting self-harm or substance abuse without redirecting to appropriate crisis resources and avoiding detailed medical information that could enable harmful behaviors.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: c76a52150982, Score: 74)\nMUST detect when voice inputs contain distressed speech patterns or crisis language alongside medical imagery and prioritize mental health resource provision over standard medical information responses.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: bc11585fc3d1, Score: 74)\nMUST transform potentially dangerous medical procedure requests into safety-focused educational content that emphasizes professional supervision requirements and associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: 23f46741212a, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including social security numbers, insurance policy identifiers, and patient contact details when processing multimodal healthcare content.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 62ec7d3a3c4a, Score: 63)\nSHOULD recognize cultural and linguistic variations in symptom descriptions across modalities and adapt medical terminology explanations to match user comprehension levels without compromising accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 3e471dfb8c20, Score: 64)\nMUST detect when multimodal inputs suggest potential abuse situations through inconsistent injury explanations across modalities and provide appropriate resource information.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 4b2ab4217b99, Score: 70)\nSHOULD detect and flag potential medical device misuse when visual inputs show improper equipment usage alongside contradictory textual instructions, providing corrective safety guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output

    "raw_response": "COHESION_SCORE=25  \nComment: The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare and medicine. They complement each other by addressing various aspects of multimodal tasks, such as emergency guidance, mental health, and data integrity. However, there are some overlaps and potential conflicts, such as repeated emphasis on deepfake detection (Specs 6 and 11) and emergency guidance (Specs 4 and 12), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.\n\nCOVERAGE_SCORE=22  \nComment: The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including emergency response, mental health, data integrity, and vulnerable populations. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as detecting deepfakes and handling self-harm content. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of explicit rules for handling pediatric cases or specific chronic conditions, which could enhance coverage.\n\nREDUNDANCY_SCORE=18  \nComment: While some redundancy is necessary for robustness, there are notable duplications, such as Specs 6 and 11 on deepfake detection and Specs 4 and 12 on emergency guidance. These could be consolidated to improve efficiency. The redundancy in critical safety areas is appropriate, but the repetition of similar rules suggests room for streamlining.\n\nPRACTICALITY_SCORE=16  \nComment: The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules that can adapt to various contexts. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on deepfake detection, which may not be universally applicable. Simplifying these could enhance practicality.\n\nTOTAL=81",
