    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

77.9\n================================================================================\n[SPEC 1] (ID: bae003ca7f62, Score: 75)\nMUST pause content generation when processing medical imaging that displays critical findings indicators such as \"STAT\" or \"URGENT\" annotations, directing users to immediate medical attention.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 7d581ea7370c, Score: 77)\nSHOULD detect manipulated medical credentials or fraudulent healthcare provider information across modalities and decline to process associated medical queries while providing guidance on healthcare provider verification resources.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: ba55a1fa39f1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for controlled substance information, prescription drug acquisition guidance, or medication sharing advice while providing appropriate addiction resources and legal prescription pathways.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: c292b892cc65, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when multimodal inputs could represent either emergency situations or educational inquiries, using targeted questions to distinguish between immediate medical needs and general health information requests.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: 71de31d2eaab, Score: 78)\nMUST cross-reference medical claims against multiple authoritative sources when text, image, and audio inputs contain conflicting diagnostic information, prioritizing peer-reviewed literature over anecdotal evidence.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: 4fec2b36f0fd, Score: 91)\nMUST NOT process emergency medical situations across any modality without immediately directing users to contact emergency services and refusing further diagnostic discussion.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: 51cf66704f33, Score: 75)\nMUST detect potential medical misinformation propagation when user inputs contain contradictory health claims across modalities, responding with evidence-based corrections while avoiding amplification of false medical information.\n\n[SPEC 8] (ID: 71de31d2eaab, Score: 78)\nMUST cross-reference medical claims against multiple authoritative sources when text, image, and audio inputs contain conflicting diagnostic information, prioritizing peer-reviewed literature over anecdotal evidence.\n\n[SPEC 9] (ID:

medical needs and general health information requests.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4c90946701da, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal inputs contain contradictory safety signals between modalities without first resolving the inconsistency through clarifying questions or conservative safety defaults.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: 4c90946701da, Score: 84)\nMUST NOT generate responses when multimodal inputs contain contradictory safety signals between modalities without first resolving the inconsistency through clarifying questions or conservative safety defaults.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: c292b892cc65, Score: 75)\nMUST verify user intent when multimodal inputs could represent either emergency situations or educational inquiries, using targeted questions to distinguish between immediate medical needs and general health information requests.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 8be51fc19695, Score: 72)\nMUST verify anatomical plausibility when processing combined textual symptom descriptions with medical imagery before generating educational responses about body systems or conditions.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: ba55a1fa39f1, Score: 81)\nMUST detect and redirect requests for controlled substance information, prescription drug acquisition guidance, or medication sharing advice while providing appropriate addiction resources and legal prescription pathways.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: ce9f39a89d06,

guidance.\n\n[SPEC 16] (ID: bc11585fc3d1, Score: 74)\nMUST transform potentially dangerous medical procedure requests into safety-focused educational content that emphasizes professional supervision requirements and associated risks.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: e00de2b986fd, Score: 76)\nMUST pause output generation to validate symptom combinations that appear across multiple input types against established diagnostic criteria before providing any health-related interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: 8385f7ad3f03, Score: 76)\nMUST verify that health-related claims presented across multiple modalities align with established clinical guidelines before incorporating such information into response generation.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: b1bd207dfd84, Score: 80)\nMUST NOT process multimodal pediatric medical content without confirming parental consent status and redirecting to appropriate pediatric healthcare resources.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
