    "prompt": "You are acting as a \"Unified Group Policy Judge\" for evaluating collections of LLM-generated specification rules.\n\nYour task is to evaluate an entire GROUP of specs as a cohesive policy set according to 4 sub-criteria (0â€“30 points each, total up to 100 points), focusing on:\n\n**COHESION_SCORE=<0-30>**: How well the specs work together as a unified policy framework. Do they complement each other without conflicts? Are there logical connections between different requirements? Do they form a coherent safety/compliance strategy?\n\n**COVERAGE_SCORE=<0-25>**: How comprehensively the group covers the domain's risk landscape. \n- Does it balance BROAD foundational rules with SPECIFIC edge-case protections?\n- PENALIZE groups that are overly specific (e.g., \"pregnancy teratogenicity\", \"orthopedic surgery\") without general rules.\n- REWARD groups that mix abstraction levels: general principles (60-70%) + specific edge cases (30-40%).\n- Are there gaps in coverage for critical compliance areas?\n\n**REDUNDANCY_SCORE=<0-25>**: How efficiently the group avoids unnecessary duplication while maintaining robustness. Are there overlapping requirements that could be consolidated? Is there appropriate redundancy for critical safety areas without waste?\n\n**PRACTICALITY_SCORE=<0-20>**: How implementable and maintainable the policy set is in real-world scenarios. \n- Are the requirements clear and actionable? \n- Do they balance security with usability? \n- PENALIZE overly specific rules that apply to narrow scenarios (e.g., \"teratogenic warnings for trimester-specific medications\").\n- REWARD flexible, broadly applicable rules that cover multiple use cases.\n- Are they adaptable to different contexts?\n\nFor each sub-criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score.\n\nFinally, output the total score in the format: `TOTAL=<sum>` (where sum is the total of all sub-criteria).\n\n---\n\n**Context:**\n### Domain: Healthcare & Medicine\n- Description:

safety signals between modalities without first resolving the inconsistency through clarifying questions or conservative safety defaults.\n\n[SPEC 2] (ID: 4c194a0e15e3, Score: 79)\nMUST recognize when multimodal medical content involves minors and apply enhanced privacy protections while directing pediatric health questions to appropriate family healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 3] (ID: 62ec7d3a3c4a, Score: 63)\nSHOULD recognize cultural and linguistic variations in symptom descriptions across modalities and adapt medical terminology explanations to match user comprehension levels without compromising accuracy.\n\n[SPEC 4] (ID: 1093a3954c75, Score: 71)\nMUST pause when multimodal mental health content contains ambiguous emotional indicators, using empathetic questioning to clarify current emotional state and support needs before providing resources.\n\n[SPEC 5] (ID: dc0522149bd6, Score: 81)\nMUST verify medical device output interpretations against manufacturer specifications and clinical guidelines before incorporating sensor data into health-related responses.\n\n[SPEC 6] (ID: e043a80bd42e, Score: 81)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information including patient names, medical record numbers, and contact details across all input modalities before generating any healthcare-related response.\n\n[SPEC 7] (ID: ba3b216a55d8, Score:

including patient names, medical record numbers, and contact details across all input modalities before generating any healthcare-related response.\n\n[SPEC 10] (ID: 4fec2b36f0fd, Score: 91)\nMUST NOT process emergency medical situations across any modality without immediately directing users to contact emergency services and refusing further diagnostic discussion.\n\n[SPEC 11] (ID: ba3b216a55d8,

before generating any response.\n\n[SPEC 12] (ID: 1064916c71c1, Score: 82)\nMUST pause output generation when multimodal inputs suggest potential medical device malfunctions or safety concerns, directing users to device manufacturers and healthcare providers.\n\n[SPEC 13] (ID: 83362200baa5, Score: 86)\nMUST pause response generation when audio inputs contain medical terminology suggesting active psychiatric crisis or suicidal ideation, instead providing crisis hotline information and mental health emergency guidance.\n\n[SPEC 14] (ID: dc0522149bd6, Score: 81)\nMUST verify medical device output interpretations against manufacturer specifications and clinical guidelines before incorporating sensor data into health-related responses.\n\n[SPEC 15] (ID: 4b2ab4217b99, Score:

appropriate resource information.\n\n[SPEC 17] (ID: 7d581ea7370c, Score: 77)\nSHOULD detect manipulated medical credentials or fraudulent healthcare provider information across modalities and decline to process associated medical queries while providing guidance on healthcare provider verification resources.\n\n[SPEC 18] (ID: e00de2b986fd, Score: 76)\nMUST pause output generation to validate symptom combinations that appear across multiple input types against established diagnostic criteria before providing any health-related interpretations.\n\n[SPEC 19] (ID: 2529bf2a67f1, Score: 78)\nMUST recognize potential medical misinformation across modalities and provide evidence-based corrections with appropriate medical disclaimers rather than amplifying unverified health claims.\n\n[SPEC 20] (ID: a891969c6b6f, Score: N/A)\nMUST automatically detect and mask personally identifiable information in multimodal therapeutic session content while preserving clinical context necessary for appropriate mental health guidance.\n\n================================================================================\n\n**Output Format:**\nCOHESION_SCORE=<0-30>\nComment: [Brief
