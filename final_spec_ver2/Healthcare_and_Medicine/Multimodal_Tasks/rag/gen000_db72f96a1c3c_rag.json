    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together as a unified policy framework. They address various aspects of multimodal healthcare interactions, such as privacy, safety, and accuracy, without significant conflicts. There are logical connections between requirements, such as handling emergency situations, privacy protection, and device verification, forming a coherent safety and compliance strategy.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare and medicine, including privacy, emergency response, device verification, and misinformation. However, there is a slight imbalance with some areas being overly specific, such as repeated emphasis on masking personally identifiable information, which could have been consolidated. The mix of general principles and specific edge cases is present but could be more balanced.",
    "redundancy": "There is noticeable redundancy, particularly with specifications related to masking personally identifiable information, which appear multiple times with slight variations. While redundancy can be beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition here seems unnecessary and could be consolidated to improve efficiency without losing robustness.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on real-world applicability. They balance security with usability, such as directing users to emergency services or verifying device outputs. However, some rules are overly specific, like those concerning specific modalities or scenarios, which could limit flexibility and adaptability across different contexts."
