    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a cohesive policy framework that emphasizes safety and compliance in healthcare-related multimodal tasks. There are logical connections between the rules, such as redirecting emergency situations to appropriate resources and avoiding diagnostic conclusions without professional oversight. However, there are some redundancies, such as repeated specs (e.g., SPEC 3 and SPEC 14), which slightly detract from overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of risks in the healthcare domain, including emergency situations, diagnostic accuracy, and data privacy. It effectively balances general principles with specific edge-case protections, such as handling deepfake imagery and vulnerable populations. However, there could be more foundational rules to address general healthcare communication principles.",
    "redundancy": "There is some unnecessary duplication, such as identical specs (SPEC 3 and SPEC 14) and similar rules (SPEC 5 and SPEC 15), which could be consolidated. While redundancy is appropriate for critical safety areas, the repetition here does not add significant robustness and could be streamlined for efficiency.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on redirecting users to professional resources and ensuring safety. They balance security with usability by providing flexible rules applicable to various scenarios. However, some rules are overly specific, such as those focusing on deepfake detection, which may not be easily implementable across all contexts."
