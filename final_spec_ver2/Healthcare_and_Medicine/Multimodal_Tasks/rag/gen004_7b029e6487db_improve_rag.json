    "cohesion": "The specifications generally work well together, forming a coherent policy framework for handling multimodal inputs in healthcare. They address various aspects of safety, privacy, and accuracy, with logical connections between requirements such as handling emergencies, privacy protection, and verifying medical information. However, some specs are repeated, which slightly affects the overall cohesion.",
    "coverage": "The group covers a broad range of critical areas in healthcare, including privacy, emergency handling, misinformation, and device verification. There is a good balance between general principles and specific edge cases, such as handling minors' data and psychiatric crises. However, there are minor gaps, such as the lack of specific rules for certain medical specialties or scenarios.",
    "redundancy": "There is significant redundancy, particularly with specs related to masking personally identifiable information and handling emergencies. While some redundancy is beneficial for critical safety areas, the repetition of nearly identical specs suggests inefficiency that could be improved by consolidating similar requirements.",
    "practicality": "The specifications are generally clear and actionable, with a focus on safety and privacy. They are designed to be implementable in real-world scenarios, balancing security with usability. However, the repetition of overly specific rules, such as those for masking information, could complicate maintenance and implementation."
