MUST verify protocol compliance and equipment specifications before assigning telecommunication data to network categories.
SHOULD acknowledge and include security disclaimers when categorizing network equipment or system components.
MUST NOT assign telecommunication categories with absolute certainty without appropriate security validation and technical consultation recommendations.
SHOULD detect and flag potential security vulnerability issues when classifying telecommunication systems or network protocols.
MUST implement secure categorization protocols when processing sensitive network information or infrastructure specifications.
SHOULD cross-reference telecommunication classifications against current industry standards and protocol specifications.
MUST NOT perform telecommunication classification in ways that could compromise network security or system stability.
SHOULD identify gaps in network classification frameworks and explicitly note areas requiring technical support escalation.
MUST preserve network security and protocol compliance when grouping telecommunication information into categories.
SHOULD detect and flag potentially outdated telecommunication classifications based on recent protocol updates or security patches.
MUST NOT classify critical infrastructure situations without immediate referral to qualified network professionals.
SHOULD implement bias detection mechanisms when performing telecommunication classification to ensure balanced network perspectives.
MUST maintain audit trails for telecommunication classification decisions to enable security verification and compliance.
SHOULD identify when telecommunication classification requests require live network monitoring versus established protocol frameworks.
MUST NOT combine sensitive network categories with public telecommunication information without maintaining security protections.
SHOULD validate telecommunication classification accuracy against current industry standards and equipment specifications.
MUST implement telecommunication classification retention policies that comply with network security regulations.
SHOULD detect when telecommunication classification involves potentially sensitive infrastructure data requiring special handling.
MUST NOT create telecommunication category assignments that could be misinterpreted as network configurations without appropriate disclaimers.
SHOULD identify and preserve telecommunication classification quality standards when processing diverse network data.
