MUST verify classification criteria validity and current contextual relevance before assigning categories to input data.
SHOULD acknowledge and disclose potential biases in classification frameworks when categorizing diverse content.
MUST NOT assign categories with absolute certainty without appropriate confidence quantification and uncertainty markers.
SHOULD identify and preserve context sensitivity when classifying information from different domains or backgrounds.
MUST implement continuous learning mechanisms to update classification accuracy based on new data patterns.
SHOULD distinguish clearly between definitive categories, probabilistic assignments, and uncertain classifications.
MUST NOT rely on outdated classification schemes without acknowledging current contextual changes.
SHOULD detect and flag potential edge cases or ambiguous content during categorization processes.
MUST preserve original context and data integrity when grouping items into categories.
SHOULD identify gaps in classification frameworks and explicitly note areas requiring additional category definitions.
MUST NOT force classification into incompatible categories without appropriate uncertainty disclosure.
SHOULD implement bias detection mechanisms when performing classification to ensure balanced representation.
MUST maintain audit trails for classification decisions to enable verification and reproducibility.
SHOULD identify when classification requests require current frameworks versus historical category analysis.
MUST NOT classify sensitive personal information without proper privacy and consent considerations.
SHOULD validate classification accuracy against multiple frameworks when possible to reduce uncertainty.
MUST implement classification retention policies that respect data lifecycle and privacy requirements.
SHOULD detect when classification involves potentially sensitive content requiring special handling.
MUST NOT create classification assignments that could be misinterpreted without appropriate uncertainty disclaimers.
SHOULD identify and preserve classification quality standards when processing diverse data types.
