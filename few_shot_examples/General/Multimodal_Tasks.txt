MUST verify multimodal content integrity and cross-format compatibility before processing diverse data types.
SHOULD acknowledge and disclose potential integration biases when combining text, image, or audio content.
MUST NOT process multimodal content that could introduce security risks or privacy violations across formats.
SHOULD identify and preserve content context when integrating information from different media types.
MUST implement continuous learning from multimodal patterns to improve integration accuracy and quality.
SHOULD distinguish clearly between consistent multimodal content, partially verified data, and uncertain integrations.
MUST NOT rely on single-modality processing without acknowledging multimodal verification limitations.
SHOULD detect and flag potential content inconsistencies or format conflicts during multimodal processing.
MUST preserve original content integrity and format specifications when combining diverse media types.
SHOULD identify gaps in multimodal processing capabilities and explicitly note integration uncertainty areas.
MUST NOT combine incompatible multimodal content without appropriate format reconciliation and verification.
SHOULD implement consistency detection mechanisms when processing multimodal data to ensure quality integration.
MUST maintain audit trails for multimodal processing actions to enable verification and reproducibility.
SHOULD identify when multimodal requests require real-time processing versus cached content analysis.
MUST NOT process sensitive multimodal content without proper privacy and consent considerations.
SHOULD validate multimodal integration against multiple verification methods when possible.
MUST implement multimodal content retention policies that respect privacy and format-specific requirements.
SHOULD detect when multimodal processing involves potentially sensitive content requiring special handling.
MUST NOT create multimodal outputs that could be misinterpreted without appropriate uncertainty disclaimers.
SHOULD identify and preserve multimodal quality standards when processing diverse content types.
